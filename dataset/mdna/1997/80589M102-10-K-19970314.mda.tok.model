item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations competition the electric utility industry has begun a major transition that could lead to expanded market competition and less regulation 
deregulation of electric wholesale and retail markets is creating opportunities to compete for new and existing customers and markets 
as a result  profit margins and asset values of some utilities could be adversely affected 
legislative initiatives at the federal and state levels are being considered and  if enacted  could mandate market deregulation 
the pace of deregulation  future prices of electricity  and the regulatory actions which may be taken by the psc and the ferc in response to the changing environment cannot be predicted 
however  recent ferc actions will likely accelerate competition among electric utilities by providing for wholesale transmission access 
in april the ferc issued order  which addresses open access to transmission lines and stranded cost recovery 
order requires utilities under ferc jurisdiction that own  control or operate transmission lines to file nondiscriminatory open access tariffs that offer to others the same transmission service they provide themselves 
the ferc has also permitted utilities to seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs from departing customers by direct assignment 
approximately five percent of the company s electric revenues is under ferc jurisdiction 
the company is aggressively pursuing actions to position itself strategically for the transformed environment 
to enhance its flexibility and responsiveness to change  the company s electric and gas utility  sce g  operates strategic business units 
maintaining a competitive cost structure is of paramount importance in the utility s strategic plan 
sce g has undertaken a variety of initiatives  including reductions in operation and maintenance costs and in staffing levels 
in january the psc approved as discussed under liquidity and capital resources the accelerated recovery of sce g s electric regulatory assets and the shift  for ratemaking purposes  of depreciation reserves from transmission and distribution assets to nuclear production assets 
the ferc has rejected the depreciation reserve transfer for rates subject to its jurisdiction 
in may the ferc approved sce g s application establishing open access transmission tariffs and requesting authorization to sell bulk power to wholesale customers at market based rates 
significant investments are being made in customer and management information systems 
marketing of services to commercial and industrial customers has been increased significantly 
the company believes that these actions as well as numerous others that have been and will be taken demonstrate its ability and commitment to succeed in the new operating environment to come 
regulated public utilities are allowed to record as assets some costs that would be expensed by other enterprises 
if deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment occur  the company may no longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment and may be required to eliminate such regulatory assets from its balance sheet 
although the potential effects of deregulation cannot be determined at present  discontinuation of the accounting treatment could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the period the write off is recorded 
it is expected that cash flows and the financial position of the company would not be materially affected by the discontinuation of the accounting treatment 
the company reported approximately million and million of regulatory assets and liabilities  respectively  including amounts recorded for deferred income tax assets and liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively  on its balance sheet at december  liquidity and capital resources the cash requirements of the company arise primarily from sce g s operational needs  the company s construction program and the need to fund the activities or investments of the company s nonregulated subsidiaries 
the ability of the company s regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment  as well as to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas  will depend upon their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms 
the company s regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers 
rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs 
as customer growth and inflation occur and the regulated subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs  it is necessary to seek increases in rates 
as a result  the company s future financial position and results of operations will be affected by the regulated subsidiaries ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief 
the company and westvaco corporation have formed a limited liability company  cogen south llc  to build and operate a million cogeneration facility at westvaco s kraft division paper mill in north charleston  south carolina 
the company and westvaco each own a interest in the llc 
the facility will provide industrial process steam for the westvaco paper mill and shaft horsepower to enable sce g to generate up to megawatts of electricity 
construction financing is being provided to cogen south llc by banks 
a million capital contribution to the llc by each partner is expected prior to operation of the facility 
in addition to the cogeneration llc  westvaco has entered into a year contract with sce g for all its electricity requirements at the north charleston mill at sce g s standard industrial rate 
construction of the plant began in september and it is expected to be operational in the fall of on august  the city of charleston executed year electric and gas franchise agreements with sce g 
in consideration for the electric franchise agreement  sce g will pay the city million over seven years and has donated to the city the existing transit assets in charleston 
on january  the psc issued an order granting sce g an increase in retail electric rates of  which will produce additional revenues of approximately million annually 
the increase has been implemented in two phases 
the first phase  an increase in revenues of approximately million annually based on a test year  or  commenced in january the second phase  an increase in revenues of approximately million annually  or  was implemented in january the psc authorized a return on common equity of 
the psc also approved establishment of a storm damage reserve account capped at million and collected through rates over a ten year period 
additionally  the psc approved accelerated recovery of a significant portion of sce g s electric regulatory assets excluding deferred income tax assets and the remaining transition obligation for postretirement benefits other than pensions  changing the amortization periods to allow recovery by the end of the year sce g s request to shift  for ratemaking purposes  approximately million of depreciation reserves from transmission and distribution assets to nuclear production assets was also approved 
the psc s ruling does not apply to wholesale electric revenues under the ferc s jurisdiction  which constitute approximately five percent of the company s electric revenues 
the ferc has rejected the transfer of depreciation reserves for rates subject to its jurisdiction 
on august  the psc issued an order effective november   approving changes in pipeline corporation s gas rate design for sales for resale service and upholding the value of service method of regulation for its direct industrial service 
direct industrial customers seeking cost of service based rates initiated two separate appeals to the circuit court  which reversed and remanded to the psc its august  order 
pipeline corporation appealed that decision to the supreme court which on january  reversed the two circuit court decisions and reinstated the psc order 
the supreme court held that the industrial customer group s appeal was premature and failed to exhaust administrative remedies 
additionally  the supreme court interpreted the rate making statutes of south carolina to give discretion to the psc in selecting the methodology to be used in setting rates for natural gas service 
the psc then held another hearing and issued its order dated december  maintaining the present level of the caps 
this order was appealed to the circuit court by pipeline corporation and the industrial customer group with several other parties intervening 
the circuit court judge has written a letter to the parties indicating that he will rule to require the psc to set an overall rate of return 
however  no order has been issued 
the impact  if any  on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position is not presently determinable

environmental matters the clean air act requires electric utilities to reduce substantially emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide by the year these requirements are being phased in over two periods 
the first phase had a compliance date of january  and the second  january  the company s facilities did not require modifications to meet the requirements of phase i 
the company will most likely meet the phase ii requirements through the burning of natural gas and or lower sulfur coal in its generating units and the purchase and use of sulfur dioxide emission allowances 
low nitrogen oxide burners are being installed to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions to the levels required by phase ii 
air toxicity regulations for the electric generating industry are likely to be promulgated around the year during the company filed compliance plans related to phase ii requirements with dhec 
the company currently estimates that air emissions control equipment will require capital expenditures of million over the period to retrofit existing facilities  with increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately million per year 
to meet compliance requirements through the year  the company anticipates total capital expenditures of approximately million 
the federal clean water act  as amended  provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require various levels of treatment for each wastewater discharge 
under this act  compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program 
discharge permits have been issued for all and renewed for nearly all of sce g s and genco s generating units 
concurrent with renewal of these permits  the permitting agency has implemented more rigorous control programs 
the company has been developing compliance plans for this program 
amendments to the clean water act proposed in congress include several provisions which  if passed  could prove costly to sce g 
these include limitations to mixing zones and the implementation of technology based standards 
the south carolina solid waste policy and management act of directed dhec to promulgate regulations for the disposal of industrial solid waste 
dhec has promulgated a proposed regulation  which  if adopted as a final regulation in its present form  would significantly increase sce g s and genco s costs of construction and operation of existing and future ash management facilities 
the company has an environmental assessment program to identify and assess current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup 
as site assessments are initiated  estimates are made of the cost  if any  to investigate and clean up each site 
these estimates are refined as additional information becomes available  therefore  actual expenditures could differ significantly from original estimates 
amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and cleanup and environmental claims settlements relate primarily to regulated operations  such amounts are deferred and are being amortized and recovered through rates over a five year period for electric operations and an eight year period for gas operations 
deferred amounts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the deferral includes the estimated costs associated with the matters discussed below 
in september the epa notified sce g  the city of charleston and the charleston housing authority of their potential liability for the investigation and cleanup of the calhoun park area site in charleston  south carolina 
this site originally encompassed approximately eighteen acres and included properties which were the locations for industrial operations  including a wood preserving creosote plant and one of sce g s decommissioned manufactured gas plants 
the original scope of this investigation has been expanded to approximately acres  including adjacent properties owned by the national park service  the city of charleston and private properties 
the site has not been placed on the national priority list  but may be added before cleanup is initiated 
the prps have agreed with the epa to participate in an innovative approach to site investigation and cleanup called superfund accelerated cleanup model  allowing the pre cleanup site investigation process to be compressed significantly 
the prps have negotiated an administrative order by consent for the conduct of a remedial investigation feasibility study and a corresponding scope of work 
field work began in november and a draft remedial investigation report was submitted to the epa in february sce g resolved second and third round comments and submitted a final draft remedial investigation report in october although sce g is continuing to investigate cost effective cleanup methodologies  further work is pending epa approval of the final draft remedial investigation report 
in october the city of charleston and sce g settled all environmental claims the city may have had against sce g involving the calhoun park area for a payment of million over four years by sce g to the city 
sce g is recovering the amount of the settlement  which does not encompass site assessment and cleanup costs  through rates in the same manner as other amounts accrued for site assessments and cleanup 
as part of the environmental settlement  sce g has agreed to construct an  space parking garage on the calhoun park site and to transfer the facility to the city in exchange for a year municipal bond backed by revenues from the parking garage and a mortgage on the parking garage 
the total amount of the bond is not to exceed million  the maximum expected project cost 
sce g owns three other decommissioned manufactured gas plant sites which contain residues of by product chemicals 
sce g maintains an active review of the sites to monitor the nature and extent of the residual contamination 
sce g is pursuing recovery of environmental liabilities from appropriate pollution insurance carriers 
regulatory matters sce g filed for electric rate relief in to encompass primarily the remaining costs of completing the cope generating station 
as discussed under liquidity and capital resources  the psc issued an order on january  increasing electric retail rates 
the company s regulated business operations were impacted by the nepa and ferc orders no 
and nepa was designed to create a more competitive wholesale power supply market by creating exempt wholesale generators and by potentially requiring utilities owning transmission facilities to provide transmission access to wholesalers 
see competition for a discussion of ferc order order no 
was intended to deregulate the markets for interstate sales of natural gas by requiring that pipelines provide transportation services that are equal in quality for all gas suppliers whether the customer purchases gas from the pipeline or another supplier 
in the opinion of the company  it continues to be able to meet successfully the challenges of these altered business climates and does not anticipate there to be any material adverse impact on the results of operations  cash flows  financial position or business prospects

results of operations earnings and dividends earnings per share of common stock  the percent increase decrease from the previous year and the rate of return earned on common equity for the years through were as follows earnings per weighted average share percent increase decrease in earnings per share return earned on common equity year end earnings per share and return on common equity increased primarily as a result of higher electric sales margins at sce g and improved earnings at petroleum resources which more than offset increases in operating expenses 
additionally  sci reported a nonrecurring after tax gain of million as a result of the business combination of powertel pcs partners and intercel in february earnings per share and return on common equity increased primarily as a result of improved results of operations at petroleum resources  which recorded net losses of million in and million in higher electric and gas margins and lower operation and maintenance costs  which more than offset the negative impact of higher fixed costs  also contributed to the favorable earnings performance in the company s financial statements include afc 
afc is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress is capitalized 
an equity portion of afc is included in nonoperating income and a debt portion of afc is included in interest charges credits as noncash items  both of which have the effect of increasing reported net income 
afc represented approximately of income before income taxes in  in and in in scana s board of directors raised the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to cents per share from cents per share 
the increase  effective with the dividend payable on april   raised the indicated annual dividend rate to per share from 
scana has increased the dividend rate on its common stock in of the last years 
electric operations electric sales margins for  and were as follows millions of dollars electric operating revenues   less fuel used in electric generation purchased power margin the electric sales margin increased primarily as a result of the rate increase received by sce g in january economic growth factors also contributed to the increase 
the electric sales margin increased primarily as a result of the combined impact of warmer weather in the third quarter of  colder weather in the fourth quarter of and the base rate increase received by the company in mid these factors more than offset the negative impact of milder weather experienced during the first half of increases decreases from the prior year in megawatt hour mwh sales volume by classes were as follows classification residential   commercial   industrial   sale for resale excluding interchange   other   total territorial   interchange   total   interchange sales volume for increased as a result of additional capacity resulting from the startup of the cope plant in early gas operations gas sales margins for  and were as follows millions of dollars gas operating revenues less gas purchased for resale margin the gas sales margin decreased primarily as a result of higher gas costs and curtailments imposed on interruptible industrial customers during abnormally cold weather 
also  contributing to the decline in the gas sales margin from to were lower gas prices in which allowed pipeline corporation to compete more successfully in that year with alternate fuel suppliers in industrial markets 
the gas sales margin increased primarily as a result of lower gas costs which allowed pipeline corporation to compete successfully with alternate fuel suppliers in industrial markets 
a shifting of transportation customers to the industrial class and an increase in interruptible gas sales also contributed to the improved margin 
increases decreases from the prior year in dekatherm dt sales volume by classes  including transportation gas  were as follows classification residential   commercial   industrial   sale for resale   transportation gas   total   other operating expenses and taxes increases decreases in other operating expenses  including taxes  were as follows classification millions of dollars other operation and maintenance depreciation and amortization income taxes other taxes total other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily as a result of higher production costs attributable to the cope plant which became operational in january  the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses reflects the addition of the cope plant and other additions to plant in service 
the increase in income tax expense corresponds to the increase in operating income 
the increase in other taxes reflects higher property taxes resulting from property additions and higher millages and assessments 
other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily as a result of lower pension costs and lower costs at electric generating stations 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses is primarily attributable to additions to plant in service and the write off of certain software costs 
the increase in income tax expense corresponds to the increase in operating income 
the increase in other taxes reflects higher property taxes resulting from higher millages and assessments partially offset by lower payroll taxes resulting from early retirements of employees 
other income other income  net of taxes  increased approximately million in primarily due to the improved earnings performance of petroleum resources attributable to a noncash reserve adjustment recorded in the second quarter of and to higher gas prices and lower production costs 
the gain reported by sci  discussed under earnings and dividends is also included in other income reported for other income  net of taxes  increased million in primarily due to the improved earnings performance of petroleum resources as discussed under earnings and dividends 
interest expense increases decreases in interest expense  excluding the debt component of afc  were as follows classification millions of dollars interest on long term debt  net other interest expense total the decrease in interest expense is due primarily to reductions in outstanding debt throughout most of the year
