a significant portion of the company s growth occurred with the merger of taylor in fiscal in connection with the integration of taylor into pss  the company closed or merged into existing pss service centers the majority of the taylor locations 
additionally  the company merged eight pss service centers into the eight remaining taylor locations and established two additional service centers 
sales growth and mix in addition to the opening of new service centers and the acquisition of local medical supply and equipment distributors  pss sales growth is largely attributable to high levels of same center sales growth 
pss quantifies same center sales by aggregating the sales for service centers which have been in operation for at least two consecutive month periods 
the following table sets forth the same center sales growth of the core business for the periods indicated fiscal year ended number of centers per period same center sales growth excludes taylor centers 
this same center sales growth has been accomplished by i focusing on diagnostic equipment which produces residual sales of reagents  ii productivity gains of its maturing sales force  iii pursuing customer reach and penetration  and iv accessing new products not previously distributed

the company recently completed the second year of a distributorship agreement the abbott agreement with abbott laboratories providing for the exclusive distribution of certain abbott diagnostic products 
gross profits for abbott product sales converted to pss are generally substantially less than standard pss margins 
the average gross profit on sales of abbott products by the company s core business was and for fiscal and  respectively 
gross profits on these products have gradually improved over the term of the relationship 
pss and abbott are currently negotiating fiscal performance goals and related acquisition cost of product 
the company has focused on a comprehensive and consultative sales approach with an emphasis on diagnostic products  which includes sophisticated diagnostic equipment and supplies related to the use of such equipment 
as a result  the company has been able to expand and increase its diagnostic products sales in periods of uncertainty in the health care market 
additionally  as manufacturers search for means to reduce sales and marketing expenses  pss has used its expertise and market reach to distribute products to physicians as evidenced by the increase in total sales dollars of diagnostic equipment and pharmaceuticals 
pss distributes in the core business selected items from substantially all major product lines of medical supplies and equipment 
pss currently sells a broad range of medical supplies which include over  stock keeping units  including various types and sizes of paper goods  needles and syringes  gauze and wound dressings  sutures  latex gloves  orthopedic soft goods and casting products  wood tongue blades and applicators  sterilization and intravenous solutions  specimen containers  diagnostic equipment reagents  and diagnostic rapid test kits for pregnancy  strep  chlamydia  h pylori  and bladder cancer

demand for diagnostic equipment has increased recently  reflecting in part  technological advances which enable increasingly sophisticated diagnostic tests to be performed in the physician s office 
sales of diagnostic equipment  while generally lower in gross margin than supplies  normally require the ongoing reordering of disposable diagnostic reagents which generally yield higher margins 
the abbott agreement has positioned pss as the sole distributor for the cell dyn r  and hematology products  abbott vision r products  imx r products  and the abbott testpack r line of rapid tests sold to physician offices with or less physicians per geographic location 
the company s pharmaceutical sales include vaccines  injectables and ointments 
as a result of the changing dynamics in the pharmaceutical industry  particularly the reduction in sales force for physicians offices  pharmaceutical manufacturers are increasingly seeking alternative means of distribution 
the company believes that its consultative sales approach and its emphasis on training have allowed pss to be highly effective in selling pharmaceuticals to the physician office market 
pss has implemented a new penny saver product line 
the penny saver products represent the most frequently used products by pss customers 
this product line will provide customers a choice between name brand products and the penny saver quality  low price alternatives 
currently  the company has over products under the penny saver label 
pss plans to continue to focus on providing products and services to the primary care physician market whether the physician is a single practitioner or a member of a large group practice 
in that effort  pss developed network plus sm  a comprehensive savings plan for physicians in which pss offers special group purchasing contract pricing and provides periodic cost analyses to help manage the supply needs of each physician 
under this program  when a physician office guarantees at least of its purchase volume to pss  the company will guarantee the lowest purchase prices on certain products as well as certain service guarantees 
in addition to this program  the company has recently signed distribution agreements with several national and regional integrated and managed care groups 
the company recently entered into four separate exclusive distribution agreements for certain products manufactured by siemens medical systems  inc  hologic  inc  bard diagnostic sciences  inc 
and tanita corporation of america  inc these strategic alliances should continue to broaden the company s product offerings to both the core business and imaging division customers

this division began operations in november with the acquisition of service centers  sales representatives and field service engineers 
currently  the imaging division provides service to approximately  acute and alternate site customers through service centers  sales representatives and field service engineers 
the field service engineers service products ranging from processors to radiographic equipment 
the company s objective for the imaging division this year is to i continue geographic expansion with acquisitions of local and regional imaging distributors to leverage existing infrastructure  ii develop and implement a separate hardware and software system for the division utilizing the core business icon sm and customerlink systems  iii expand the products and services currently provided  iv implement same day delivery  and v develop a university training program specifically tailored for the division
