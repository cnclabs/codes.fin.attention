per share compared to  or 
per share in and  or 
per share in increases in expenses associated with allic s marketing activities and a minimal increase in the sale of new international life insurance premiums caused the decline in earnings in decreased writing of new life insurance premiums contributed to the lower earnings in  coupled with increased operating expenses incurred to acquire and convert alfc 
total revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  in  an increase of 
the substantial revenue growth in is attributable to the inclusion of allic for the entire year  which contributed approximately  to revenues 
the revenues were greater than when total revenues were  the smaller increase in revenues during resulted primarily from a reduction in new premium sales  whose decline offset increased investment income during the year 
in  the revenues of allic are included only from the purchase date of september   and as such  only million of allic s total revenues of million were included in the company s results 
premium income reached  in  a increase over the previous year when premium income totaled  the amount represented a increase over when premiums amounted to  premiums for were boosted by the inclusion of allic 
allic contributed million of accident and health premium and an additional million of life premiums 
additionally  cica increased new premium sales to million during the year from million in  which was a decrease from million in in and  management did not emphasize new business production due to its desire to increase company capitalization before further expanding its premium writing 
additionally  during  the company saw significant disruption in the argentine economy  lowering sales from that region which had been a major contributor to the company s overall sales in recent years 
management believes the disruption has passed in that market and expects to see improved production from that area in the future although these expectations may not be realized for a variety of reasons including political and governmental disturbances  economic disturbances and other factors beyond the company s control 
additionally  only a small portion of the premium revenues of allic are included in the results as described above 
during late and  management made a significant effort to expand the writing of pre need insurance on the part of allic 
included in this effort was the addition of several field agency managers  the design of new products  and printing of promotional materials 
despite this commitment and incurrence of approximately  in expenses  management abandoned these efforts late in it is management s belief that allic is better served to continue to exploit its niche selling specialty accident and health life products through existing distribution channels although factors such as the reaction of the remaining allic sales representatives to discontinuation of this effort as well as general competitive factors will affect the actual outcome 
because only a nominal amount of new premium was written through the now discontinued expansion efforts  management does not expect the change in focus to have a material effect on new sales 
management does  however  believe that the loss of momentum as a result of withdrawal of the program will cause a disruption in allic s sales 
the annual sales of new premiums produced by allic represents less than of total new premiums produced by the company  therefore management does not believe this will have an adverse effect on the company 
net investment income increased during to  from  in in  such income was  the results reflect actions taken during late and early to extend the duration of the company s portfolio slightly to take advantage of higher yields 
overall  the duration was increased to approximately years from to years 
additionally  the acquisition of allic which increased the company s invested assets by approximately million  contributed  along with the company s own internal growth 
allic represented  of s investment income  however  this amount represented only slightly more than three months of earnings on that asset base 
in  the contribution was million 
the low yields available in the bond market during the company s growth period have made it difficult to increase the return on the company s invested assets without exposing the portfolio to undue risk  however  management believes that as yields rise which occurred during and early and again in late the company is positioned to take advantage of the investment opportunities that will present themselves and  thus  enhance future returns 
management hired the investment advisory firm of asset allocation and management  inc of chicago aam  illinois in late to manage the company s fixed maturity portfolio 
it is the belief of management that an overall increase in returns can be achieved by implementing the plans of aam to provide more diversity in the portfolio without significantly increasing risk 
during  a nominal reconfiguration was begun 
in lieu of purchasing us treasury instruments  the company began to purchase us government guaranteed mortgage pass through securities 
management believes that an approximate basis point increase in return can be achieved through the switch assuming current market yields do not decline 
additionally  approximately million of a to aa rated private placement bonds were acquired 
management expects to continue this strategy throughout as opportunities present themselves 
future policy benefit reserves increased  in  compared to  in and  in increased surrender activity during the year was the primary reason for the lower reserve increase in the decreased production in  coupled with lower reserves as a result of a lower capitalization rate on policy acquisition costs  along with higher surrender activity in the international market as a result of the disruption described above  were the reasons for the lower reserve increase in increasing premium income and favorable persistency in relation to premiums are the primary reasons for the increase in increases in surrender activity on the block of universal life business acquired in the first centennial corp 
acquisition in slowed the level of increase  particularly in these surrenders  which were expected by management  were increased by the relatively low interest rates paid on these plans during compared to the rates that were in effect several years ago when the plans were sold 
additionally  in the early years of a policy  the net reserves benefit reserve less deferred acquisition costs are small due to the large capitalized costs in the first and second policy years 
as the policy matures  the reserve increases 
the company s reserves are certified annually by an independent actuary 
such certification noted no deficiencies for the years presented 
overall policyholder dividends remained relatively stable in amounting to  from  in and  in in late  management reduced the dividends paid on various plans to reflect the lower levels of return that were available in the bond market 
as a result  the dividends paid in recent years have not been growing 
virtually all cica s policies that have been sold since are participating 
participating policies represent a large majority of the company s business in force and over of new issues in and as a result  management expects continued growth in this item subject to factors such as persistency and future sales  however  dividends are factored into the policies premiums and thus management does not believe continued increases in dividend expense will impair or dilute future profitability 
claims and surrenders increased in  reaching  from  in in  such expenses were  the increases result primarily from growth in surrenders and endowments 
death benefits increased to  in  compared to  in in  such benefits were  allic claims amount to  of the results 
a large portion of the increase  is attributable to the acquisition of allic in september 
the remaining increase in is due to the growth in the company s in force business 
during  the claims incurred on the servicemen s group life insurance segli program returned to levels seen prior to  declining by approximately  additionally  during claims on the company s in force business remained static with those incurred in  despite the increasing block of business in force 
the company has historically adhered to a strict underwriting policy which requires complete medical examinations on all applicants who are foreign residents  except children  regardless of age or face amount of the policy applied for 
for and future years  management initiated a change to more selective medical examinations in conjunction with dry spot blood tests and extensive medical questions on the application in order to lower the cost of new business without sacrificing necessary information for the underwriter 
additionally  x rays and electrocardiograms are required depending on age and face amount of the policy 
on all policies of  or more  inspection reports are required which detail the background resources and lifestyle of the applicant 
the company has developed numerous contacts throughout latin america with which its underwriters can validate information contained in the application  medical or inspection report 
the relatively high death claims experienced on the allic block of business are expected due to the nature of the business burial insurance and the higher ages associated with such business 
endowment expense grew from  in to  in  a increase 
in  such expenses were  beginning in late  citizens introduced a new series of plans called ultra expansion plus which carried an immediate endowment benefit of an amount elected by the policyowner 
this endowment is factored into the premium of the policy and is paid annually 
management does not expect this benefit to adversely impact profitability since it is factored into the cost of the policy 
policy surrenders were  in  compared to  in and  in the increase in surrenders is  in the opinion of management  due to acquisitions and the growing block of business in force  as well as representative of the economic problems seen in argentina during and early during  commissions increased to  from  in during  commissions declined to  from  in the majority of such amounts paid relates to first year commissions which were   and  respectively  in   and the increases relate to improved sales activity in cica and approximately million associated with allic 
the decline in first year commissions during relates to the slowdown in new sales discussed earlier 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses increased to  in from  in and  in the expenses include approximately associated with allic 
due to the consolidation of allic s operations with cica  management believes significant reductions can be achieved through economies of scale 
in order to convert a majority of cica s marketing overhead from fixed to variable  management began discussions in early with an independent international marketing company to serve as managing agent for the company s international marketing activities 
this firm would receive an overriding commission on all new business sold internationally in exchange for the absorption of all marketing management and promotion activities 
by taking such actions  management believes approximately  of fixed overhead can be converted to a variable expense in and thereafter 
management has utilized firms such as this in previous periods with great success at obtaining increases in sales and expense reductions 
additionally  management undertook the expense reductions associated with allic s marketing operations discussed previously 
these actions should result in an additional  of annual overhead reduction in future periods based upon the level of expenditures and the factors described earlier regarding the discontinued marketing operations 
the expense increase reflects the growth experienced by the company in recent years  particularly in the marketing area 
as a result of a change in late in the management of marketing efforts  the company absorbs a greater portion of the expense in exchange for paying lower first year commissions 
the growth in expense in is primarily related to the increased home office marketing costs 
capitalized deferred policy acquisition costs were  in  compared to  in and  in the decline in amounts in reflects the lower level of new sales experienced during the year  as well as the lower interest rate environment 
there was an adjustment of capitalization for and after issued policies to reflect the lower interest rates available to be earned on the company s investment portfolio compared to earlier years 
amortization of these costs was   and  respectively in   and the increased surrender activity discussed above contributed to the increased amortization in amortization of cost of insurance acquired and excess of cost over net assets acquired increased to  in from  in and  in the increase is attributable to the goodwill and cost of insurance recorded on the acquisitions of allic and iih 
liquidity and capital resources stockholders equity increased to  at december  from  in the acquisition of iih and the income earned during the period were the primary reasons for the growth in equity during the iih acquisition discussed previously  increased invested assets by  and stockholders equity by  the increase in equity during the year would have been greater but for a  unrealized loss net of tax on the company s available for sale bond portfolio 
this unrealized loss was attributable to decreases in prices in the bond market in on october   citizens completed the offering of  shares of its class a common stock under an exemption from registration under the securities act of the offering was made under regulation s  which permits shares offered outside of the united states to non united stated persons pursuant to its guidelines may be resold in the united states by persons who are not an issuer  underwriter or dealer following a certain period after the close of the offering period 
the offering price was per share 
the closing market price of the class a common shares on the date of the offering commencement was per share as reported by the american stock exchange 
the company sold  shares  generating gross proceeds of more than million  and net proceeds of approximately million 
management was pleased with the amount of capital generated through the offering  however  it believes that the offering period was too short in light of the manner in which business is typically transacted overseas 
because of the success of the offering in the limited time period  a second offering was initiated in may the second offering  to the company s international policyholders  expires in october  it currently prices the shares at and requires a three year holding period 
as of december   approximately  shares had been purchased through the second reg 
s offering  resulting in a net increase to capital of  invested assets grew to  in from  at december   an increase of 
the acquisition of iih contributed approximately million to said increase 
the balance of the growth is attributable to the internal growth achieved by the company
