imnet develops  markets  installs and services electronic information and document management systems to meet the needs of the healthcare industry and other document intensive businesses 
the company  which was incorporated on may   acquired the electronic imaging assets of imge  inc on october  from may  through october   the company s activities consisted primarily of efforts to raise funds and to negotiate the acquisition 
imnet s products include proprietary and third party software and hardware components which are integrated to create electronic information and document management systems 
imnet supports its customers through a broad range of customization  systems integration  installation  training and maintenance services 
the company s revenues are derived primarily from the sale and support of components of the imnet electronic information warehouse the imnet image engine  the imnet workflow engine  imnet medvision  the imnet electronic patient record system eprs  imnet eprs web  imnet laserarc  and the imnet application programming interfaces 
revenues from system sales consist of imnet and third party hardware and software license fees 
sources of maintenance and professional services revenues include services for installation and training  as well as maintenance and service contracts for software and certain hardware support 
imnet systems are sold directly to end users as well as through third party distribution partners 
although the company s relationships with its hcis distribution partners are relatively new  the company expects that sales to and through its hcis distribution partners will continue to increase 
revenues from sales to the healthcare industry increased to of total revenues in fiscal from of total revenues in fiscal the company anticipates that sales to the healthcare industry will continue to increase as a percentage of total annual revenues  although such sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
revenues from sales outside of the united states declined to of total revenues in fiscal from in fiscal on june   the company acquired advisoft  a french systems integration and consulting services company which had been its distribution partner in france since accordingly  the amount of revenues derived and the percentage of total revenues from sales outside the united states is expected to increase in fiscal the company s typical sale of a software license to an end user customer involves several milestones  beginning with the execution of the agreement between the company and the customer 
the agreement describes the software license terms  any hardware to be ordered  and if any services and maintenance are to be performed 
the company and the customer mutually agree upon functional specifications as to the operating environment  number of terminals  response times  etc 
the company then assembles the hardware components required to demonstrate compliance with the functional specifications  at the company s offices  and loads the company s and other third party proprietary software 
the configured system is then used to demonstrate that the system meets the functional specifications 
the company and the customer participate in this process 
when all functional specifications have been demonstrated  the customer signs a written acknowledgement signifying the completion of factory acceptance 
the company repackages the software and hardware components  which are picked up by common carrier and delivered to the customer 
at this point  the company recognizes of the hardware revenue and of the software license revenue 
the company assists the customer in the installation of the system at the customer s location and assists the customer in loading the customer s information 
the company and the customer mutually review each of the functional specifications in the customer s environment  to confirm that the configured system meets the functional specifications 
when there is mutual agreement that all functional specifications have been met  the customer signs a written acknowledgement signifying completion of site acceptance 
the company then recognizes the remaining of software license revenue which was deferred at the time of factory acceptance and delivery 
on occasion  as for example when an existing end user previously has accepted a software product  an end user may elect to waive the factory and site acceptance procedures 
in such instances  the end user becomes obligated to pay upon delivery of the software product and the company recognizes of the revenue from the software license 
as noted in the description of a typical transaction with an end user customer  the company recognizes revenues derived from system sales to end user customers  including of software license fees and of hardware revenues  upon the factory acceptance by the customer provided that acceptance is a condition of the agreement and delivery of the configured system 
the company defers recognition of of the software license fees until completion of certain insignificant vendor obligations primarily related to the site acceptance by the customer 
the company recognizes of revenues from enterprise wide licenses of software to end users upon delivery of the software  assuming there are no further significant vendor obligations 
revenues derived from system sales to distribution partners are recognized upon delivery  if the payment terms are fixed with all amounts due within twelve months  there are no other significant obligations to be performed by the company and the distribution partner meets the company s criteria with respect to sell through and credit risk 
revenue recognition for system sales to end users that have been delivered and accepted by the customer with contractual payment terms that extend beyond one year is determined by the company based upon the company s historical experience with the customer  the customer s credit worthiness  and an assessment of the enforceability of the contract 
all revenues recognized related to contracts with payments due in more than one year are discounted 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company recognized revenue on one arrangement that included payments beyond one year 
that contract was with mclaren regional healthcare corporation 
revenues from professional services  which may include preparation of functional specifications  systems integration  and training  among others  are recognized as the services are performed 
revenues derived from maintenance and support contracts are recognized ratably over the terms of the related contracts 
deferred revenues represent either billings rendered to or payments received from customers for systems prior to factory acceptance and delivery to the customer and maintenance and support services billed in advance 
at june   the company had approximately million of signed sales contracts for systems and services which had not yet been delivered 
the amount of signed sales contracts for systems and services which have not been delivered includes contracts for software license fees  hardware sales and maintenance and professional services that may include cancellation provisions that do not pertain to imnet s performance  and contracts that are expected to result in revenues over periods of as much as five years 
any significant or ongoing failure to achieve signed contracts and subsequent customer acceptance after expending time  effort and funds could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
because the company adjusts the timing of an installation to accommodate customers needs and a typical end user installation requires from one to months to complete  the company is unable to predict accurately the number of signed sales contracts it expects to fill and consequently the amount of revenues it expects to achieve in any particular period 
the company capitalizes a portion of its computer software development costs 
these costs relate primarily to the development of new products and enhancements to existing products to accommodate new markets or platforms using existing technologies and programming methods 
amortization of computer software development costs is provided by the company on individual products or enhancements and begins when the product or enhancement is available for use by customers 
amortization is recorded using the greater of the amount computed using the ratio of current product revenue to the total of current and anticipated product revenue or the amount determined using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software  not to exceed three years

the company has experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results which may continue in future periods 
the company s revenues from system sales have varied significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of the volume and timing of system sales and customer acceptance and delivery 
professional services revenues have also fluctuated from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of the installation of software and hardware  project management and customized programming 
revenues from maintenance services have not fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter and have been increasing as the number of the company s customers increases 
since a significant percentage of the company s expenses are fixed  quarterly operating results will vary with the timing and fluctuation of total revenues 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception in  the company has funded its operations  working capital needs and capital expenditures primarily from revenues and sales of equity securities 
the company was initially capitalized primarily by three investment companies 
subsequently  the company completed four private placements in which new investors purchased company securities

the cash dividends paid on common stock disclosed in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and cash flows for the years ended june    and were normal stockholder distributions paid by hunter prior to the merger  accounted for as a pooling of interests 
imnet has not paid any dividends on its common stock 
the company plans to continue to increase its professional staff during fiscal and the foreseeable future  to meet anticipated sales volume and to support research and development efforts 
the company also anticipates increased costs associated with its acquisition of advisoft 
the company expects that its requirements for office facilities and office equipment will grow as staffing requirements dictate 
the company began the fiscal year leasing  square feet of office space 
to accommodate continuing growth  the company signed an operating lease  effective january  to increase its headquarters space to  square feet 
in october  the company signed an additional operating lease increasing the leased square footage to  as a result  the company will incur increased rental expense 
the company has budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal for the purchase of computer equipment for existing and new employees  furniture and fixtures  and equipment associated with the new office facility  new training equipment  and new equipment for customer demonstrations 
the company s accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso continued to increase in fiscal management believes that its willingness to grant extended billing and payment terms  on a negotiated  case by case basis  provides the customer or distributor with additional incentives to commit to large purchases  because such terms i demonstrate that the company is comfortable with providing the purchaser the leverage inherent in deferred payments thereby demonstrating its confidence in its product  and ii permit the purchaser and the company to commit to a large order  while the payment stream is tailored to a longer period of time thereby providing the purchaser with a means to finance the project over one or more internal cash budgeting cycles 
therefore  management believes the accounts receivable dso trend will continue in fiscal  due to the extended terms selling strategy 
however  the failure by customers to pay significant amounts as they become due would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company has a licensing agreement which obligates the company to pay of net license fee revenue from new licenses of certain of its products 
the agreement commences on july  and continues through december  the company has paid  in advance to be offset against amounts due under this agreement 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  along with net cash flows provided from operations  will be sufficient to finance expected cash requirements for operating activities and anticipated growth for at least the next months 
the company s ability to meet its cash obligations on a long term basis will depend on its achieving and maintaining profitable operations and on consistent and timely collection of its accounts receivable 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s revenues or income 
the company will require significant funds to implement its business strategies 
the company may experience losses due to the following factors i the company s operating expenses are budgeted on anticipated revenues  ii the company incurs significant expenses in connection with research and development  as well as the development of its direct and indirect selling and marketing efforts  and iii a high percentage of the company s expenses are fixed  iv the company may incur charges related to acquisitions and business alliances 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable in the future or that available funds  together with any funds provided by operations  will be sufficient to fund the company s ongoing operations 
if the company has insufficient funds  there can be no assurance that additional financing can be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
the absence of such financing would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  including a possible reduction or cessation of operations 
in addition  certain risk factors  among others  should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
these risk factors include the following i limited operating history  lack of profitable operations  ii variability in quarterly operating results  volatility of stock price  iii customer concentration  iv product acceptance and market development  dependence on distribution partners  v long sales and delivery cycle  dependence on future system sales  vi ability to manage growth  vii risks associated with acquisitions  viii technological changes  competition  ix uncertainty in healthcare industry  government healthcare reform proposals  x dependence on key personnel  xi dependence on proprietary rights and patents  xii product liability  and xiii foreign operations
