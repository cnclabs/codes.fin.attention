operations net sales increased  or to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the majority of the company s product lines sustained relatively level sales volumes as compared to fiscal with the increased volumes related directly to increases in marine  custom molded products and customer tooling 
custom molded products reported an impressive increase over prior year volumes 
management attributes this gain to its experienced sales engineering staff s ability to expand the company s marketshare of these products 
during the last several years the company has also capitalized on the roto molding industry s overall expanding marketplace for its products 
in fiscal  we experienced a lackluster marketplace due to the volatile resin prices and then what appeared to be a return of consumer confidence in fiscal however  certain analysts in the industry have indicated that the industry appears to have reached a temporary plateau 
management is watching these trends to ascertain what impact  if any  it will have on the company s growth projections 
in fiscal  the company continued to reinvest a large portion of its cashflows to expand its manufacturing capacity and operations 
in the later part of fiscal  the company also purchased a new facility in commerce city  colorado and by year end had relocated its colorado operations into this larger facility 
management believes this region offers great growth potential and will strive for similar performance that the illinois facility has obtained since its relocation in fiscal net sales for fiscal were relatively consistent with prior year results reporting net sales of  compared to  for fiscal fiscal was a challenging year for the company as well as the roto molding industry in general due to tremendous fluctuations in raw material which in turn caused confusion and anxiety in the marketplace 
management was pleased that in spite of these adverse conditions it was still able to maintain its overall market share 
in fiscal  the company closed its wisconsin facility and combined the operations into its illinois facility 
during this transition the company did realize an overall reduction in sales volumes 
however  since completion of the relocation process during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the restructured illinois facility is primed to handle increased sales volumes 
management anticipates realizing increased volumes in this region as it capitalizes on illinois facilities resources  increased capacity and growth potential 
again  due to a lackluster marketplace in fiscal  several of the company s proprietary product lines fell below fiscal sales volume levels but  the company also reported notable increases in marine  custom  customer tooling and medical waste sales which aided to minimize any shortfalls realized 
the company continues to see future growth potential in these aforementioned product lines as well as continued focus to increase market share for its material handling and agricultural product lines 
cost of goods was  or of net sales in fiscal compared to  or and  or of net sales in fiscal and since fiscal  the roto molding industry has experienced extreme volatility in plastic resin prices 
these price increases have resulted in approximately a increase in raw material prices per pound since the beginning of this three year period 
the price increases were enacted by the various resin suppliers in response to domestic and foreign material demands as well as various natural and internal disasters experienced by the resin suppliers 
the cost of plastic resin represents a significant portion of the company s manufacturing costs and has continually challenged the company to effectively mitigate these increases 
since fiscal  the company was relatively successful in mitigating these resin price increases by initiating customer price increases and various raw material purchasing strategies 
in fiscal  the company also benefited from increased volumes of custom molded products 
pricing structures for custom molded products typically follow market trends and allow the company to obtain gross margin levels consistent with company objectives 
between fiscal and  the company experienced increased costs as it depleted lower priced resin reserves and replaced them with resin purchased at higher market prices 
these costs were partially mitigated during the remainder of fiscal using the strategies mentioned above coupled with temporary restructure in resin prices and improved customer buying trends 
as the company moves forward into fiscal  management will continue to monitor and take the necessary defensive tactics to minimize future increases in resin prices 
if resin prices do not stabilize and the marketplace reacts adversely to future pricing structures these factors could have an effect on the company s gross profit margin in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of net sales in fiscal compared to  or of net sales in fiscal the overall decrease is primarily attributable to the increase in sales volumes and management s ability to keep these costs in synch with the current sales volume levels 
management continued the restructuring of its sales engineering staff in fiscal the changes enacted have had a positive impact on the company s sales growth with a minimal impact to increased selling costs 
the company has also benefited from the operating efficiencies realized since the completed consolidation of the illinois and wisconsin facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of net sales in fiscal compared to  or in fiscal the increase is substantially attributed to approximately  in additional expenses incurred associated with the arleta  california facility which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal the remaining increase is attributed to increased professional fees of approximately  associated with a proposed acquisition of the company and approximately  in excess administrative expenses incurred during the wisconsin facility consolidation 
the latter costs have been partially mitigated due to improved operating efficiencies realized subsequent to the consolidation of the two plants 
income from operations was  or of net sales in fiscal compared to  or and  or of net sales in fiscal and management is pleased with the progress the company has made in fiscal to improve the level of income from operations in relation to current sales volumes 
the company continues to face industry challenges but will strive to obtain the same satisfactory results which were obtained between fiscal and by mitigating the effect of resin price increases  maintaining consistent levels of selling  general and administrative and expanding marketshare of its products 
interest expense decreased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease is attributed to reductions in the company s overall debt structure during the first half of fiscal coupled with stable interest rates during the majority of the year and the company s extensive use of optional bank libor interest rates 
during later part of fiscal  the company made significant machinery and equipment purchases and purchased a acre facility in commerce city  colorado to expand and relocate its colorado operations 
these expenditures set the stage for the company s future growth and were funded by operating cashflows and the issuance of additional bank financing 
the later has increased the company s overall debt structure by approximately  at fiscal year end and will result in additional interest costs in fiscal interest expense decreased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease is attributed to a overall reduction in the company s debt structure of approximately million as of june  coupled with last years renegotiated interest rates and reductions in the bank s prime lending interest rate which lowered interest rates by 
income before income taxes remained relatively consistent at  or 
per common share in fiscal compared to  or 
per common share in fiscal although consistent with prior year  the company s results included costs of  or 
per common share related to litigation settlement expenses see note of notes to financial statements 
total litigation costs represent an out of court settlement of  plus additional related legal costs of  income before income taxes decreased  to  or 
per common share in fiscal compared to  or 
per common share in fiscal the decrease is due to slightly lower sales volumes during the current fiscal year coupled with the resin cost increase and increases in selling  general and administrative expenses outlined above 
although operating results were below prior years levels  management feels the current year s results were satisfactory when one considers the challenging events which plagued fiscal income tax expense was  or 
per common share for fiscal compared to  or 
per common share in fiscal since fiscal when the company depleted its federal valuation allowance reserve  the company s income tax provision has included a significant deferred tax component of  or 
per common share and  or 
per common share in fiscal and  respectively 
the company will continue to report a large deferred tax provision until such time that the company s nol s million at june  and corresponding deferred tax assets are fully utilized 
management also notes that the deferred tax provision does not result in current outlays of cashflows due to the utilization of its nol s 
these cashflow savings are then available to supplement funding of the company s expansion projects  pay common stock dividends and reduce outstanding debt 
income tax expense was  or 
per common share for fiscal compared to income tax benefits of  for fiscal the increase is due to the recognition of deferred income taxes during fiscal which in prior years were minimized by the reversal of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
during fiscal  the company depleted the remaining  valuation allowance reserve based on management s continuing assessment and belief that the company will continue to utilize its nol s in the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources working capital decreased  to  at june  compared to  at june  the decrease was primarily due to reductions in accounts receivable and current deferred tax assets and an increase in accounts payable  net of decreases in accrued liabilities and an increase in inventories 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to improvements in the company s days sales outstanding in fiscal the increases in inventories and accounts payable are primarily due to the higher transaction levels related to increased sales volumes and also to raw material purchasing strategies initiated at fiscal year end 
cash provided by operations was  for fiscal which was consistent with fiscal results of  the main source of funds were net income and non cash expense items including depreciation  amortization and deferred income taxes 
the company expended a total of  for property  plant and equipment during fiscal compared to  for fiscal this reflects an increase of  over prior period expenditures 
the increase is partially attributed to the purchase of the commerce city  colorado facility in february the facility consists of acres of land and  sq 
feet of manufacturing and office building space 
the facility was purchased for  and to date the company has expended an additional  on building and facility improvements 
management anticipates spending an additional  in fiscal to complete the project 
in january  we also completed a  sq 
foot facility expansion at our texas facility 
the company spent approximately  on this expansion project 
fiscal has also been a record period for machinery and equipment acquisitions 
the company added six additional roto molding machines and five automated routers to its manufacturing operations 
since the merger  management has been very committed to expanding and improving its operations 
this commitment has allowed the company to stay in the forefront of the industry and optimizes our position for future growth 
in march and june  the company borrowed  and  respectively against its machinery and equipment term loan commitments 
the proceeds were used to pay down the company s revolving line of credit which had been used to temporarily finance approximately million in machinery and equipment purchases 
the notes are each due in sixty monthly principal installments plus interest at the bank s prime or optional libor interest rates 
in addition  the company received an additional million machinery and equipment term loan commitment from the bank for the financing of future capital expenditures 
in july  the company renewed its million secured line of credit with the bank which extended its maturity date to july  net borrowings under the line of credit increased  to  between june  and june  current increases in the line are primarily related to ongoing capital expenditures  including the building improvement in commerce city  until such time these costs are refinanced under long term debt arrangements 
the company s financial position continues to strengthen 
stockholder s equity increased  to  in fiscal and since fiscal stockholder s equity has more than doubled 
this increase is net of the company s second annual common stock dividend of
