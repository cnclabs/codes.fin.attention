overview founded in as a successor to a company that opened its first store in  piercing pagoda operated kiosk stores and in line stores in regional malls in states and puerto rico as of may  prior to fiscal  the company expanded primarily through new store openings 
since the beginning of fiscal through may   the company has acquired an aggregate of stores 
in fiscal  the company acquired kiosks and in line stores previously operated by earring tree  inc  which was then in bankruptcy the earring tree acquisition 
in january and april  the company solidified its position as the largest operator of gold jewelry kiosk stores by acquiring and kiosk stores  respectively  from the companies that had been the second and third largest gold jewelry kiosk operators 
the stores purchased in both of these acquisitions were generally comparable in size to the company s other stores and sold similar merchandise 
these acquisitions included the leases  kiosks  fixtures and inventory of the acquired stores 
the purchase prices paid in connection with the january acquisition from gemstone jewelry  inc  and a related company the gemstone acquisition  and the april acquisition from the silver gold trading company  inc the silver gold acquisition  were approximately million and million  respectively subject to certain post closing adjustments relating primarily to the cost of inventory  of which million and million  respectively  was paid for inventory at the respective sellers cost 
in addition  the company agreed to pay  per year for five years to induce the principal stockholder of each seller to enter into a non competition agreement 
because these acquisitions included the two largest gold jewelry kiosk store operators other than the company  the company does not expect to maintain the rate of recent store acquisitions 
accordingly  the rate of the company s net sales growth is likely to moderate beginning in fiscal and moderate further in fiscal the company plans to increase the net sales and store contribution of the acquired stores to more closely approximate the productivity of the company s average comparable store  in net sales in fiscal by revising and managing the product mix of the acquired stores to reflect the company s merchandising strategy  and by retraining sales associates and store management personnel to provide the level of customer service emphasized in the company s other stores and to improve operational efficiencies 
the company also believes that these acquisitions have the potential over the longer term to increase the company s profitability by spreading overhead over a significantly larger store base 
based on information provided by the respective sellers  the average net sales of the stores acquired in the gemstone acquisition for the twelve months ended december  were approximately  and the average net sales of the stores acquired in the silver gold acquisition for the twelve months ended january  were approximately  the company believes that the gemstone acquisition and the silver gold acquisition provide the company with many attractive store locations and that the company s plan to convert the acquired stores to the company s format and to implement the company s merchandising strategies will result in increased net sales and profitability in the acquired stores 
the company believes that its substantial experience in opening new stores and recent experience in integrating the stores acquired in the earring tree acquisition will facilitate the integration of the acquired stores 
however  there is no assurance that the company will successfully integrate the acquired stores and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
because a large number of recently acquired and newly opened stores  which generally have lower net sales volumes than the company s other stores  will be entering into the base for the computation of comparable store information during the current and future fiscal years  average net sales per comparable store and average comparable store net sales per square foot may decrease in the future  even if the company experiences increases in total and comparable store net sales 
the rate of the company s expansion and net sales growth may also be adversely affected to the extent that an independent store operator that is a licensee of the company the florida licensee exercises its right to purchase any or all of the company s stores in florida 
see properties and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
because the company sells merchandise to the florida licensee and receives a royalty from it  the company does not believe that its net income is likely to be materially adversely affected by any such purchases 
as part of its ongoing operations  the company continually evaluates the performance of its stores and the malls in which they are located 
since kiosks require a relatively low investment to open and can be moved relatively easily  the company s expansion philosophy includes closing stores where appropriate and using the kiosks  when possible  to open stores in new locations 
during the past three fiscal years  the company has closed stores and expects to close an aggregate of approximately stores during fiscal and fiscal net sales are comprised primarily of sales generated by stores and  to a much lesser extent  wholesale sales primarily to the florida licensee

cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses include the cost of merchandise  rent and other occupancy expenses and the cost of preparing merchandise for sale 
selling  general and administrative expenses include store and supervisory payroll  corporate overhead and non occupancy store expenses  including depreciation on kiosks

see notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal and fiscal  the company was taxed as a c corporation in all jurisdictions 
pro forma net income is computed as if the company were subject to federal and all applicable state corporate income taxes 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal net sales net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to net sales generated by new stores opened or acquired by the company and to a million  or  increase in comparable store net sales 
at march   the company operated stores compared to stores at march  the average jewelry units sold per comparable store increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal partially due to an increase in the number of promotional events at the company s stores versus the prior year 
the average price per jewelry unit sold for all the company s stores also increased modestly by  or  to in fiscal from in fiscal wholesale sales primarily to the florida licensee increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal to support the increased retail sales of the florida licensee including sales at one additional location purchased from the company during fiscal gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while gross profit margin increased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit margin increased due to higher mark ups associated with lower costs of merchandise during the period  offset by an increase in promotional events held by the company during fiscal versus fiscal the remaining improvement in gross margin primarily reflects an improvement in rent and other occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales  reflecting the leverage of a larger sales base 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales primarily reflects higher expenses associated with new stores opened and acquired by the company 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to capital expenditures for new stores and the upgrading of kiosks in existing locations 
interest expense interest expense increased  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and as a percentage of net sales  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in interest expense  which includes interest paid on bank borrowings  fees paid for letters of credit as part of the company s gold consignment program and gold consignment fees  primarily reflects an increase in the company s total average borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit and an increase in the number of ounces consigned under the company s gold consignment program 
in addition  million of long term debt related to the company s fiscal expansion of its corporate headquarters and distribution center was outstanding since the end of the first quarter of fiscal income tax expense income tax expense increased  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  income tax expense decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in income tax expense is due to the increase in the company s earnings before income taxes 
the decrease in income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes reflects the full year effect of certain tax planning strategies implemented during fiscal net income the company s net income increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company believes that such increase resulted from the foregoing factors  among other things 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal net sales net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of stores open in fiscal as compared to fiscal and to a million  or  increase in comparable store net sales 
at march   the company was operating stores versus at the end of the prior fiscal year 
the average jewelry units sold per comparable store increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the average price per jewelry unit sold for all of the company s stores increased modestly by  or  to in fiscal from in fiscal wholesale sales primarily to the florida licensee increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal to support the increased retail sales of the florida licensee  including sales at one additional location purchased from the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  while gross profit margin increased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal the gross profit margin increase primarily reflects a slight improvement in rent expense as a percentage of net sales  reflecting the leverage of a larger sales base 
also contributing to the increase in gross margin was a reduction in wholesale sales as a percentage of total net sales of the company 
wholesale sales provide a lower gross margin than the company s own retail net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales primarily reflects higher expenses associated with new store growth  an increase in staffing hours at the company s stores and an improved incentive package for store personnel implemented in the third quarter of fiscal depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to capital expenditures for new stores and the upgrading of kiosks in existing locations 
interest expense interest expense decreased  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in interest expense  which includes interest paid on bank borrowings  fees paid for letters of credit as part of the company s gold consignment program and gold consignment rates  was due primarily to a decrease in the company s total average borrowings  including a million stockholder note payable which was outstanding during fiscal and not during fiscal  and a reduction in the average interest rate charged on the company s revolving line of credit 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in number of ounces consigned under the company s gold consignment program 
income tax expense income tax expense increased  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  income tax expense decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in income tax expense is due to the increase in the company s earnings before income taxes

net income the company s net income increased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company believes that such increase resulted from the foregoing factors  among other things 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary ongoing short term capital requirements have been to fund an increase in inventory and to fund capital expenditures and working capital mostly inventory for new and acquired stores 
the company s long term liquidity requirements relate principally to the maturity of its long term debt in july of  operating lease commitments and store expansion 
the company s primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided from operations  a gold consignment program and bank borrowings 
the company had working capital of million and million at the end of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
see seasonality 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in fiscal  while net cash used in operating activities amounted to  in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal primarily reflects net earnings plus depreciation  partially offset by increases in working capital requirements  including increases in inventory to support new and acquired store growth 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal primarily reflects increases in inventory to support growth in new and acquired stores  partially offset by increases in net earnings and depreciation 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these amounts reflect million and million of capital expenditures related to new and acquired store expansion and the company s investment in management information systems in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
additionally  in fiscal  the company paid million for the acquisition of locations in the gemstone acquisition 
in fiscal  the company acquired store locations in the earring tree acquisition for approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily reflects an increase of million under the company s revolving line of credit and  of long term industrial development authority financing 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal reflects an increase of million in borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit and million of long term industrial development authority financing 
during fiscal  the company renegotiated its existing unsecured revolving line of credit with its primary lender acting as agent for a syndicate of banks 
the new facility  which expires july   provides for maximum borrowings of million through a combination of cash advances which may not exceed million and letters of credit which may not exceed million to support the company s gold consignment financing program 
amounts borrowed under the facility generally accrue interest at the higher of i the prime rate of the company s primary lender minus basis points at march  or ii a rate based on overnight federal funds transactions with federal reserve system members plus basis points at march   however  the company may elect to have all or any portion of the outstanding balance under the facility accrue interest at a rate based on one  two  three or six month libor plus basis points at march  for a one month maturity  subject to certain restrictions 
fees are paid on letters of credit based on amounts outstanding at an annual rate of 
at march   the company had million available for cash borrowings under this revolving credit facility 
letters of credit in the amounts of approximately million and approximately million were issued at march  and  respectively 
the loan agreement contains various covenants which  among other things  limit certain corporate acts of the company such as mergers and acquisitions  require the company to maintain minimum ratios of indebtedness to equity  current assets to current liabilities and cash flow as defined to debt service  place limitations on the company s ability to incur additional debt or grant security interests in its assets  and restrict the redemption  purchase or retirement of its capital stock 
the company utilizes gold consignment arrangements which allow the company to finance its gold merchandise at rates which are less than its traditional bank borrowing rates 
under the consignment arrangements  the company generally sells to a consignor the gold content of the merchandise which it owns and simultaneously has the gold consigned back to the company 
the jewelry containing the consigned gold is commingled with the gold jewelry owned by the company 
the company s obligation to the consignors is based upon the price of gold at the time of the sale by the company of the consigned gold and  therefore  is subject to fluctuation based on changes in the market value of gold 
if the gold ounces in merchandise held for sale by the company is about to be reduced below the amount of gold consigned  the company either repurchases the gold from a consignor or purchases additional gold jewelry from suppliers to support the amount of consigned gold 
in the event the price of gold at the time of such repurchases or purchases is greater than the price at the time the gold was originally sold to the consignor  the company s gross profit margin will be decreased 
the company does not engage  and currently has no plans to engage  in hedging transactions to protect against fluctuations in the market value of gold or to lock in prices for future purchases 
the company does  however  manage the amount of gold consigned in relation to its total merchandise available for sale in order to provide the company with the flexibility to consign or repurchase gold according to seasonal fluctuations in merchandise levels and sales 
during fiscal and fiscal  average financing costs under the consignment agreements were approximately and per annum  respectively  of the market value of the gold held under consignment 
additionally  the current consignment agreements require a letter of credit to support the market value of the gold consigned to the company 
the financing cost to the company of the consignment program is substantially less than the cost that would have been incurred if the company financed the purchase of all of its gold requirements with borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
the company s current gold consignment arrangements are terminable by either party upon either or days notice  depending on the consignor 
gold consignment programs are common in the gold jewelry industry and the company believes that  if the institutions with which it currently has gold consignment agreements were to terminate such agreements  it would have a number of opportunities to establish gold consignment programs with terms similar to its current arrangements 
during the last two fiscal years  the company has financed an average of approximately of the gold content of its merchandise under the consignment program 
as of march   the amount of gold consigned was  ounces with a value of million versus  ounces with a value of million at march  the consigned gold is not included in inventory on the company s balance sheet and  therefore  there is no related liability recorded 
if the market value of gold increases  assuming the number of ounces consigned remain constant  the financing costs incurred by the company which are included in interest expense  and the repayment obligations to the consignors under the consignment arrangements  will increase in proportion to the increase in the market value of gold 
additionally  the amount of the letters of credit would need to be increased to support the increased market value of the consigned gold  thereby reducing the amount which might otherwise be available for cash borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company anticipates capital expenditures in fiscal to total approximately million  of which approximately million is related primarily to the construction of new stores and the renovation of existing stores  and approximately million is related to the construction of a new warehouse and distribution facility  the implementation of new inventory management and replenishment software  additional computer hardware associated with this software and the upgrading of its financial and accounting systems 
the company currently anticipates opening approximately to new stores in fiscal  excluding any potential acquisitions 
opening a new store generally requires a total investment of approximately  including approximately  of inventory a portion of which is generally financed through consignment arrangements   for construction of the kiosk  fixtures  point of sale register and other equipment and supplies and  for pre opening expenses which are expensed when incurred 
the company believes that the expected net cash provided by operating activities  its gold consignment program  bank borrowings under its revolving line of credit facility and the net proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to fund the company s currently anticipated capital and liquidity needs 
seasonality the company s business is highly seasonal 
due to the impact of the holiday shopping season  the company experiences a substantial portion of its total net sales and profitability in its third fiscal quarter ending december st  and during the last two fiscal years  the month of december  on average  has accounted for approximately of the company s annual net sales and of its annual income from operations 
the company has generally experienced lower net sales in each of the first  second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year  and lower net income or net losses in each of those quarters 
quarterly data set forth below is certain summary information with respect to the company s operations for the most recent eight fiscal quarters fiscal fiscal st nd rd th st nd rd quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter in thousands  except per share data statement of income data net sales        gross profit        selling  general and administrative expenses        income loss from operations   net income loss   earnings loss per share comparable store net sales increase as a percentage of net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income loss from operations net income loss fiscal th quarter statement of income data net sales  gross profit  selling  general and administrative expenses  income loss from operations net income loss earnings loss per share comparable store net sales increase as a percentage of net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income loss from operations net income loss gross profit excludes depreciation on kiosks 
depreciation on kiosks is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
if for any reason the company s net sales were below those normally expected for the third fiscal quarter  and  in particular  the month of december  the company s annual financial results would be materially adversely affected 
the seasonality of the company s business puts a significant demand on working capital resources to provide for a build up of merchandise for the holiday season 
historically  the company s working capital requirement is at its lowest level in january  increases steadily through the end of november  when it reaches its highest level  and declines rapidly through the holiday season 
the company s results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors  including fluctuations in the price of gold  the amount and timing of acquisitions and new store openings  the integration of recently acquired and newly opened stores into the operations of the company  the timing of promotions  fluctuations in the price of gold  and changes in national and regional economic conditions 
for example  earnings from operations in the first  second and fourth quarters of fiscal were adversely affected by the integration and assimilation of stores opened or acquired during fiscal and fiscal this was due primarily to the relatively fixed nature of rent and other occupancy costs and selling  general and administrative costs associated with the recently acquired and newly opened stores  which had a significant adverse impact on these lower net sales volume quarters 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting the relatively moderate levels of inflation which have been experienced in the united states 
the company s leases for stores typically provide for a percentage rent based on store sales and  therefore  to the extent retail prices increase  there may be an increase in occupancy costs 
generally  the company prices its gold merchandise based on the price it paid suppliers for the merchandise and does not reprice the items based upon normal fluctuations in the price of gold 
while inflation has not had a material impact upon operating results  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncement in february   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 earnings per share sfas no 

this statement establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share eps and simplifies the standards for computing eps previously found in apb opinion no 
 earnings per share 
it replaces the presentation of primary earnings per share with the presentation of basic eps 
it also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted eps on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
during the quarter ended december  the company has not completed its evaluation of the potential impact of the new standard on eps 
however  based on equity instruments currently outstanding under existing stock compensations plans  the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s eps
