item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and selected financial data of the company included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general in fiscal  the company again achieved new highs in net sales and earnings 
operating results for the year reflect full year inclusion of uson  acquired in february  metrix  acquired in september  and five months results of gatan and fmi  both acquired in may  as well as the benefits of sales growth experienced by most businesses  particularly ccc 
the significant acquisitions of gatan and fmi in cost a combined million of which million was in cash  million was through the issuance of common stock  and million is to be funded in future years 
strong operating cash flow provided million 
as a result  the company s revolving line of credit increased by million over the year 
with this report  the company is changing its segment reporting to recognize the critical mass of the analytical instrumentation businesses following the acquisition of gatan and the recent change in management structure along these new segment lines 
isl and uson had previously been reported within the industrial controls segment and are now reported within the new analytical instrumentation segment along with gatan 
finally  fmi is reported within the fluid handling segment 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the years indicated  the percentages of the company s net sales that certain income and expense items represent 
year ended october  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense other income earnings before income taxes and accounting changes income taxes earnings before accounting changes segment data presented below in thousands reflect the company s commencement of reporting in three segments as noted above 
data for the year ended october  has been restated to reflect the three segments  however  data for the year ended october  is presented as previously reported in two segments since the only analytical instrumentation business owned during that year  isl  was held for less than one quarter and it s inclusion in the industrial controls segment for that year was immaterial 
year ended october  industrial controls segment  net sales    gross profit    operating profit    fluid handling segment net sales    gross profit    operating profit    analytical instrumentation segment  net sales   gross profit   operating profit   includes results of isl from august  to october  includes results of metrix from september  operating profit is income from operations excluding any allocation of corporate administrative costs  investment income or interest expense 
corporate costs were  in   in and  in includes results of fmi from may  includes results of isl from november  includes results of uson from february  includes results of gatan from june  year ended october  compared to year ended october  net sales for of million were at record levels for the fourth consecutive year  reflecting an increase of over each of the company s business segments achieved double digit sales growth 
for the industrial controls segment net sales increased by million  or 
a increase in net sales from ccc  despite a modest increase in its business with russian gazprom  and the inclusion of metrix for a full year  were the primary contributors to the increase 
the ccc sales gains included the first significant orders shipped to customers other than russian gazprom in the commonwealth of independent states cis following establishment of a significant local infrastructure 
also  ccc made significant gains in other international markets for processing plant compressor controls 
other contributors to sales gains within the industrial controls segment included favorable market conditions in certain of the core markets and incremental sales on new products 
the fluid handling segment experienced net sales gains of million  or  with the inclusion of fmi for five months and the continued growth from cornell and integrated designs 
this offset a decline in roper pump s net sales resulting from weak demand in the early quarters for rotary gear and progressive cavity pumps 
record first half sales at integrated designs were eroded by lower third and fourth quarter sales as a result of a cyclical decline in the semiconductor industry  but still showed a full year growth of from continued international market gains  particularly in asia 
the analytical instrumentation segment reported net sales increases of million  or  with the inclusion of gatan for five months and net sales gains at the other two businesses 
these sales gains were principally attributable to incremental sales on new products  expansion into the medical supplies testing market and international market expansion 
in  net sales to customers outside the united states represented of the total as compared to in the leading reasons for international sales growth were the acquisition of gatan which made of its sales outside the united states and increasing penetration of european and pacific rim markets through the existing roper infrastructure 
results of foreign operations were not significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in gross profit of million in increased by million over the same period last year  while the gross margin decreased to from for this margin reduction was contributed to by similar margin impacts from both industrial controls and fluid handling segments as offset by improved margins in the analytical instrumentation segment 
the gross margin for the industrial controls segment declined to from 
this was largely attributable to more low margin  buy out products sold to russian gazprom and increased engineering and infrastructure costs supporting ccc s operations in the cis 
the gross margin for the fluid handling segment declined to versus in  primarily due to lower margins at integrated designs caused by increased discounted sales to oem s and vendor price increases 
the margins at integrated designs returned close to historical levels for the last month of the fiscal year 
gross margins for the analytical instrumentation segment increased to from in reflecting the higher margin rates from the acquisition of gatan and margin improvements at isl and uson  both of which benefited from the leverage of additional volume  cost reduction efforts and price increases on products sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a increased by million to million  an increase of 
s  g a as a percentage of net sales reduced to from in this reduction is attributable to the industrial controls segment where s  g a expenses reduced to of sales in  from in  and was principally the result of lower r d costs at ccc where the series design was stabilized and from reduced bonus compensation in research and development expenses were million in  an increase of million  reflecting the increased investment required in higher technology products throughout the company 
income from operations increased by million to million 
the operating margin declined to versus in the prior year 
in the industrial controls segment  operating profit before allocation of corporate administrative expenses increased by million to million  of sales  principally due to increased sales at ccc and the full year inclusion of metrix results 
operating profits before allocation of corporate administrative expenses of the fluid handling segment increased by million to million  of sales  with the inclusion of fmi offsetting margin related declines at integrated designs and volume related declines at roper pump 
the analytical instrumentation segment increased operating profits by to million  of sales  largely as a result of the acquisition of gatan 
interest expense increased by million  or  due to the additional borrowings for the acquisitions 
the decrease in other income results from lower royalties collected under a license fee agreement 
the company s effective tax rate was versus in the effective tax rate was reduced from the statutory rate largely because of the favorable tax treatment afforded export sales attributed to its foreign sales corporation fsc and a lower state tax burden 
reflecting the foregoing  net earnings were million or per common share as compared to million or per common share for bookings for increased by to million pro forma to include gatan  fmi  metrix and uson for 
sales order backlog was million and million at october  and  respectively  reflecting a increase in pro forma bookings in the fourth quarter 
this increase in bookings included a number of orders which totaled million from ukrainian gazprom 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  net sales for of million were at record levels for the third consecutive year  reflecting an increase of over the fluid handling and newly created analytical instrumentation business segments achieved net sales gains offsetting a decline in the industrial controls segment 
net sales of core businesses  excluding sales to russian gazprom  increased by 
for the industrial controls segment  net sales decreased by million  or  driven by a million year over year decline in sales to russian gazprom 
the lower level of revenues from gazprom reflected continued difficulties in arranging current financing 
offsetting sales gains within the industrial controls segment included favorable market conditions in certain of the core markets  increased sales activities  and incremental sales on new products 
shipments by amot under a large order to supply hazardous area control systems also contributed to the sales gains in this segment 
one area of weakness was the reduction in the demand for gas compression systems in the canadian market 
the fluid handling segment experienced net sales gains of million or  as this segment continues to benefit from strong demand for integrated designs products 
integrated designs net sales grew at a faster rate than the market it serves 
the remaining net sales gains in this segment were principally attributable to improved sales levels in select core markets  price increases and incremental sales on new products 
sales for the analytical instrumentation segment of million reflected the full year of sales at isl and seven months of sales from uson 
in  net sales to customers outside the united states represented of the total as compared to in this decline was largely attributable to the lower level of russian gazprom sales 
the company s foreign operations recorded net sales of million in and million in inclusion of isl for a full year as compared to only two months in was the leading reason for the growth in foreign operations 
results of foreign operations were not significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during gross profit of million in increased by million over the same period last year 
the gross margin also increased to  as compared to for  from the higher margins of the new analytical instrumentation segment and from gains in the fluid handling segment 
the gross margin for the industrial controls segment declined from to  impacted by the lower year over year russian gazprom sales 
the gross margin for the fluid handling segment increased to versus for  reflecting the increasing contribution of integrated designs and improvements in gross margins at the other business units in this segment 
integrated designs gross margin was also substantially higher than the other businesses within the fluid handling segment 
gross margins also benefited from favorable product mix  cost reduction efforts  and price increases on products sold 
s  g a increased by million to million  an increase of 
s  g a as a percentage of net sales was in and in inclusion of isl and uson in the current year accounted for the majority of this increase 
other factors contributing to the growth in s  g a included an increase at integrated designs principally due to higher commission costs and increased personnel and related costs to support its sales growth  an increase in compensation expense of 
million associated with the incentive stock bonus plan for certain key executives at one of the subsidiary companies  and a 
million increase in amortization expense substantially related to goodwill on the most recent acquisitions 
the compensation expense recognized under the incentive stock bonus plan was higher as a result of an increase in the market value of the company s stock as compared to the prior year 
the number of shares of company stock earned in under the incentive plan was the same as in these increases were offset by reduced commission expense at ccc  resulting from lower gazprom sales and a higher percentage of sales handled on a direct sales basis 
research and development expenses were million in  an increase of million over  principally attributable to the inclusion of isl for a full year and uson since its acquisition 
income from operations increased by million to million 
the operating margin declined to versus in the prior year 
in the industrial controls segment  operating profit before allocation of corporate administrative expenses declined by million to million or of net sales  principally due to reduced sales to russian gazprom 
for the fluid handling segment  operating profit before allocation of corporate administrative expenses increased by million to million  or of net sales 
sales gains by integrated designs and improved gross margins and cost reduction efforts at the other business units in that segment accounted for the increase in operating profit 
the analytical instrumentation segment operating profits of million  or of net sales  reflect the acquisition of uson and the full year contribution of isl 
interest expense increased by 
million  or  due to additional borrowings for the latest acquisitions and rising interest rates 
the increase in other income is mostly due to royalties collected under a license fee agreement 
the company s effective tax rate was versus for the effective tax rate was reduced from the statutory rate largely because of the favorable tax treatment afforded export sales attributed to the fsc 
the increase in the effective tax rate as compared to the prior year reflects a lower tax benefit associated with foreign sales and a higher state tax burden 
net earnings were million or per common share as compared to million or per common share for the previous year results included the cumulative effect of accounting changes for income taxes sfas no 
and post retirement medical benefits sfas no 
 reducing net earnings by 
million  or 
per common share 
bookings for increased by to million pro forma to include isl  uson and metrix for 
incoming orders for the core businesses excluding russian gazprom increased by million to million  an increase of 
sales order backlog was million and million at october  and  respectively 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations and credit available under its principal bank credit agreement are the company s primary sources of short term liquidity 
in  the company generated million in cash from operations  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increased operating cash flow in principally resulted from operating profits which also included higher levels of noncash expenditures for depreciation and amortization attributable to various acquisitions 
these cash flows were offset with investments in working capital associated with net sales increases 
moreover  working capital turns increased from times to times over the year 
capital expenditures in were million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
this increase reflects the growth in the number of operations 
management believes that it can absorb anticipated sales growth without any significant expansion in manufacturing facilities  that capital requirements will generally be confined to ongoing replacement and upgrading of current machinery and facilities  and that the total costs of such expenditures in are not currently expected to materially exceed levels 
the increase in intangibles and other assets reflects the million in goodwill recognized on the current year acquisitions 
total stockholders equity increased by million to million  an increase of 
major components of this increase include current year net earnings of million  million of roper stock issued as part of the purchase price for fmi  million of stock options exercised  million of issued stock grants accrued for in prior years  less million of cash dividends 
in may of  the company renegotiated its principal bank credit agreement  raising the borrowing capacity to million  up from million 
the company s domestic credit facilities are secured by substantially all of its us assets  including receivables and inventories  and are guaranteed by its subsidiaries 
total long term debt was million at october   compared to million as of the prior year end 
this increase in long term debt in fiscal resulted from financing the acquisitions of gatan and fmi 
to finance these acquisitions  the company borrowed million under its revolving line of credit 
long term debt to total capitalization was and at october  and  respectively  indicating a relatively modest level of financial leverage 
at october  the company had million of available credit under the credit agreement  the material terms and conditions of which are set out in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the company s borrowings under its principal bank credit agreement are at variable interest rates 
interest costs are therefore subject to significant changes depending upon the movement of short term interest rates and other factors 
the company believes that internally generated cash flow and available unused lines of credit will continue to be adequate to fund normal operating requirements 
however  the rate at which the company can reduce its debt in and the avoidance of associated interest expense will be significantly affected both by the timing of shipments to russian gazprom and the financing requirements of any new acquisitions 
the company has generally been able to hold manufacturing and operating cost increases to levels which are at or below inflation levels 
it will continue its aggressive efforts to minimize increases in the prices it pays for materials and services and to implement cost reduction programs to offset the effects of inflation 
the company expects to continue to be successful in passing along any net cost increases to its customers 
outlook incoming orders at fiscal year end were strong  as noted above  and the company expects its three business segments to continue their growth in sales and earnings absent any material adverse change in the market and business conditions 
a cyclical downturn in the semi conductor capital markets will likely have an adverse impact on the sales of integrated designs as compared to sales levels 
the company s business with russian gazprom is anticipated to become more even and predictable in the event of finalization of us export import guaranteed financing for million of sales over the next five years 
however  the timing of shipments for gazprom s pipeline project will continue to be affected by a host of other factors including weather  russian gazprom s own involvement in the installation and start up and political developments in russia  all of which could greatly influence the pace of this project and are beyond ccc s control 
the company believes russian gazprom remains strongly committed to pipeline projects for which it has already purchased approximately million of control systems and engineering services from ccc 
the company believes it is positioned and financially able to continue its acquisition strategy and expects to identify and review acquisition candidates throughout item changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure
