to facilitate the discussion of the corporation s results of operations  table presents an additional analysis of performance to supplement the accompanying consolidated statements of income and balance sheets 
this additional analysis should not be viewed as a substitute for the financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which are included elsewhere in this report 
there are two primary differences between the consolidated statements of income and the operating income analysis that is presented in table first  certain non recurring transactions are not included in noninterest expenses in determining operating income 
second  due to the format of table  not all line items agree directly to the consolidated financial statements 
management has presented the additional analysis in the belief that it is meaningful to understand the results and trends in operating income separately from non recurring transactions 
results of operations operating income  defined as income before non recurring items  increased in as compared to operating income per share was in versus s 
over the past three years  the corporation has experienced significant non recurring items which are described below during  the corporation experienced two non recurring items 
first  the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic assessed a special one time levy the fdic special assessment to recapitalize the savings association insurance fund the saif which resulted in a special assessment of million for ccb in the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  ccb protested the amount of special assessment levied on certain portions of the saif deposit base and received a million reduction in the assessment 
ccb s saif deposits resulted from its acquisitions of thrift institutions in through second  through congressional legislative action  the recapture of tax bad debt reserves required upon a savings bank s conversion to a commercial bank was forgiven 
consequently  a million tax benefit was recorded in the third quarter prior to graham s merger into ccb the recapture tax benefit 
as previously discussed  the corporation merged with security capital in to effect the transaction  the corporation incurred million of merger related expense which included severance and other employee benefit costs  costs related to branch closures  system conversion costs and other transaction related expenses 
in addition  million of expense was incurred in to effect security capital s acquisition of first federal collectively merger related expense 
the after tax effect of the merger related expense was million for and  for also in  security capital recognized a one time charge of million for the recapture of tax bad debt reserves which was recorded in anticipation of the mergers of its savings bank subsidiaries into its commercial bank subsidiary the recapture tax charge

in  the corporation realized net taxable equivalent interest income of million 
average earning asset increases of million in were due to a full year s ownership of first federal s assets and internal growth 
changes in the mix of earning assets toward higher earning loans and lease financing did not fully offset the rise in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities with the result that the net interest margin fell basis points in from s level 
the increased rate paid for interest bearing liabilities followed earlier increases in rates earned on interest earning assets as  generally  increases in interest rates affect a large percentage of the corporation s interest earning assets immediately while the interest bearing liabilities reprice as they mature in subsequent months 
consequently  the interest rate spread fell to in from s 
the contribution of free liabilities to the net interest margin rose to basis points in from basis points in the overall increase in net interest income of million was due to increases in volume of million offset by decreases in rate of million 
growth in the average earning asset base in the previous three years has primarily occurred in the loans and lease financing portfolio and federal funds sold and other short term investments 
following a trend begun in  the mix in earning assets continued to shift toward loans and lease financing due to increased loan demand 
loans and lease financing comprised of average earning assets in compared to in other than the first federal acquisition in  expansion of the earning asset base during the periods presented has been funded primarily with increases in the deposit base and the retention of earnings

impairment of the recorded msr is measured periodically using a current fair value applied to each stratum of the disaggregated mortgage servicing portfolio

table shows the year end breakdown of the major categories of the loans and lease financing portfolio for the previous five years based upon regulatory classifications 
outstanding loans and lease financing increased million over s total 
the loan mix at year end varies from the loan mix at december  primarily due to the mid year reclassification of certain loans from commercial  financial and agricultural loans to real estate mortgage million and real estate construction million 
due to system limitations  loans that were misclassified in prior periods have not been restated for their correct classification 
all of the loan growth was internally generated 
substantially all loans are made on a secured basis with the exception of credit card receivables and  with the exception of marketable mortgage loans  are originated for retention in the subsidiary banks portfolios 
in general  the subsidiary banks do not purchase loans or participate with others in the origination of loans and confine their lending activities to north carolina except for credit card receivables which are offered on a nationwide basis and automobile loans which are offered in georgia and virginia through referrals from a major automobile insurance company 
lending officers of the subsidiary banks generally consider the cash flow or earnings power of the borrower as the primary source of repayment

loans in the commercial  financial and agricultural category consist primarily of short term and or floating rate commercial loans made to medium sized companies 
there is no substantial loan concentration in any one industry or to any one borrower 
real estate construction loans are primarily made to commercial developers and residential contractors on a floating rate basis 
cash flow analyses for each project are the primary decision factor  with additional reliance upon collateral values

it is the subsidiary banks general policy to retain adjustable rate first mortgage loans within the portfolio 
the remaining portion of real estate mortgage loans are primarily for commercial purposes and often include the commercial borrower s real property in addition to other collateral 
management anticipates moderate growth in this category for instalment loans to individuals consist primarily of loans secured by automobiles and other consumer personal property 
lending officers consider the customer s debt obligations  ability and willingness to repay and general economic trends in their decision to extend credit 
since  the corporation has had an alliance with a major automobile insurance company  which  through referrals from the insurance company  has increased the amount of automobile loans outstanding 
during  ccb signed an agreement to extend the market area for loan referrals from the automobile insurance company into virginia 
credit card products include overdraft protection and traditional credit card services 
the nationwide introduction of a new credit card product in  which has interest rates lower than many competitors  contributed to the increase in credit card balances outstanding from s level of million

the corporation does not currently anticipate selling a significant amount of the securities available for sale in the near future 
future fluctuations in shareholders equity may occur due to changes in the market values of debt and equity securities classified as available for sale

all other bank holding companies are expected to maintain a leverage capital ratio of at least to above the stated minimum 
the corporation and the subsidiary banks continue to maintain higher capital ratios than required under regulatory guidelines

unallocated portion of reserve  total  the allocation of the reserve for loan and lease losses by loan type is based on management s on going evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for loan and lease losses as referenced above 
since the factors involved in such evaluation are subject to change  the allocation of the reserve to the respective loan types is not necessarily indicative of future losses in each loan type 
additionally  no assurances can be made that the allocation shown will be indicative of future allocations 
loans are considered impaired if it is probable that the subsidiary banks will be unable to collect all amounts due under the terms of the loan agreement 
the value of the impaired loan is based on the present value of the impaired loan s expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  the observable market price of the impaired loan  or the fair value of the collateral for a collateral dependent loan 
any measurement losses are recognized through additions to the allowance for loan losses 
at december  and  impaired loans amounted to million and million  respectively 
the related reserve for loan and lease losses on these loans amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
management feels that the reserve for loan and lease losses is adequate to absorb known and inherent risks in the loans and lease financing portfolio 
a key tool in controlling loan losses is the corporation s loan grading system that begins at the inception of the credit relationship 
under this grading system  substantially all credit relationships greater than  excluding residential mortgage and home equity lines are assigned grades that direct the timing and intensity of loan review activity throughout the life of the relationship 
all significant relationships are reviewed at least annually 
relationships that have the lowest grade are reviewed each thirty days 
management periodically reviews the adequacy of the reserve through a model which incorporates the results of credit reviews  historical loss experience and other factors 
based on this review  the loan and lease loss reserve is adequate to cover known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the most recent regulatory agency examinations have not revealed any material problem credits that had not been previously identified  however  future regulatory examinations may result in the regulatory agencies requiring additions to the reserve for loan and lease losses based on information available at the examination date 
liquidity and interest sensitivity liquidity ensures that adequate funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals  fund loan and capital expenditure commitments  maintain reserve requirements  pay operating expenses  provide funds for dividends  debt service and other commitments and operate the organization on an ongoing basis 
funds are primarily provided by the subsidiary banks through financial resources from operating activities  expansion of the deposit base  borrowing funds in money market operations and through the sale or maturity of assets 
net cash provided by operating activities and deposits from customers have historically been primary sources of liquidity for the corporation 
net cash provided by operating activities amounted to approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
average total deposits have grown by million  million and million during the three previous years 
the majority of the deposit growth in was due to the first federal acquisition which had deposits of million as of the acquisition date 
average certificates of deposit in denominations of  or more still comprise a relatively small percentage of average total deposits  in versus in these deposits decreased on the average million from to management intentionally keeps the corporation s reliance on the higher cost large certificates of deposit low because of the availability of less expensive sources of funding and considers them a secondary source of liquidity that can be obtained as needed 
at december   time certificates of deposit in amounts of  or more were million compared to million at december  the following is a remaining maturity schedule of these deposits at december  in thousands over over through months through or less months months total jumbo deposits     the subsidiary banks do not rely heavily on borrowing funds in money market operations such as federal funds purchased or repurchase agreements to provide liquidity 
the subsidiary banks have historically been a net seller of federal funds and only rarely purchased federal funds to meet liquidity requirements 
correspondent relationships are maintained with several larger banks to be able to purchase federal funds when needed 
also available as liquidity sources are access to the federal reserve discount window and a million line of credit maintained with the federal home loan bank the fhlb which is secured by a blanket collateral agreement on ccb s mortgage loan portfolio 
the corporation s average short term investments  net of average short term borrowings  were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
outstanding long term fhlb advances decreased by million during to million 
the fhlb advances were drawn primarily to fund matched maturity loans 
maturities of securities held for investment and sales and maturities of securities categorized as available for sale are other sources of liquidity 
securities with carrying values of million mature in the available for sale portfolio is comprised of us treasury securities  obligations of us government agencies and corporations and equity securities 
securities available for sale will be considered in the corporation s asset liability management strategies and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  liquidity needs and or significant prepayment risk 
liquidity at the parent company level is provided through cash dividends from the subsidiary banks  the repayment of demand notes payable to the parent company from the subsidiary banks and the capacity of the parent company to raise additional funds as needed 
in addition to ensuring adequate liquidity  the corporation is concerned with the management of its balance sheet to maintain relatively stable net interest margins despite changes in the interest rate environment 
responsibility for both liquidity and interest sensitivity management rests with the corporation s asset liability management committee alco comprised of senior management 
alco reviews the corporation s interest rate and liquidity exposures and  based on its view of existing and expected market conditions  adopts balance sheet strategies that are intended to optimize net interest income to the extent possible while minimizing the risk associated with unanticipated changes in interest rates 
determining and monitoring the appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities and the impact on earnings of changes in interest rates is accomplished through alco s use of gap analysis and simulation analysis 
gap analysis measures the interest sensitivity of assets and liabilities at a given point in time 
the interest sensitivity of assets and liabilities is based on the timing of contractual maturities and repricing opportunities 
prepayments of loans and certain investment securities and early withdrawals of deposits represent options which may or may not be exercised 
due to the uncertain nature of prepayments and early withdrawals  alco has chosen to exclude them from consideration in the review of gap analysis 
a positive interest sensitive gap occurs when interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities 
the reverse situation results in a negative gap 
management feels that an essentially balanced position of total earning assets between interest sensitive assets and liabilities is necessary in order to protect against wide fluctuations in interest rates 
an analysis of the corporation s interest sensitivity position at december  is presented in table at december   the corporation had a cumulative negative gap interest sensitive liabilities exceeding interest sensitive assets of million or of total earning assets over a twelve month horizon 
the ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities was 
x 
gap analysis is a limited measurement tool  however  because it does not incorporate the interrelationships between interest rates charged or paid  balance sheet trends and management s reaction in response to interest rate changes 
in addition  a gap analysis model does not consider that changes in interest rates do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
therefore  alco uses gap analysis as a tool to monitor changes in the balance sheet structure 
to estimate the impact that changes in interest rates would have on the corporation s earnings  alco uses simulation analysis

the interest sensitivity position has meaning only as of the date for which it is prepared 
investment securities are presented at their amortized cost 
the mark to market adjustment of  for available for sale securities is not included 
simulation analysis is performed using a computer based asset liability model which incorporates current portfolio balances and rates  contractual maturities  repricing opportunities  and assumptions about prepayments  future interest rates  and future volumes 
using this information  the model calculates earnings estimates for the corporation under multiple interest rate scenarios 
to measure the sensitivity of the corporation s earnings  the results of multiple simulations  which assume changes in interest rates  are compared to the base case simulation  which assumes no changes in interest rates 
the sensitivity of earnings is expressed as a percentage change in comparison to the base case simulation 
as a matter of policy  alco has stated that the maximum negative impact to net income from a positive or negative change in interest rates over a month period should not exceed  which was achieved in alco actually manages earnings sensitivity  however  with a targeted goal of only a to impact on net income 
if simulation results show that earnings sensitivity exceeds the targeted limits  alco will adopt on balance sheet and or off balance sheet strategies to bring earnings sensitivity within target guidelines 
management uses both on and off balance sheet strategies to manage the balance sheet in accordance with their projected interest rate environment 
the most efficient and cost effective method of on balance sheet management is creating desired maturity and repricing streams through the strategic pricing of interest earning and interest bearing on balance sheet products 
alco reviews the interest earning and interest bearing portfolios to ensure that the corporation has a proper mix of fixed and variable rate products 
emphasis will continue to be placed on granting loans with short maturities and floating rates where possible 
this strategy increases liquidity and is necessitated by the continued shortening of maturities and more frequent repricing opportunities of the corporation s funding sources 
as of year end  approximately of all loans reprice or mature within days 
see table for additional detail regarding loan maturity and sensitivity to changes in interest rates at december within the corporation s overall interest rate risk management strategy  off balance sheet derivatives have been and may be used in the future as a cost and capital efficient way to manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the repricing or maturity of on balance sheet assets or liabilities 
as of december   the corporation did not have any off balance sheet derivative financial instruments nor did it hold any such financial instruments during although off balance sheet derivative financial instruments would not expose the corporation to credit risk equal to the notional amount of the contracts  the corporation would be exposed to credit risk to the extent of the fair value of the unrealized gain if any in the off balance sheet derivative instrument if the counterparty failed to perform 
credit risk resulting from a counterparty s nonperformance of any contracts would be monitored through routine review of the counterparty s financial ratings 
the corporation has not experienced any liquidity problems in the past nor are problems anticipated in the future 
reliance will continue to be placed on the same funding sources  primarily financial resources provided by operating activities and expansion of the core deposit base 
management will continue to monitor the corporation s interest sensitivity position with goals of ensuring adequate liquidity while at the same time seeking profitable spreads between the yields on funding uses and the rates paid for funding sources
