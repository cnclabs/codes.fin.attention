as mentioned previously  non interest expenses for reflect pre tax charges totaling million related to an initiative to refocus the company s resources on its core financial services  reduce operating expenses and exit from less profitable initiatives 
this initiative was undertaken in the second quarter of  when the board of directors made a change in executive management  with the expressed purpose of changing the company s strategic direction 
as of december   the company has accomplished the following goals of the initiative exited the venture capital and human resources consulting initiatives  closed the louisville  kentucky office  closed mortgage loan production offices in chattanooga  jackson and knoxville  tennessee  sold the corporate aircraft  sold the travel agency  sold a newly constructed building intended to house the company s corporate headquarters and consolidated office space in bowling green  kentucky  and realized additional cost savings in the company s retail delivery system of approximately million on an annualized pre tax basis  primarily through the reduction of administrative personnel 
based on a comparison of non interest expenses for the fourth quarter of to the second quarter excluding the million of charges to implement the plan  total operating expenses have been reduced by more than million on an annualized pre tax basis 
in addition to the charges associated with the refocus initiative  the company increased its provision for loan losses by million compared with and recorded a pre tax charge of million imposed by congressional legislation enacted during designed to re capitalize the savings association insurance fund saif 
all banks with saif insured deposits and all savings and loans were subject to the saif assessment 
the increased provision for loan losses in was primarily due to a deterioration in the quality of certain commercial credits in the second quarter of the year 
with the major components of the refocus initiative in place by year end  management believes the results of the third and fourth quarters of are more representative of the company s ongoing profitability 
excluding the saif assessment  annualized net income for those periods would have been million  which would have resulted in a return on assets of percent and a percent return on equity

it also reflects the general increase in interest rates on total interest bearing liabilities over the past year  and increased volumes of loans  certificates of deposit  and borrowed funds 
approximately million of the company s commercial and consumer loans are tied to the prime rate 
decreases in the prime lending rate  which began in the third quarter of  had a negative impact on net interest margin during as compared to although the prime rate leveled off in february  the company s funding costs continued to rise  as the company placed greater reliance on wholesale funding sources  such as brokered deposits and other borrowed funds 
as a result  the company s net interest rate spread the difference between the gross yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased  negatively impacting the net interest margin 
although the net interest rate spread fell by basis points in as compared with  the net interest margin was flat  due to a change in the composition of the balance sheet

this trend continued in  with the ratio of loans to total earning assets increasing to and securities dropping to 
the increased proportion of assets invested in relatively higher earning loans served to mitigate in and fully offset in the decline in the interest rate spread from the previous year

the following table presents a summary of the loan portfolio by category over that period 
loans outstanding december in thousands commercial      commercial real estate      residential real estate      consumer      total loans      less unearned income      loans net of unearned income      loan concentrations much of the increase in commercial and commercial real estate loans is financing the operations of the company s commercial customers 
although many of these loans are structured as mortgages  the company relies on the borrower s cash flow to service the loan  rather than on the sale of the underlying collateral 
commercial real estate loans include financing for industrial parks  residential developments  retail shopping centers  multi family apartment complexes  industrial buildings  fast food and mid scale restaurants  and hotels and motels 
the primary source of repayment cannot be traced to any specific industry group 
the percentage distribution of the company s loans  by industry  is shown in the following table 
loans by industry december  as a percentage of total loans agriculture apartment buildings construction and land development finance and insurance manufacturing durable goods non durable goods mining services health hotels and motels other than health and hotels wholesale trade retail trade restaurants food stores automotive other other commercial real estate all other commercial loans total commercial and commercial real estate loans residential real estate loans consumer loans total loans  net of unearned income substantially all of the company s loans are to customers located in kentucky and tennessee  in the immediate market areas of the banks 
however  the company has one million commercial loan to a mexican affiliate of a us corporation 
the loan represents financing for an essential part of the operations of an established customer located in the company s primary market area 
on december   the company s largest credit relationships consisted of loans and loan commitments ranging from million to million  none of which was classified as non performing 
the aggregate amount of these credit relationships was million 
the following table sets forth the maturity distribution and interest rate sensitivity of commercial and commercial real estate loans as of december  maturities are based upon contractual terms

non performing assets  which include non performing loans  foreclosed real estate and other foreclosed property  totaled million at year end  and the ratio of total non performing assets to total assets decreased to at year end  from at december  the following table presents information concerning non performing assets  including non accrual and restructured loans non performing assets december dollars in thousands non accrual loans      accruing loans which are contractually past due days or more      restructured loans  total non performing and restructured loans

management classifies commercial and commercial real estate loans as non accrual when principal or interest is past due days or more and the loan is not adequately collateralized and in the process of collection  or when  in the opinion of management  principal or interest is not likely to be paid in accordance with the terms of the obligation 
consumer loans are charged off after days of delinquency unless adequately secured and in the process of collection 
non accrual loans are not reclassified as accruing until principal and interest payments are brought current and future payments appear reasonably certain 
loans are categorized as restructured if the original interest rate  repayment terms  or both were restructured due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower 
however  restructured loans that demonstrate performance under the restructured terms and that yield a market rate of interest may be removed from restructured status in the year following the restructure 
two commercial credit relationships account for million  or  of the company s non accrual loans at december   and of total non performing and restructured loans 
the larger of these credits is to a specialty apparel manufacturer and the other is to a company in the coal mining industry 
an allowance for loan losses in the amount of thousand has been established for these credits in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for the impairment of a loan 
the remaining non accrual balance consists of various commercial and consumer loans  with no single loan exceeding  the increase over the past two years in accruing loans past due days or more is principally related to residential real estate loans 
personal bankruptcies  particularly chapter filings  have been rising in tennessee and kentucky over the past two years 
this form of bankruptcy forestalls foreclosure on a wage earner s residence as long as monthly payments are resumed and a small additional payment is made to the lender to be applied to the delinquent mortgage payments 
such a payment plan may stretch out to several years the period required to bring payments current 
although these loans may be well secured and in the process of collection  most are reported as more than days past due and accruing interest 
foreclosed real estate at december   includes one property with a book value of thousand  or of the outstanding balance 
this property was acquired through foreclosure in  with an unsatisfied loan balance at the time of million 
in order to facilitate the disposal of the property  the company entered into a joint venture with a real estate developer and developed the land for industrial and other commercial use 
subsequently  the company dissolved the joint venture and retained title to the property 
several parcels have been sold to date 
based on an appraisal of the property and previous sales experience  management does not anticipate a loss to be incurred on disposition of the remaining parcels 
a second property which was included in foreclosed real estate on december   is a manufacturing facility which was acquired in the fourth quarter of the property was sold in the fourth quarter of the remaining balance of foreclosed real estate consists of several properties  with no single property exceeding  as of december   the company had million of loans which were not included in the past due  non accrual or restructured categories  but for which known information about possible credit problems caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
based on management s evaluation  including current market conditions  cash flow generated and recent appraisals  no significant losses are anticipated in connection with these loans 
these loans are subject to continuing management attention and are considered in determining the level of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
the allowance represents an amount which  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans 
at december   the allowance was million  compared with million at december   and million at december  the allowance as a percentage of non performing loans was at december   as compared to at year end  and at december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans excluding mortgage loans held for sale at december   was  compared with at december   and at december  following is a summary of the changes in the allowance for loan losses for each of the past five years

allowance as a percentage of non performing and restructured loans the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined on an ongoing basis through analysis of the overall quality of the loan portfolio  historical loan loss experience  loan delinquency trends  and current and projected economic conditions 
additional allocations of the allowance are based on specifically identified potential loss situations 
these potential loss situations are identified by account officers evaluations of their own portfolios  as well as by an independent loan review function 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december   is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of that date 
that determination is based on the best information available to management  but necessarily involves uncertainties and matters of judgment and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision and could be susceptible to significant change in the future 
in addition  bank and thrift regulatory authorities  as a part of their periodic examinations of the banks  may reach different conclusions regarding the quality of the loan portfolio and the level of the allowance  which could result in additional provisions being made in future periods 
the tables below present an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by category of loan and a percentage distribution of the allowance allocation 
in making the allocation  consideration was given to such factors as management s evaluation of risk in each category  current economic conditions and charge off experience 
an allocation of the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the portion of the allowance which will be used to cover future charge offs in each loan category  but it does not preclude any portion of the allowance allocated to one type of loan from being used to absorb losses of another loan type

mortgage servicing rights the company adopted on a prospective basis effective january   statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights sfas 
sfas requires that rights to service mortgage loans for others be recognized as assets  without regard to whether those assets were acquired in purchase transactions or were acquired through loan originations 
in prior years  only purchased mortgage servicing rights msr s were recognized as assets 
msr s totaled million at december   compared with million at december   and million at year end during and  the company purchased servicing portfolios with mortgage loan principal balances of billion and billion  respectively 
the company recognized msr s of million and million  respectively  on these purchased portfolios 
the carrying value of msr s and the related amortization are evaluated quarterly in relation to their fair values 
the company evaluates the carrying value of the msr s by estimating the present value of the future net servicing income of the rights  using a discounted valuation method and based on management s best estimate of remaining loan lives 
serviced loans are stratified into four interest rate tranches and two loan types 
impairment and subsequent adjustments in each stratum  if any  are recognized by a valuation allowance and a charge against servicing income 
prepayments of mortgage loans can have a considerable impact on the value of the msr portfolio 
prepayments result from a variety of factors  but a declining mortgage loan interest rate environment is generally considered to be the most significant of these 
as of december   approximately of the msr recognized on the balance sheet was related to loans which have contractual interest rates from to  with a weighted average rate of 
loans with contractual rates from to  with a weighted average rate of  account for another of the msr balance 
if mortgage rates should decline substantially from current levels  the carrying value of the msr s could become impaired in future periods 
to mitigate this risk  in the company purchased a million notional amount interest rate floor contract in which the company will receive interest on the notional amount to the extent that the interest rate on ten year constant maturity us treasury notes falls below 
the cost of this contract was  and its fair value as of december   was  the cost  which is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet  is being amortized on a straight line basis over the five year life of the contract 
in january  the company purchased a second five year floor contract  with a million notional amount and a floor rate 
the cost of this contract was  management believes that the increase in market value of these two floor contracts which would result from a basis point drop in the interest rate on ten year treasuries would substantially offset the impairment in the msr likely to occur with such a decline in interest rates 
although management believes it is unlikely that ten year treasury rates will drop below in the foreseeable future  and may take additional action to limit the company s exposure if rates begin to decline significantly  the company is currently exposed to potential impairment of the msr asset if rates should drop by more than basis points 
deposits total deposits averaged billion in  an million  or  increase over approximately of the increase in average deposits was due to brokered certificates of deposit issued during million in the second quarter and million in the fourth quarter in order to fund loan growth 
average deposits for were billion  a increase over the company issued in the first quarter of million of brokered certificates of deposit and purchased million of deposits from an unaffiliated bank 
excluding these transactions  average deposits would have grown approximately million from to during the company implemented a program that sweeps excess funds from targeted interest bearing demand accounts into money market accounts 
this program has significantly reduced the federal reserve bank reserve requirements for the banks

due to an unusually high demand in the market for overnight funds on december   the rate the company paid for federal funds  excluding repurchase agreements  on that date was also unusually high 
the weighted average rate on the company s federal funds purchased was on december   and was on the first business day after year end 
other short term borrowings principally represent federal home loan bank fhlb advances to tfb fsb and tfb ky with varying maturity dates  which are funding residential mortgage and commercial loans 
long term debt averaged million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in is due to the issuance by tfb ky in the fourth quarter of of million of two year notes and million of three year notes under a million senior bank note program  in the second quarter of another million of four year bank notes were issued 
these notes were issued to support growth in the loan portfolio 
notes issued to date bear interest at fixed rates of  and  respectively 
the notes issued in have been effectively converted to floating rate instruments through the use of interest rate swap transactions 
interest rate swaps are discussed more fully in the asset liability management section which follows and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  tfb ky borrowed on a long term basis million from the fhlb in the first quarter of to fund residential mortgage and commercial loans 
long term debt also includes financing from an unaffiliated commercial bank for the company s leveraged esop 
total esop debt was million at december   and million at december  the company has a million unsecured operating line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank that is used from time to time to supplement the company s cash requirements 
the line was not in use at december  or also  under the book entry senior bank note program  tfb ky may issue up to an additional million of bank notes from time to time in maturities from days to years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the terms of these borrowings 
the company s capital ratios at december  and calculated in accordance with regulatory guidelines were as follows december tier risk based regulatory minimum total risk based regulatory minimum leverage regulatory minimum capital ratios of all of the company s subsidiaries are in excess of applicable minimum regulatory capital ratio requirements at december  the decrease in these ratios over the past year is due to asset growth particularly commercial and commercial real estate loans combined with minimal growth in shareholders equity as a result of the decline in net income in notwithstanding the decline in net income  primarily due to the loss incurred in the second quarter  the board of directors chose to maintain the quarterly dividend at 
as a result  the company paid dividends slightly in excess of earnings for although there can be no assurance  management expects the company will pay dividends in of approximately to of net income 
approximately half of the million increase in equity capital during was provided by retained earnings 
most of the remaining portion was due to a million decline in the net unrealized loss on securities available for sale 
to maintain a desired level of liquidity  the company has several sources of funds available 
the company primarily relies upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities  to provide cash used in its investing activities 
as is typical of most banking companies  significant financing activities include issuance of common stock and long term debt  deposit gathering  and the use of short term borrowing facilities  such as federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  fhlb advances and lines of credit 
the company s primary investing activities include purchases of securities and loan originations  offset by maturities  prepayments and sales of securities  and loan payments 
at december   the retained earnings of the banks totaled million  of which million was available for the payment of dividends to the parent company 
asset liability management managing interest rate risk is fundamental to the financial services industry 
the company s policies are designed to manage the inherently different maturity and repricing characteristics of the lending and deposit acquisition lines of business to achieve a desired interest sensitivity position and to limit exposure to interest rate risk 
the maturity and repricing characteristics of the company s lending and deposit activities create a naturally asset sensitive structure 
by using a combination of on and off balance sheet financial instruments  the company manages interest rate sensitivity while optimizing net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy  liquidity needs  the interest rate and economic outlook  market opportunities and customer requirements 
the company uses an earnings simulation model to monitor and evaluate the impact of changing interest rates on earnings 
the simulation model used by the company is designed to reflect the dynamics of all interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments  combining the various factors affecting rate sensitivity into a two year earnings outlook 
among the factors the model utilizes are rate of change differentials  such as federal funds rates versus savings account rates  maturity effects  such as calls on securities  and rate barrier effects  such as caps or floors on loans 
it also captures changing balance sheet levels and floating rate loans that may be tied or related to prime  treasury notes  cd rates or other rate indices  which do not necessarily move identically as rates change 
in addition  it captures leads and lags that occur as rates move away from current levels  and the effects of prepayments on various assets  such as residential mortgages  mortgage backed securities and consumer loans 
the model is updated monthly for multiple interest rate scenarios  projected changes in balance sheet categories and other relevant assumptions 
in developing multiple rate scenarios  an econometric model is employed to forecast key rates  based on the cyclical nature and historic volatility of those rates 
a stochastic view of net interest income is derived once probabilities have been assigned to those key rates 
by forecasting a most likely rate environment  the effects on net interest income of adjusting those rates up or down can reveal the company s approximate interest rate risk exposure level 
as of december   the company s most likely rate environment assumed the federal funds rate and prime lending rate at and  respectively  rising to and  respectively  by december of the following illustrates the effects on net interest income of an immediate shift in market interest rates compared to the most likely rate assumptions used in the company s model basis point change bp bp bp bp increase decrease in net interest income as of december   management believes the company s balance sheet was in an asset sensitive position  as the repricing characteristics of the balance sheet were such that an increase in interest rates would have a positive effect on earnings and a decrease in interest rates would have a negative effect on earnings 
it should be noted that some of the assumptions made in the use of the simulation model will inevitably not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances will occur  in addition  the simulation model does not take into account any future actions which could be undertaken to reduce an adverse impact if there were a change in interest rate expectations or in the actual level of interest rates 
a second interest rate sensitivity tool utilized by the company is the quantification of market value changes for all assets and liabilities  given an increase or decrease in interest rates 
this approach provides a longer term view of interest rate risk  capturing all expected future cash flows 
assets and liabilities with option characteristics are valued based on numerous interest rate path valuations using statistical rate simulation techniques 
to assist in achieving a desired level of interest rate sensitivity the company has entered into off balance sheet interest rate swap transactions which partially neutralize the asset sensitive position which is inherent in the balance sheet 
the company pays a variable interest rate on each swap and receives a fixed rate 
in a higher interest rate environment  the increased contribution to net interest income from on balance sheet assets will substantially offset any negative impact on net interest income from interest rate swap transactions 
conversely  if interest rates decline  the swaps will mitigate the company s exposure to reduced net interest income

interest rate swap transactions are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements
