synchronized supply chain management refers to managing the complex interactions involved in the flows of products through the supply chain  and involves forecasting product demand and coordinating the timing of distribution  manufacturing  procurement and transportation activities to meet this demand  not only across an entire enterprise  but also among an enterprise and its suppliers and customers 
the company believes it is the only provider of an integrated suite of strategic  tactical and operational supply chain planning tools including a high level optimizer and products that address the four key operational areas of supply chain management demand planning  supply planning  manufacturing scheduling and transportation management 
additionally  the company markets and supports the statgraphics personal systems product  which provides statistical tools for quality management in manufacturing companies 
the company derived approximately   and of its revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  from the company s supply chain management software and services 
results of operations revenues software products 
the company s software products license revenues increased in fiscal and fiscal because the company s sales and marketing efforts for supply chain management software products were effective  and because of increased market acceptance of such products 
these factors more than offset decreased revenues from the personal systems software product 
in fiscal  software products revenues increased to approximately of total revenues 
this increase resulted from the company s effective sales and marketing and because the company increased its resources devoted to generating software products revenues more rapidly than its resources for producing services revenues 
see costs of revenues and operating expenses 
in fiscal  software products revenues decreased to approximately of total revenues from approximately in fiscal  largely because consulting  maintenance and other services revenues increased at a greater rate than software products revenues

software products license revenues increased in fiscal because of increases in the number of licenses and the average license fee per transaction 
these increases occurred largely because the company increased the number of its sales and marketing employees  the company s sales productivity initiatives generated results  contributions from the company s international operations increased significantly and manugistics alliances with complementary software companies and consulting firms led to additional revenues 
in addition  revenues increased because of increased market acceptance of the company s products  including new product offerings and new versions released during fiscal  which resulted in part from the recognition by prospects and customers that they could rapidly realize significant benefits from effective supply chain management 
these companies licensed the company s software to help them obtain these benefits 
in fiscal  software products license revenues increased primarily because of an increase in the number of licenses 
this increase resulted from increased market acceptance of the company s products and from an increase in the company s sales and marketing efforts  which was made possible largely by the addition of sales and marketing employees 
in addition  the company generated a small amount of revenues during the fourth fiscal quarter through its alliances with complementary firms 
in fiscal  and  the company derived the substantial majority of its software license revenues from direct sales 
however  the company has embarked on a strategy of expanding its product distribution through alliances with complementary software vendors 
consequently  the company anticipates that software license revenues derived from indirect sales by these complementary vendors will increase as a proportion of software license revenues

personal systems 
software products license revenues decreased in fiscal and fiscal primarily because customers and prospective customers selected competing products and because the company sold the assets of its apl plus business for unix and personal computer systems effective october  following this disposition  the only personal systems product that the company has marketed is statgraphics and the company has decreased the resources dedicated to that product 
management of the company believes that demand for statgraphics will continue to decrease

in fiscal  the company plans to continue to incur relatively high levels of both sales and marketing expenditures and product development expenditures as it pursues its strategies of expanding its business into new geographic and other markets and expanding its distribution through alliances and rapidly developing and delivering new product features and functions 
the percentage of revenues represented by these items may vary because the company s total quarterly and annual revenues have varied in the past and are likely to continue to vary 
also  the percentages of revenues represented by sales and marketing expenses  product development and the cost of services can be affected by the total amount of expenses associated with new employees and by the timing delays between the dates that these employees begin work and the dates they first become productive after training

see results of operations product development 
cost of goods expenses increased in fiscal mainly because of a write off of obsolete and slow moving inventory 
the cost of software sold decreased as a percentage of software products revenues in fiscal from fiscal largely because software products revenues increased more rapidly than the cost of software sold 
the cost of software sold increased in fiscal because the amount of the increase in amortization was more than the amount of the decrease in cost of goods 
cost of goods expenses decreased in fiscal because of decreases in the number of units of personal systems products that were sold and decreases in the per unit costs of certain personal systems products 
the cost of software sold decreased as a percentage of software products revenues in fiscal from fiscal because software products revenues increased at a greater rate than the cost of software sold and because supply chain management products  which generally have a proportionately lower cost of goods per product  constituted a higher proportion of total software products revenues 
cost of software sold increased less rapidly than software products revenues because of the decrease in the cost of goods component 
cost of consulting  maintenance and other services 
the cost of consulting  maintenance and other services increased in fiscal primarily because the company added personnel in both north america and europe to provide the consulting and maintenance services that generated the corresponding increase in supply chain management revenues from consulting  maintenance and other services 
as a percentage of consulting  maintenance and other services revenues  the cost of consulting  maintenance and other services decreased in fiscal largely because a portion of the increase in corresponding revenues was generated by maintenance and product support  which can be provided more efficiently by serving a larger client base  and because of improved utilization of the company s consulting employees 
in fiscal  the cost of consulting  maintenance and other services increased primarily because the company added consulting personnel  primarily in north america 
the increase in the cost of consulting services was partially offset by a decrease in the cost of maintenance 
maintenance expenses decreased in part because the company created a smaller  more focused group to provide maintenance services and because of improved software quality

purchased research and development 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company acquired by merger all of the outstanding capital stock of avyx  inc  a developer and services provider of custom manufacturing scheduling systems 
the company incurred a non recurring charge to operations of million

excluding the effect of this write off on taxable income  the pro forma effective tax rate would have been approximately 
management of the company believes that  in fiscal  the effective tax rate of the company on a consolidated basis is likely to be approximately  excluding one time charges taken in connection with acquisitions or other transactions 
this estimate is based on current domestic and foreign tax law and is thus subject to change 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the effective tax rate represented by the company s provision for income taxes in fiscal was approximately  largely because of a reduction of a valuation allowance associated with net operating losses of the company s germany subsidiary  which more than offset higher marginal tax rates applicable to certain income generated by the company s foreign subsidiaries 
net income and earnings per share fiscal year ended february or  change change net income excluding    purchased research and development percentage of total revenues purchased research and development  net income    percentage of total revenues earnings per share excluding purchased research and development purchased research and development earnings per share weighted average common shares and equivalent shares outstanding    liquidity and capital resources february or  change change working capital    cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities    the company has historically financed its growth primarily through funds generated from operations and through proceeds from offerings of capital stock 
the increase in working capital at february  from february  resulted principally from increases in the company s accounts receivable and cash balances  which more than offset a decrease in marketable securities resulting from the company s payments in may in connection with the acquisition of avyx  inc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s operating activities provided cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
operating cash flows increased largely because the cash flows resulting from net income were augmented by increases in non cash expenses and increases in deferred revenues  accrued compensation  other accrued liabilities and income taxes payable  and offset by increases in accounts receivable 
at fiscal year end  accounts receivable were million  compared to million at fiscal year end  primarily as a result of increases in the number and size of software license transactions 
deferred revenue increased from million to million because of growth in software licensing activity and increases in related services and maintenance revenues 
investing activities used cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales of marketable securities provided cash  but the amounts provided were more than offset by cash used for purchases of property and equipment  capitalization of software development costs  purchases of marketable securities and acquisitions 
in accordance with its strategies for positioning itself to be able to meet anticipated demand for supply chain management software and of rapidly delivering new product features and functions  the company used cash to acquire computer and other equipment  to expand its facilities and to expand its product development efforts 
financing activities provided cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  cash from financing activities was derived primarily from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under stock purchase plans 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the company received approximately million from the private placement of  newly issued shares of common stock 
the company has an unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a commercial bank 
under the terms of the facility  the company may request advances in the aggregate amount of up to million 
the company may make borrowings under the facility for short term working capital purposes or for acquisitions 
acquisition related borrowings are limited to million per acquisition 
the facility contains certain financial covenants that the company believes are typical for a facility of this nature and amount 
this facility succeeds a similar facility that the company maintained with two commercial banks  one of which is the lender under the current facility  and will expire in september  unless renewed 
there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at february  during the first quarter of fiscal  the company and information resources  inc iri entered into agreements relating to the company s development of a supply chain planning solution that will incorporate iri s point of sale scanner data into the company s supply chain management software 
under the agreements  the company paid million to iri and the company will market iri s point of sale data and will have l year  exclusive rights among supply chain software vendors in most geographic markets to incorporate iri s data  the company and iri will resell certain of each other s products  and the company might acquire certain other products of iri subject to the satisfaction of certain contingencies 
as part of these agreements  the company has committed that it will generate a minimum of million in revenues for iri from specified products over periods of approximately one to three years  beginning after the occurrence of certain events 
this commitment is subject to the satisfaction of significant contingencies specified in the agreements 
although the company currently anticipates that it will be able to produce a sufficient amount of qualifying revenues to satisfy its commitment  if the company is unable to generate the minimum annual revenues set forth in the agreements  it will be obligated to pay to iri from its own funds an amount equal to the difference between the qualifying revenues generated and the required minimum  which could result in a decrease in working capital 
the company investigates potential candidates for acquisition  joint venture opportunities or other relationships on an ongoing basis 
depending on certain factors  including the amount  nature  method and timing of the consideration to be paid by the company  any such acquisitions  transactions or relationships might result in a decrease in working capital 
the company believes that existing cash balances  marketable securities  funds generated from operations and amounts available under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet its anticipated liquidity and working capital requirements for the next to months 
if the company decides to expand its operations more rapidly  to broaden or enhance its products more rapidly  to acquire businesses or technologies or to make other significant expenditures to respond to market opportunities or competitive pressures  then the company may need additional funds at an earlier time 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and the business section of this annual report on form l k contain certain forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
in addition  the company may publish forward looking statements from time to time relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects and strategies  technological developments  new products  research and development activities and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of l provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements in this annual report or elsewhere in the future 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the business  operating results or financial condition of the company include those set forth above under risk factors and the following the company believes that the market for supply chain management software is expanding rapidly 
if market demand for the company s products does not continue to grow rapidly  because of such factors as adverse changes in domestic or international business and economic conditions  the timely availability and acceptance of the company s products  technological change or the effect of competitive products and pricing  software license revenue growth could be adversely affected 
revenues for any period depend on the volume  timing and size of license agreements 
the company typically ships software products shortly after license agreements are signed  and  therefore  does not maintain any material contract backlog 
the timing of license agreements is difficult to forecast because software sales cycles are affected by the size of transactions and other external factors such as general business or economic conditions or competitors actions 
a small variation in the timing of software licensing transactions  particularly at or near the end of any quarter or year  can cause significant variations in software products license revenues in any period 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract complemenatary software vendors  consulting firms or other organizations that will be able to market the company s products effectively or that will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any organization will continue its involvement with the company and its products  and the loss of important organizations could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the timing of releases of the company s software products can be affected by client needs  marketplace demands and technological advances 
development plans frequently change  and it is difficult to predict with accuracy the release dates for products in development
