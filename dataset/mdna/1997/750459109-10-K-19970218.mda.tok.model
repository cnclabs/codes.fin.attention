item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview total revenue was million for  compared to million for net income was million for  an increase of from million for revenues and net income increased primarily due to the purchase of multibus and irmx from intel in april and higher revenues from design wins ramping into production during net income for was also materially affected by the increase in the company s effective tax rate from in to in except for the historical statements and information  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the following are among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements business conditions and growth in the electronics industry and general economies  both domestic and international  uncertainty of market development  dependence on a limited number of oem customers  dependence on limited or sole source suppliers  dependence on the relationship with intel  dependence on intel s support of the embedded computer market  lower than expected customer orders  competitive factors  including increased competition  new product offerings by competitors and price pressures  the availability of parts and components at reasonable prices  changes in product mix  dependence on proprietary technology  technological difficulties and resource constraints encountered in developing new products  and product shipment interruptions due to manufacturing difficulties 
the forward looking statements contained in this md a regarding industry trends  product development and introductions  and liquidity and future business activities should be considered in light of these factors 
on april   the company purchased substantially all of the assets of intel that were dedicated to the design  manufacture and sale of all standard and custom multibus i and multibus ii products multibus collectively the acquisition 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the acquisition  intel licensed intel s irmx real time operating software system irmx to the company 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method 
the results of operations for multibus have been included in the financial statements since the date of acquisition 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and year ended december  revenues cost of sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative income from operations interest income  net income before income tax provision income tax provision net income years ended december    and revenues 
revenues increased to million for from million for the increase in revenues in resulted primarily from the acquisition of multibus from intel on april  and from volume increases in oem sales 
additionally  included within revenues for is million of royalty payments from intel in connection with backlog retained by intel pursuant to the terms of the acquisition 
revenues increased to million for from million for the increase for was primarily the result of the onset of significant custom oem sales 
this reflects historical trends in which the company initially focused its sales effort on standard board level products offered through sales representatives to a wide variety of customers who typically purchased in relatively small unit volumes 
in  the company began to focus significantly more effort on selling to large and mid sized oems by substantially increasing its direct sales force 
as a result of this change in focus  revenues increased substantially 
however  because of the relatively long sales cycles associated with oem customers  increases in both absolute revenues and the percentage of revenues represented by oem sales have occurred gradually over time 
for  sales to the company s largest customers constituted of revenues  as compared to and for and  respectively 
gross margin 
gross margin for increased to from for primarily as a result of royalties received from intel for backlog retained in connection with the multibus acquisition  component price decreasing faster than price changes to the company s customers  the mix of product sold through distributors versus direct sales  and product mix for consisting of a larger portion of higher margin products shipped relative to lower margin products shipped 
additionally  included within cost of goods sold for is million of inventory valuation adjustments that resulted from purchase accounting in connection with the multibus acquisition 
gross margins are expected to return to targeted levels in future periods  which are lower than those achieved in gross margin decreased to for from for primarily as a result of increased oem sales 
oem sales are characterized by longer product life cycles and generally lower gross margins that can vary throughout the product life cycle 
gross margins are typically lower in the early stages of production for oem sales and have the potential to improve over time 
the company establishes gross margin targets based on the nature of the sales it is pursuing and the desire to establish new oem relationships by pricing aggressively to achieve key sales 
however  many of the factors affecting gross margins  such as variances in unit volumes and timing of orders and component cost  are difficult or impossible to predict and can cause the company to be subject to unplanned margin variances 
gross margins on oem sales are also particularly sensitive to changes in customer mix because of both margin variances among individual products and the relative importance of a single large sale on overall operating results 
to mitigate the effect of short term margin variances  the company may employ step pricing techniques in which unit prices decline over the life of the product to reflect anticipated production efficiencies and or component cost reductions  or various cost sharing or cost plus pricing techniques that serve to reduce the margin risk to the company 
indirect manufacturing costs have steadily decreased from through as a result of increases in operating efficiencies associated with higher unit production volumes 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million for from million for  primarily as a result of increased investment in new product development and costs of enhancements to existing products 
also included within research and development for is  to expense in process research and development acquired in connection with the multibus acquisition 
the company continues to invest in new design wins for oem customers and the dollar increases reflect steady increases in the number of employees working in research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million for from million for this increase reflected the company s continued investment in new product development and costs of enhancements to existing products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for  and to million for from million for selling  general and administrative expense have increased primarily as a result of increased personnel  facilities  and travel  to support higher levels of sales since and to support the acquired multibus operations in selling  general and administrative expenses have declined as a percentage of revenues to for  from and for and  respectively  primarily as a result of operating efficiencies achieved by spreading fixed costs over a larger revenue base  offset partially by increases in costs required to expand international operations 
interest income  net 
interest income  net increased to million for from million for  and increased for from  for the increases for and were primarily the result of interest income earned from the net proceeds of the company s initial public offering in october these increases were partially offset in by increased interest expense as a result of the company entering into a long term lease agreement in the second quarter of to finance certain capital equipment  and the company drawing down on its line of credit agreement in the third quarter of income tax provision 
the income tax provisions for  and reflect effective income tax rates of   and  respectively 
the increases in the provision for income tax are primarily attributable to the exhaustion of the majority of the company s tax loss carryforwards in and the depletion of tax credits in liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had million in cash and short term investment grade securities  which represents the company s principal source of liquidity 
as of december   the company had working capital of approximately million 
the working capital balance increased primarily due to cash generated from operations and the increase in accounts receivable and inventories as a result of the acquisition of multibus in april net cash provided by or used for operating activities was   and for  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in was largely attributable to enhanced profitability offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and in inventories of million 
these increases were largely attributable to expansion of the company s operations  including the acquisition of multibus in april commencing september   the company entered into a new million line of credit with a bank 
amounts outstanding under the line of credit will accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the lender s prime rate 
the company has not drawn any funds under this line of credit 
capital expenditures were   and in  and  respectively 
these capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of leasehold improvements  manufacturing equipment  and plant modernization 
the company moved to a new headquarters and manufacturing facility in october in addition to certain tenant improvements and furniture and fixtures which will be purchased in connection with this new facility  the company purchased in early two adjacent parcels of land and in early one adjacent parcel of land for future expansion 
capital expenditures for the next months  including expenditures related to a second engineering building  are expected to range from million to million 
the company believes its existing cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next months 
because the company s capital requirements cannot be predicted with certainty  there is no assurance that the company will not require additional financing prior to the expiration of months
