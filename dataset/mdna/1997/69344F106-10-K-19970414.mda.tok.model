item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
description of forward looking statements 
this portion of this annual report contains forward looking statements relating to the future activities of the modem chipset business which the company exited during the third quarter of fiscal  modem related revenues  gross margins  expenditures on research and development  and marketing  general and administrative activities  and sufficiency of capital resources 
actual results may differ from those projected in the forward looking statements for a number of reasons  including those described in risk factors 
general 
sierra semiconductor designs  develops  markets and supports high performance system solutions for advanced communications markets 
the company s products are used in broadband communications infrastructures  high bandwidth networks and multimedia personal computers 
in the third quarter of the company announced its decision to exit from the personal computer modem chipset business  and to restructure its non networking operations  in order to focus on the networking and infrastructure semiconductor businesses 
consistent with this strategy  the company acquired  in the third quarter  ethernet switching assets  intellectual property and certain other assets from bit  inc in the fourth quarter of  the company discontinued operations of prometheus 
the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to exclude the prometheus results from continuing operations 
restructuring on september   the company recorded charges of  in connection with the company s decision to exit from the modem chipset business and the associated restructuring of the company s non networking product operations 
the charges were recorded in cost of sales as an inventory write down  and as restructure costs in operating expenses 
the elements of the total charge as of september  and december  are as follows restructuring restructuring charge reserve september  write down cash december  of assets outlay in millions write down of inventories to net realizable value   employee termination benefits    loss on supplier commitments and write off of prepaid expenses   write down of excess fixed assets and assets related to capacity commitments   provision for price protection and product returns   excess facility costs   write down of goodwill related to company s bv subsidiary in holland   severance and closure costs related to europe   the company ceased manufacturing its modem chipset products in september and expects to complete the shut down of the remaining non networking operations in san jose by the middle of no sale was anticipated in accounting for the restructuring 
the company will continue to manufacture certain of its multimedia products in order to utilize components either on hand or under firm committed orders 
as the non networking operations wind down  related work forces have been and will continue to be reduced 
termination benefits for approximately employees associated with the company s non networking operations have been and will be paid as employees reach their termination dates  between november and july as of december   employees employed as of the date of the restructuring in the company s non networking operations had reached their termination dates and have left the company as planned in the restructuring 
employees employed as of the date of the restructuring in the company s non networking operations will reach their termination dates per the restructure plan during as a result of its exit from the modem chipset business  the company identified incremental impairments in the carrying value of its non networking inventory and losses on supplier commitments arising directly from the decision to stop manufacturing modem chipset inventory 
additionally  the company identified certain prepaid expenses and other commitments that  due to the exit from the modem chipset and other non networking operations  will provide no future economic benefit to the company 
in conjunction with the decision to exit the modem chipset business  the company is subject to incremental pricing pressure and potential returns of modem chipset products 
an estimate of the potential impact of price protection and product returns has been included in the restructuring charge 
in connection with its decision to discontinue non networking operations  the company evaluated the ongoing value of the fixed assets associated with these operations 
based on this evaluation  the company identified approximately million of non networking property and equipment that will continue to be utilized in the company s networking operations 
the remaining non networking property and equipment  with a carrying amount of approximately million  consists primarily of testers  engineering workstations  and computer equipment 
a small portion of these assets will be utilized only during the wind down of the non networking operations through the middle of the majority of these assets will not be utilized and the company is attempting to dispose of such assets 
as a result  in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
 the company determined that these assets were impaired and wrote them down by approximately million to their estimated fair market value 
fair value was based on estimated net recoverable salvage value of assets being held for disposal 
based upon net undiscounted estimated cash flows to be generated by these assets  no impairment of assets which will continue to be utilized was identified 
prior to the company s decision to exit from the modem chipset business and the associated restructure of its non networking operations  the company entered into noncancellable capital leases for equipment to be used by one of the company s outside foundries in exchange for guaranteed capacity and future pricing considerations 
due to the company s exit and restructure plan  the company estimates that it will not be able to fully utilize the contracted capacity and pricing considerations 
the company s analysis of cash flows expected from the reduced capacity utilization at this foundry  while incurring the full contracted capital leases obligation  resulted in an impairment of approximately million of the company s assets 
the portion of the charge related to excess facility costs primarily consists of amounts to be incurred by the company under a seven year noncancelable operating lease expiring in the company plans to occupy a portion of the building through june after june  the company expects that the building will be vacant 
the company is actively trying to sublet the building  however  it is expected that a sublessor may not be located for approximately eighteen months 
as a result  the charge consists of the unused percentage of the lease obligations from september through june and of the lease obligations for eighteen months thereafter  and associated costs for operating and maintaining the facilities 
the company s operations in europe were closed as a result of the decision to exit the modem chipset business 
costs related to the shutdown of the european subsidiaries  including severance payments and excess facilities costs  are included in the restructuring charge 
additionally  the restructuring charge includes a write down of the remaining goodwill related to the company s holland operation 
cash expenditures associated with the restructuring accrued liabilities were approximately million in it is expected that approximately million of cash expenditures related to the restructuring will occur during the first half of subsequent cash expenditures related primarily to leases accrued in the restructuring will be approximately million 
reasons for restructuring during  the company was experiencing increasing demand for its modem chipset products  as shipment volumes were increasing and more customers were requesting and ordering products for future deliveries 
as a result  the company then increased the order rate and volume from its suppliers for products 
also in  the industry was experiencing a severe shortage of foundry capacity to produce wafers for semiconductor devices 
this caused companies like sierra to have to place order commitments with its foundry suppliers with much longer lead times  and extending more than several months in most cases 
in the first half of  there was a combination of events which changed the entire modem market environment 
in a very short time period  the demand for the modem speed technology changed from v 
chips kbps speed to v 
chips kbps  and the demand for slower speed modem products declined quickly and dramatically 
however  the longer lead times required by the foundries for orders placed earlier in the year and in late resulted in products being delivered and accumulating in the company s inventories 
as foundry capacity  previously in limited supply  became more readily available  customer preferences shifted to higher volume producers of v 
and faster modem products 
this combination resulted in increased levels of the company s inventory for both lower speed and higher speed modem products  as the foundries had more capacity to produce product and became aggressive in trying to build and ship even more semiconductor products to sierra and other modem chipset companies 
these factors combined to create excess inventory and a precipitous decline in prices during the second and third quarters of the company saw this declining price and excessive inventory position as a major change in the modem marketplace 
thus  in the third quarter of  the company made the decision to exit the lower margin modem chipset market  and to invest future resources in higher margin networking products 
concurrent with the company s decision to exit the modem chipset business  the company also decided to restructure its other non networking product operations in the graphics and custom areas  which no longer fit with the company s focus on networking products 
the company decided not to expend funds for research and development on new products outside the networking area 
impact of restructuring the company s decisions to exit from the modem chipset business and to restructure its non networking product operations are expected to result in a decline of revenues derived from modem  graphic and custom integrated circuits 
in  modem  graphic and custom integrated circuit revenues were million  approximately lower than revenues in in  the company expects these revenues to decline significantly  although revenues in these product areas may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as the company sells off its modem chipset inventory 
research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses related to these non networking product operations in were million  down from million in the company expects these expenses to decline significantly in due to reduced headcount and the elimination of new research and development efforts in the non networking business 
revenues from sales of modem chipset products will continue to be reported until the company disposes its existing inventory  which the company expects to occur during acquisition of ethernet switching assets consistent with the company s strategy to focus on the networking and infrastructure semiconductor business  in the third quarter of  a subsidiary of the company acquired the ethernet switching assets  intellectual property and certain other assets from bit  incorporated  a privately held company in beaverton  oregon 
these assets were acquired in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock and other consideration 
the aggregate value of this transaction was approximately  which includes acquisition costs incurred by the company 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction  with a charge in the quarter of  for in process research and development 
approximately  of technology assets were capitalized  and will be amortized over seven years 
results of operations net revenues change change net revenues  networking products user interface other user interface modem total net revenues net revenues in remained approximately at the same level as revenues 
substantial growth in sales of networking products  and a small increase in modem chipset product sales  were offset by declines in other user interface product sales  which were primarily due to lower sales of graphic chip products 
the small increase in modem chipset sales increase over resulted from increased unit sales of both v 
and v 
modem products in the first half of the year  while in the second half of the year the company experienced declining unit sales and substantially lower prices for modem products 
the change in net revenues in from was primarily attributable to increased sales of networking and modem products 
sales of modem products are expected to decline during the first two quarters of and to be minimal in the second half of the company anticipates a decline in average selling prices for these discontinued products and cannot predict the level of unit sales 
as a result  revenues for are expected to be lower than revenues in gross profit change change gross profit  networking products percentage of net networking revenues user interface products percentage of net user interface revenues user interface products excluding valuation reserve for modem chipset inventory percentage of net user interface revenues total gross profit percentage of net revenues total gross profit excluding valuation reserve for modem chipset inventory percentage of net revenues total gross profit increased from to as a result of increased sales of higher gross margin networking products as a percentage of total net revenues 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues also increased due to the increased proportion of sales of higher gross margin networking products 
the gross profit increase from to was primarily due to increased sales in all product lines 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased from to as a result of increased sales of higher margin networking products 
in the near term  as the company continues to sell its existing inventories of modem chipset products  the overall gross margin of the company may decline depending on the percentage of modem chipset product revenues relative to total revenues 
overall gross margin may also be impacted unfavorably due to anticipated erosion of modem pricing as the company liquidates its existing inventories 
in the longer term  the company may experience declining gross profits as a percentage of total net revenues if anticipated decreases in average selling prices of existing networking products are not offset by commensurate reductions in product costs  or by an offsetting increase in gross profit contribution from new higher gross margin networking products 
operating expenses and charges  change change research and development percentage of net revenues in process research development percentage of net revenues marketing  general administrative percentage of net revenues purchase price adjustment compensation percentage of net revenues restructure costs percentage of net revenues research and development 
research and development expenses increased in primarily due to greater research and development efforts for networking products 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses increased as the rate of spending growth exceeded the rate of net revenues growth 
during research and development expenses increased from primarily due to increased investment in networking products 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses declined in from as the rate of growth of sales exceeded the rate of growth of research and development spending 
in the near term  the company expects research and development spending to decline in absolute dollars  due to the reduction in user interface research and development as associated headcount is reduced due to the restructuring  offset partially by increases in research and development spending on networking products 
in process research and development 
in process research and development charges incurred in are a result of the acquisition of the ethernet switching and other assets from bit  inc the in process research and development charge in relates to the acquisition of pmc see note to consolidated financial statements 
marketing  general  and administrative 
in  marketing  general  and administrative expenses remained at the same levels as as increases in these expenses in networking products primarily related to increased staffing were offset by declines in these expenses and headcount of user interface groups due to the restructuring 
as a percentage of net revenues  total marketing  general and administrative expenses remained at approximately the same level 
the increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses in relative to was primarily due to support of networking products 
as a percentage of net revenues  marketing  general and administrative expenses declined from to  as the rate of increase in spending was less than the rate of revenue growth 
in the near term  the company expects marketing  general and administrative spending to decline in absolute dollars  due to reduced personnel performing these functions for user interface products  although the company does not expect to increase spending in these areas to support networking products 
pmc purchase price adjustment 
in completing the pmc acquisition in the third quarter of  the company recorded a million charge relating to the compensation expense associated with the purchase price adjustment shares reserved for issuance to the employees shareholders of pmc 
the million balance of the acquisition cost was allocated to goodwill 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring 
restructure costs are part of the charge of million recorded in connection with the company s decision to exit from the modem chipset business and the associated restructuring of the company s non networking product operations 
the restructure credit reflects the reversal of the remainder of a restructure charge deemed no longer necessary from the restructuring of the company s operations in holland and the us interest income expense  net  change change interest income expense  net percentage of net revenues interest income 
interest income increased in and due to higher cash balances available to invest and earn interest 
interest expense in increased from due to short term borrowing 
interest expense currently relates primarily to the company s financing arrangements for leases  and financing of previously established foundry commitments 
interest expense in declined from as interest expense related primarily to interest expense on notes issued in and repaid in the interest expense was offset partially by interest earned on the company s cash balances see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
gain on sale of sitel sierra 
during the fourth quarter of  the company sold its interest in sitel sierra  bv to national semiconductor corporation for million in cash 
this transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
the company acquired its shares of sitel sierra  bv  a joint venture with tritech microelectronics pte 
ltd 
of singapore  in in exchange for the contribution of a license to certain technology owned by the company and certain assets of sierra semiconductor bv provision for income taxes 
the income tax provision reflects the effect of a nondeductible million charge for the purchase of in process research and development relating to the bit  inc acquisition and taxes on foreign operations 
the us taxes are reduced by the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the recorded modem chipset business restructure charge of million did not result in a tax benefit because of the uncertainty of future us income as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
the income tax provision reflects the effect of a nondeductible million charge for the pmc purchase price adjustment 
the income tax provision reflects the effect of a nondeductible million charge for purchase of in process research and development and taxes on foreign operations 
discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of  the company and its board of directors reached a decision to offer prometheus products  inc for sale and  as a result  it has been reported as a discontinued operation in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded a million discontinued operations charge to write down the assets and accrue additional liabilities including a provision for future losses from operations expected to be incurred during the sales process 
the company contracted with an investment banking firm in the first quarter of to engage in efforts to sell prometheus 
the effort to sell prometheus has not resulted in a sale and the company has subsequently completed the closure of most operations of prometheus  except for the hardware and software technical support function which provides product warranty support for the installed base of products previously sold 
all liabilities and operating results of prometheus for have been recorded against the discontinued operations provision established in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources 
the company s cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased from million at december  to million at december  during the company made payments of approximately million to reduce debt and for capital lease obligations primarily related to foundry agreements for future production capacity  million for the purchase of fixed assets  and million for equity investments in other companies 
these uses of cash were partially offset by cash sources of approximately million from operating activities and million from the issuance of common stock principally under the company s stock option and purchase plans 
the uses of cash for operating activities were a net loss of million  an increase in inventory purchased of million  a reduction in accounts payable of million  an increase in deposits for wafer capacity of million  million net change in restructure liabilities third quarter restructure  and a million change in net liabilities of discontinued operations prometheus 
the primary offsetting sources of cash from operating activities were a non cash restructure charge of million for the company s exit from the modem chipset business and the associated restructuring of its non networking operations  a decrease of million in accounts receivable balances  million of non cash depreciation expense  a non cash in process research and development charge of million for the acquisition of technology and other assets from bit  inc  and the receipt of proceeds of million in the first quarter of from the sale of sitel sierra bv in the fourth quarter of as of december   the company had available a line of credit with a bank under which the company may borrow up to million with interest at the bank s prime rate at december  
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit 
at december   a million standby letter of credit was outstanding under the line of credit 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of the restructure charge  the company s line of credit agreement with the bank was renegotiated to allow the company to borrow up to million under the line of credit  provided that each borrowing is fully cash secured 
the agreement requires the company to maintain  on a quarterly basis  minimum cash equal to three times the then current outstanding principal balance of the term loan 
the agreement prohibits dividend payments without the bank s prior written consent and other major transactions except that the company may i acquire other companies using up to million in cash  ii enter into off balance sheet equipment leases  not to exceed million in the aggregate  and iii issue convertible securities with subordination provisions satisfactory to the bank 
the agreement expires on july  as of december  and  the company was in compliance with all of its covenants 
the company believes that existing sources of liquidity and anticipated funds from operations will satisfy the company s projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the end of the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  among others  the extent to which the company pursues additional wafer fabrication capacity from existing foundry suppliers or new suppliers  product development  and acquisitions of complimentary businesses  products or technologies 
from time to time the company may explore strategic investment opportunities which may require funds in excess of currently available sources of liquidity 
accordingly  the company may choose to raise needed funds from debt and or equity financings
