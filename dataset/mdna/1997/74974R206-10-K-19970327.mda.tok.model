item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview rtw  inc rtw or the company was organized in to provide workers compensation management products and services to employers 
in  the company began offering its workers compensation management services combined with workers compensation insurance products provided by an unaffiliated insurance company 
under its arrangement with this insurance company  rtw was responsible for marketing and administering the insurance company s workers compensation insurance policies and was compensated on a fee for service basis 
in  rtw phased out its agreement with this insurance company and began offering workers compensation management services combined with insurance underwritten by its wholly owned subsidiary american compensation insurance company acic 
the ability to underwrite insurance allowed the company to directly benefit from the use of its proprietary methods in reducing workers compensation costs and afforded rtw more control over its customers workers compensation programs 
the company s premiums in force grew to million at the end of from million at the end of and million at the end of rtw currently provides workers compensation management services solely to employers insured through acic 
the company s revenues consist of premiums earned and investment income 
premiums earned during a period are the gross premiums earned by the company on outstanding workers compensation policies less the amount of any premiums ceded to reinsurers 
acic ceded  on a pro rata basis  a portion of its insurance business to reliance insurance company reliance  an unaffiliated reinsurance company  under which reliance assumed of the and of the and claim and claim settlement expenses in consideration for a proportionate share of eligible premiums 
in addition  the company received a fee from reliance for claims administration  which the company applied to reduce its claim and claim settlement expenses 
the company entered into this quota share reinsurance agreement because it enabled the company to provide management services and workers compensation insurance products to a greater number of customers than its capital and surplus would have otherwise allowed 
as a consequence of additions to acic s capital and surplus from the net proceeds of the company s senior note offering in and its initial public offering in  the company determined that it no longer required quota share reinsurance to expand its operations and terminated the agreement for and subsequent years 
the company also cedes a portion of its premiums for excess of loss reinsurance coverage that limits the company s per incident exposure 
if reliance or any of the company s excess of loss reinsurers are unable to meet any of their obligations to the company under their reinsurance policies  the company would be responsible for the payment of all claim and claim settlement expenses covered by the workers compensation policies that the company had underwritten  including those expenses covered by reinsurance 
the company is not aware of any developments with respect to any of its reinsurers that would prevent them from honoring any of their obligations to the company 
investment income represents the earnings on the company s investment portfolio 
the company s expenses are comprised of claim and claim settlement expenses  policy acquisition costs  general and administrative expenses  interest expense and income taxes 
claim and claim settlement expenses include payments and reserves for future payments for medical care and rehabilitation costs  indemnity costs for lost wages and third party claim settlement expenses such as independent medical examinations  surveillance costs and legal expenses  second injury fund charges based on claim outcomes  as well as staff and related expenses incurred to administer and settle claims 
because the company has limited historical data for use in its estimates of unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses  the company has used industry data to supplement its experience in determining the reserve for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses 
as a result of the use of industry data  the ultimate amount of unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses recognized by the company may differ from the amount estimated 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
policy acquisition costs consist of agents commissions  premium taxes  certain state administrative and second injury fund charges based on premiums and underwriting and marketing expenses  offset by any ceding commissions received from reliance 
ceding commissions consist of provisional ceding commissions paid to the company by reliance for adjustments based on actual claim and claim settlement expenses related to premiums ceded in prior years 
under the reinsurance agreement  the company s ceding commission is adjusted to the extent that actual claim and claim settlement expenses vary from levels specified in the agreement 
results of operations the relationship of total revenues to each item in the statement of income varies from period to period due  in part  to the fact that the company did not have a quota share reinsurance agreement in effect in and  whereas  the company had a quota share reinsurance agreement in effect in the absence of a quota share reinsurance agreement in and increased premiums earned as a percent of gross premiums earned

the company expects commission expense as a percent of gross premiums earned to increase during premium tax expense increased slightly to of gross premiums earned in from of gross premiums earned in and due to higher premium tax rates paid in colorado 
the company expects premium tax expense as a percent of gross premiums earned in to remain consistent with other policy acquisition costs increased to of gross premiums earned in from in and in  due to increased focus on marketing programs as the company expands into new states and continues to grow in its more established markets and increased personnel costs necessary for the growth in premiums in force

the company generates positive net cash from operations due  in part  to the timing differences between the receipt of premiums and the payment of claim and claim settlement expenses 
cash is invested pending future payments for such expenses as indemnity  medical benefits and other operating expenses 
the company s investment portfolio currently consists of us treasury and agency securities 
cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of u 
s 
treasury or agency securities acquired under repurchase agreements with maturities of days or less  with the remaining balances in cash and a money market fund that invests in short term government securities 
cash provided by operating activities in was million 
this is primarily a result of the company s net income of million  an increase of million in unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses which are non cash accruals for future claims  and an increase of million in unearned premiums  net of premiums receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was million  primarily the result of purchases of million of available for sale securities  million of maturities of held to maturity securities and million purchases of furniture and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was million  primarily due to payments totaling million on outstanding senior notes and series a and b notes in december the company s investments increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily from cash provided by operating activities 
of the company s investments at december   million were classified as held to maturity and valued at amortized cost  while million were classified as available for sale and valued at fair value 
all of the company s investment securities at december  were u 
s 
treasury and agency securities 
of the held to maturity securities  million had remaining maturities of one to five years and million had maturities of five to ten years see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s current investment policy is to invest only in us treasury and agency securities  and it does not invest in derivative securities 
historically  changes in market interest rates have caused fluctuations in the fair value of securities 
during  the company invested solely in available for sale securities and intends to continue this investment strategy for the foreseeable future 
additionally  the company intends to broaden its investment policy during to increase investment income consistent with prudent risk 
as a result of the increased holdings in securities classified as available for sale  and thus carried at fair value  the company expects increased volatility in shareholders equity as market interest rates and other factors change 
the company s need for additional capital is primarily the result of regulations which require certain ratios of capital to premiums written 
in order for acic to begin operations  the company had to raise capital and contribute it to acic 
as acic grew  additional capital was required to support the higher premium levels 
as a result  the company raised approximately million in april through an initial public offering and million in january through the issuance of senior notes and contributed million in and million in to acic 
in the future  the company expects that its need for additional capital will be primarily related to the growth of acic and the need to maintain appropriate capital to premium ratios as defined by state regulatory bodies 
as an alternative to raising additional capital  the company believes it could secure quota share or other reinsurance which would have the effect of reducing the ratio of premiums to capital and could be used to satisfy state regulatory requirements 
the company entered into its reinsurance agreements with reliance during  and for that purpose 
state insurance regulations limit distributions  including dividends  from acic to the company 
the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by acic to the company in any year is equal to the lesser of i of acic s statutory surplus as of the end of the previous fiscal year  or ii the statutory net gain from operations not including realized capital gains of acic in its most recent fiscal year 
based on this limitation  the maximum dividend that acic could pay to the company in  without regulatory approval  is approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
acic may be subject to more restrictive limitations on dividends as it enters additional states 
acic has never paid a dividend to the company and  for the foreseeable future  the company intends to retain capital in acic to enable the company to expand its operations 
the company believes that cash flow generated by its operations and its cash and investment balances will be sufficient to fund continuing operations  principal repayments and debt service on its outstanding senior notes and capital expenditures for the next months 
on january   the minnesota workers compensation reinsurance association  of which acic is required to be a member  declared a refund of approximately million to its insured members 
the method of calculating the refund and the amount of the refund must be approved by the minnesota department of commerce 
the company can not quantify  at this time  the amount of refund  if any  that it will receive 
naic risk based capital standards the national association of insurance commissioners naic has recently adopted risk based capital standards to determine the capital requirements of a property and casualty insurance carrier based upon the risks inherent in its operations 
such standards require the computation of a risk based capital amount which is then compared to a carrier s actual total adjusted capital 
the computation involves applying factors to various financial data to address four primary risks asset risk  insurance underwriting risk  credit risk and off balance sheet risk 
these standards provide for regulatory intervention when the percent of total adjusted capital to authorized control level risk based capital is below certain levels 
based upon the risk based capital standards  the company s percent of total adjusted capital is substantially in excess of authorized control level risk based capital 
regulation the company s insurance subsidiary is subject to substantial regulation by the governmental agencies in the states in which it operates  and will be subject to such regulation in any state in which it provides workers compensation products and services in the future 
state regulatory agencies have broad administrative power with respect to all aspects of the business of the company and its insurance subsidiary  including premium rates  benefit levels  policy forms  dividend payments  capital adequacy and the amount and type of investments 
these regulations are primarily intended to protect covered employees and policyholders rather than the insurance company 
both the legislation covering insurance companies and the regulations adopted by state agencies are subject to change 
the company s insurance subsidiary is currently licensed to do business in minnesota  colorado  missouri  michigan  massachusetts  pennsylvania and illinois 
the naic is in the process of codifying statutory accounting principles 
the ultimate completion date and impact of this project on current statutory policies and practices is unknown
