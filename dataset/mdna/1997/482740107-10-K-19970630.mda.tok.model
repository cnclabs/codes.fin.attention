it is not meaningful to compare changing prices over the past three years because the products  product formulas  product mix and sources of raw materials have varied substantially 
the company has transitioned its revenue structure from one based on lower margin  highly competitive  short term contract manufacturing to focusing on higher margin  drug delivery product marketing through ethex corporation and particle dynamics  inc  its wholly owned subsidiaries  as well as advanced technology drug delivery products to be marketed and co marketed under long term licensing agreements 
these advanced technology drug delivery products and systems are the subject of a number of long term business arrangements and provide differentiated and or improved benefits derived from incorporating kv s drug delivery system technologies 
for the most part  these products can be produced with existing manufacturing processes 
the company expects to continue a relatively high level of expenditures and investment for research  clinical and regulatory efforts relating to the development and commercialization of proprietary new products and advanced technology products and their approval for marketing 
the implementation of these strategies of focusing on drug delivery technology distinguished product marketing capabilities through its ethex and particle dynamics  inc subsidiaries and drug delivery licensing arrangements with brand pharmaceutical marketing clients has allowed the company to de emphasize contract services 
consequently  the company has shifted its future growth internally  with drug delivery product marketing capabilities and drug delivery licensing activities constituting of kv s total business the company believes funds generated from operating activities and existing cash  together with the funds available under its new credit facility and the funds provided from licensing agreements will be adequate to fund the company s requirements for short term needs due to the continued sales growth being experienced
