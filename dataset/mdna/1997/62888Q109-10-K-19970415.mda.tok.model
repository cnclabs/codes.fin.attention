revenues from product sales were limited to sales of specialty products and prototypes 
in  the company received approximately of its operating revenues from engineering and development funding  compared with in since  revenues from product sales have generally been increasing  although in product sales declined due to delays in production and reduced pricing of certain products 
management expects that technology licensing fees  royalties and product sales will become the principal source of the company s revenue as the commercialization of its technology proceeds 
as a result of the acquisition of certain anvt assets  the company became the exclusive licensee of ten seminal patents  the chaplin patents  through its wholly owned subsidiary  cph 
the company s ability to license the chaplin patents directly to unaffiliated third parties provides the company with a greater ability to earn technology licensing fees and royalties from such patents 
further  the company believes that its intellectual property portfolio prevents other competitors and potential competitors in the field of active wave managementtm from participating in certain commercial areas without licenses from the company 
notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section which follows describe the current status of the company s available cash balances and the uncertainties which exist that raise substantial doubt as to the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
as previously disclosed  the company implemented changes in its organization and focus in late additionally  in late the company redefined its corporate mission to be the worldwide leader in the advancement and commercialization of active wave managementtm technology 
active wave managementtm is the electronic and or mechanical manipulation of sound or signal waves to reduce noise  improve signal to noise ratio and or enhance sound quality 
this redefinition is the result of the development of new technologies  as previously noted  such as asftm  tdsstm  fpttm  and the smm  which create products that the company believes will be utilized in areas beyond noise and vibration reduction and control 
these technologies and products are consistent with shifting the company s focus to technology licensing fees  royalties and products that represent near term revenue generation 
the redefinition of corporate mission is reflected in the revised business plan which the company began to implement in the first quarter of as distribution channels are established and as product sales and market acceptance and awareness of the commercial applications of active wave managementtm build as anticipated by management  revenues from technology licensing fees  royalties and product sales are forecasted to fund an increasing share of the company s requirements 
the funding from these sources  if realized  will reduce the company s dependence on engineering and development funding 
the beginning of this process is shown in the shifting percentages of operating revenue  discussed below 
in january  the company adopted a plan that management believed would generate sufficient funds for the company to continue its operations into under this plan  as amended  the company needed to generate approximately million to fund its operations for the company believed that it could generate these funds from operations in  and the additional cash funding obtained from sales of common stock refer to notes and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company did not meet its revenue targets for success in generating technology licensing fees  royalties and product sales are significant and critical to the company s ability to overcome its present financial difficulties 
the company cannot predict whether it will be successful in obtaining market acceptance of its new products or in completing its current negotiations with respect to licenses and royalty revenues 
from the company s inception through december   its operating revenues  including technology licensing fees and royalties  product sales and engineering and development services  have consisted of approximately product sales  engineering and development services and technology licensing fees 
the company has entered into a number of alliances and strategic relationships with established firms for the integration of its technology into products 
the speed with which the company can achieve the commercialization of its technology depends in large part upon the time taken by these firms and their customers for product testing  and their assessment of how best to integrate the technology into their products and into their manufacturing operations 
while the company works with these firms on product testing and integration  it is not always able to influence how quickly this process can be completed 
the company began shipping proactivetm headsets in and continues to sell noisebuster tm consumer headsets 
the company is now selling products through three of its alliances walker is manufacturing and selling industrial silencers  siemens is buying and contracting with the company to install quieting headsets for patient use in siemens mri machines  and in the fourth quarter of ultra began installing production model aircraft cabin quieting systems in the saab turboprop aircraft 
management believes these developments and those previously disclosed help demonstrate the range of commercial potential for the company s technology and will contribute to the company s transition from engineering and development to technology licensing fees  royalties and product sales 
the availability of high quality  low cost electronic components for integration into the company s products also is critical to the commercialization of the company s technology 
the company is working with its strategic partners and other suppliers to reduce the size and cost of the company s systems  so that the company will be able to offer low cost electronics and other components suitable for high volume production 
the company has continued to make substantial investments in its technology and intellectual property and has incurred development costs for engineering prototypes  pre production models and field testing of several products 
during  the company acquired a license to two patents in the field of micro machined microphones and concluded the acquisition of all of the patents  know how and intellectual property of a former competitor  anvt 
management believes that the company s investment in its technology has resulted in the expansion of its intellectual property portfolio and improvement in the functionality  speed and cost of components and products 
the company has become certified under the international standards organization product quality program known as iso  and has successfully undergone two quality audits 
since the third quarter of  the company has reduced its worldwide work force by from to current employees as of march  because the company did not met its revenue targets for  it entered into certain transactions  which provided additional funding as follows on march   the company sold  shares of its common stock in a private placement that provided net proceeds to the company of million 
the purchaser of the common stock was subject to certain resale and transfer restrictions including those under regulation d of the securities act of  as amended

such a registration statement was declared effective by the commission on september  on april   the company sold  shares  in the aggregate  of its common stock to three institutional investors in a private placement that provided net proceeds to the company of million 
contemporaneously  the company sold secured convertible term notes in the aggregate principal amount of million to those institutional investors and granted them each an option to purchase an aggregate of million of additional shares of the company s common stock

the relevant agreements provide for significant monetary penalties in the event such registration statement is not declared effective on or before november   and in the event its effectiveness is suspended for other than brief permissible periods 
however  the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on september  on august   the company sold million shares of its common stock to the same foreign investor which purchased million shares of the company s common stock in november  the company received million of net proceeds 
the purchaser is subject to certain resale and transfer restrictions with respect to these shares

subject to certain common stock resale restrictions  the investor  at its discretion  would be able to convert the principal and interest due on the debentures into the company s common stock at any time on or after january  in the event of such a conversion  the conversion price would be the lesser of of the closing bid price of the company s common stock on the closing date or of the average closing bid price for the five trading days immediately preceding the conversion 
to provide for the above noted conversion and interest payment options  the company would  at closing  reserve and subsequently cause to be deposited with an escrow agent million shares of the company s common stock 
subject to certain conditions  the company also had the right to require the investor to convert all or part of the debentures under the above noted conversion price conditions after february  subsequent to the closing date of the above financing  the company was to use its best efforts to carry out the necessary actions to effect at least a reverse split of the company s common stock 
the november financing was not completed as described above 
the company increased the aggregate amount of debentures offered to million and obtained subscriptions for million of such amount  of which million was completed with five investors that are different than the investor described above  between january  and march   which resulted in net proceeds to the company of million 
an additional million of debentures has been subscribed for by one investor is to close after that investor converts million of its current holdings of million of debentures into common stock of the company 
the terms of the debentures are similar to those described above  but the conversion price  if the average bid price of the stock for the five days preceding conversion is used as the basis for computing conversion  ranges from to of that price and there is no requirement that the company use its best efforts to carry out the necessary actions to effect at least a reverse split of the company s common stock 
management believes that the funding provided by increased product sales  technology licensing fees  royalties  and cost savings  if realized  coupled with the additional capital referred to above  should enable the company to continue operations into if the company is not able to realize such increased technology licensing fees  royalties and product sales  or generate additional capital  it will have to further cut its level of operations substantially in order to conserve cash

agreements with joint venture and other strategic partners generally require that a portion of the initial cash flows  if any  generated by the ventures or alliances be paid on a preferential basis to the company s co venturers until the license fees and engineering and development funds provided to the venture or the company are recovered 
in january  the company adopted a plan that management believes should generate sufficient funds for the company to continue its operations into under this plan  the company needs to generate approximately million to fund its operations in included in such amount is approximately million in sales of new products and approximately million of technology licensing fees and royalties 
the company believes that it can generate these funds from operations and the sale of the debentures referred to above  although there is no certainty that the company will achieve this goal 
while the company has exceeded its expectations to date in regarding technology licensing fees  production delays have slowed new product sales 
success in generating technology licensing fees  royalties and product sales are significant and critical to the company s ability to overcome its present financial difficulties 
the company cannot predict whether it will be successful in obtaining market acceptance of its new products or in completing its current negotiations with respect to licenses and royalty revenues 
if  during the course of  management of the company determines that it will be unable to meet or exceed the plan discussed above  the company will consider additional financing alternatives 
the company s ability to raise additional capital through sales of common stock will be severely limited until the company s stockholders approve an amendment to the company s certificate of incorporation authorizing an increase in its authorized capital stock 
the company will monitor its performance against the plan on a monthly basis and  if necessary  reduce its level of operations accordingly 
the company believes that the plan discussed above constitutes a viable plan for the continuation of the company s business into there can be no assurance that additional funding will be provided by technology licensing fees  royalties  product sales  engineering and development revenue or additional capital 
in that event  the company would have to further cut back its level of operations substantially in order to conserve cash 
these reductions could have an adverse effect on the company s relations with its strategic partners and customers 
the uncertainty with respect to the adequacy of current funds to support the company s activities until positive cash flow from operations can be achieved  and with respect to the availability of financing from other sources to fund any cash deficiencies  raises substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
further discussion of these uncertainties is presented in notes and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   cash and short term investments were  the available resources were invested in interest bearing money market accounts 
the company s investment objective is preservation of capital while earning a moderate rate of return 
the company s working capital decreased from  at december   to  as of december  this decrease was due primarily to the revenue shortfall discussed above 
during  the net cash used in operating activities was million 
this utilization reflects the emphasis on the commercial development of its technology into several product applications which were scheduled for introduction in and net inventory declined during by  primarily reflecting sales of the original noisebustertm product 
during the year ended december   accounts receivable reserves were increased by  as the company wrote off certain accounts and added certain amounts to its reserves 
the company s available cash balances at december  are lower than projected at the end of  primarily due to the revenue shortfall noted above 
the net cash used in investing activities amounted to  during the year primarily for capital expenditures 
the net cash provided by financing activities amounted to  primarily from the exercise of options and warrants and the private placements noted above 
the company has no lines of credit with banks or other lending institutions and therefore has no unused borrowing capacity 
the company believes that the level of financial resources available to it is an essential competitive factor 
the company may elect to raise additional capital  from time to time  through equity or debt financing in order to capitalize on business opportunities and market conditions although the company s ability to raise additional capital through sales of common stock will be severely limited until the company s stockholders approve an amendment to the company s certificate of incorporation authorizing additional capital stock 
capital expenditures the company intends to continue its business strategy of working with supply  manufacturing  distribution and marketing partners to commercialize its technology 
the benefits of this strategy include i dependable sources of electronic and other components  which leverages on their purchasing power  provides important cost savings and accesses the most advanced technologies  ii utilization of the manufacturing capacity of the company s allies  enabling the company to integrate its active technology into products with limited capital investment  and iii access to well established channels of distribution and marketing capability of leaders in several market segments 
there were no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december   and no material commitments are anticipated in the near future
