ebdt 
the company defines earnings before depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes ebdt as net earnings from operations before depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes on income  and excludes provision for decline in real estate  gain loss on disposition of properties and extraordinary gains 
the company excludes depreciation and amortization expense from ebdt because they are non cash items and the company believes the values of its properties have appreciated over time in excess of their original cost 
deferred income taxes are excluded because they are a non cash item 
payment of current income taxes has not been historically significant and is not expected to be significant in the foreseeable future 
the provision for the decline in real estate is excluded from ebdt because it is typically a non cash item that varies from year to year based on factors unrelated to the company s overall financial performance 
the company excludes gain loss on the disposition of properties from ebdt because it develops and acquires properties for long term investment  as opposed to short term trading gains

with respect to taxable variable rate debt  the company generally attempts to obtain interest rate protection for such debt with a maturity in excess of one year 
of the  in taxable variable rate debt outstanding at february    was protected by interest rate swaps with a weighted average rate of and an average remaining term of years  effectively reducing the company s interest rate exposure from the taxable variable rate debt to  in addition   of variable rate debt was protected by interest rate caps  of which  extends for more than one year
