during the fiscal year ended february   the company recorded  net orders home sales contracted for less cancellations  which was homes higher than fiscal year the company had homes in its backlog homes under contract but not closed at february   which was an increase of homes over the company s backlog at february  liquidity and capital resources the company s principal cash requirements are for the acquisition  development  construction  marketing and overhead of its projects 
the need to stage the acquisition and use of raw materials such as land and finished lots and the need  on certain projects  to construct community facilities ahead of the start of home construction requires homebuilders such as the company to commit working capital for longer periods than many traditional manufacturing companies 
when building inventory  the company uses substantial amounts of cash that are generally obtained from borrowings  available cash flow from operations and partners contributions to joint ventures 
the company has principally used secured recourse and non recourse bank financing  bond financing and financing provided by an advisor to calpers and other joint venture partners for overhead  acquisition  development and construction financing for individual projects or phases of projects 
in may  the company completed the sale of  of senior notes including  warrants to purchase common stock 
the proceeds from the offering were used to repay certain debt of the company  acquire certain properties and for general working capital and construction purposes 
the proceeds are projected to provide sufficient available liquidity  when combined with additional financing permitted under the indenture  joint ventures and cash flow from operations  to fund the company s current and projected acquisition  development and construction activities

the credit agreements contain certain covenants  including covenants that require the company to comply with certain operating and reporting requirements and maintain certain financial levels and ratios 
the credit agreements also define certain events that constitute events of default 
the bank is entitled to payments out of the proceeds of its collateral prior to any holders of unsecured indebtedness  including the notes 
durable and clark wilson also have non recourse lines of credit to facilitate construction activity 
durable has subsequent to the end of fiscal year secured a million non recourse line of credit to replace its existing million non recourse line 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at prime plus one and one quarter percent 
clark wilson has secured several non recourse lines of credit in the aggregate amount of million

clark wilson is currently negotiating extensions on all facilities due within one year 
subsequent to february   the company s arizona operation secured a million non recourse line of credit 
the indenture contains restrictions on the incurring of indebtedness which affect the availability of these bank facilities based on various measures of the financial performance of the company 
subject to such restrictions  the bank facilities will be available to augment cash flow from operations  joint venture funds and the proceeds of the offering to fund the company s operations 
company credit facilities millions amount amount borrower as of february  as of may  company recourse recourse company non recourse non recourse company non recourse non recourse clark wilson non recourse non recourse durable non recourse non recourse arizona non recourse total interest rates and inflation the long term impact of inflation on the company is manifested in increased land prices  land development  construction and overhead costs balanced by increased sales prices 
the company generally contracts for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin and  accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes may affect the company s profits 
since the sales prices of homes are fixed at the time of sale and the company generally sells its homes prior to commencement of construction  any inflation of construction costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
the company generally attempts to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
housing demand  in general  is adversely affected by increases in interest costs  as well as materials and other costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect the company s interest costs 
if the company is unable to duplicate its past ability to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance a home purchase  the company s revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford a new home 
asset impairment charges operating results during fiscal year were adversely affected by asset impairment charges totaling  related to the write off of operational start up costs for the company s operations in arizona  the write off of certain redesign and materials costs previously capitalized to certain low margin projects in nevada and certain other costs 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 earnings per share  which is required to be adopted by the company on february  at that time  the company will be required to change the method used to compute earnings per share and to restate all prior periods presented 
under the new requirements primary earnings per share will be replaced with basic earnings per share 
basic earnings per share excludes the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents  including stock options 
had earnings per share been calculated under the provisions of the new standard  both basic and diluted earnings per share would be the same as net income per share as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each of the three years in the period ended february
