the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the financial statements and notes 
historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period 
overview gtsi is the largest dedicated reseller of microcomputer and unix workstation hardware  software and networking products to the government 
the company currently offers access to over  information technology products from more than manufacturers 
gtsi also performs network integration services  including configuring  installing and maintaining microcomputers in local area networks 
the company sells to virtually all departments and agencies of the government  many state governments and several hundred systems integrators and prime contractors that sell to the government market 
gtsi offers its customers a convenient and cost effective centralized source for microcomputer and workstation products through its competitive pricing  broad product selection and procurement expertise 
the company provides its vendors with a low cost marketing and distribution channel to the millions of end users comprising the government market  while virtually insulating these vendors from most of the complex government procurement rules and regulations 
changes in sales throughout the company s history have been attributable to increased or decreased unit sales  to expansion of the company s product offerings eg  peripherals  microcomputers and networking and workstation products  from through  to the addition of new vendors eg  ibm  sun  panasonic  apple and nexar  from through  and to the addition or expiration of sales contract vehicles eg  the addition of the desktop iv contract  the sewp i contract  the nih contract and the tda contract from through  and the expiration of the companion contract in and desktop iv systems ordering in 
the company s financial results have fluctuated seasonally  and may continue to do so in the future  because of the government s buying patterns which have historically favorably impacted the last two calendar quarters and adversely affected the first two calendar quarters 
the company s primary strategy is to focus on its core gsa schedule business and to compete aggressively on bids in order to win as many contract vehicles as possible under the various purchasing programs available to it in the government market 
with those contract vehicles in place  it is then possible for the company to use its significant product base and marketing knowledge to sell products which both meet customers requirements and provide an attractive financial return to the company

compared with sales 
sales consist of revenues from product shipments and services rendered net of allowances for customer returns and credits 
during  sales decreased million or 
decreases in sales under idiq contracts and sales from other contracts of million and million  respectively  were partially offset by increased open market sales and sales under gsa schedule contracts 
the increase in open market sales primarily resulted from the inclusion of million of ibm label product originally purchased for sale under the company s desktop iv contract which was commercialized and sold via the open market during the first six months of if this product had been sold under the desktop iv contract as originally intended  open market sales in would have declined million when compared to the prior year 
it is manage ment s belief that the decline in open market sales is primarily attributable to recent changes in the procurement regulations that allow the government to purchase products by other means eg  gsa schedule contracts in a quicker and easier manner than was the case before such changes 
sales under idiq contracts declined during primarily as a result of decreased sales under the company s desktop iv contract and the lack of sales under the companion contract which expired september  of million and million  respectively 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in sales under the company s nih contract of million and its sewp contract of million 
other new contracts procured by the company during took longer than expected to be awarded and  upon award to the company  did not generate sufficient revenue to offset the declining sales under contracts which had ended or were near completion 
the slight increase in sales under the company s gsa schedule contracts was primarily comprised of million of increased gsa schedule b c sales offset by a decline in sales under gsa schedule a of million 
during  there were no sales of the company s private label hardware  which was introduced in under the desktop iv contract a decrease of 
additionally  sales of apple products decreased approximately million 
these decreases were partially offset by sales of microsoft and panasonic products which increased approximately and  respectively  from million to million and from million to million  respectively 
sales of ibm label products also increased during from million to million primarily as a result of the company s inclusion of this product on its desktop iv contract 
as noted above  million of this product was ultimately sold via the open market during the first six months of during the period from august  date of the falcon acquisition to september   the number of employees exceeded applicable size standards necessary to qualify the company as a small business 
although the company cannot precisely quantify the specific effect of this change on its operations  it is believed that sales were negatively impacted during the period in which the company was not a qualified small business 
beginning september   the company once again began to compete for opportunities exclusively reserved for small business non manufacturers 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  the executive and legislative branches of the government could not agree on a budget for fiscal year although the company cannot precisely quantify the specific effect of the government s work stoppage on the company s operations  it is believed that sales were negatively impacted during these periods 
backlog at december   was approximately million  up from approximately million at december  backlog was million at february  gross margin 
gross margin is sales less cost of sales which includes product purchase cost  freight and certain other overhead expenses related to the cost of acquiring products 
over the last seven years  gtsi has experienced lower gross margin percentages because of pressure on end user prices caused by the leverage of government agencies and other customers in negotiating low prices  the increasing maturation and shorter life cycles of leading microcomputer hardware and software products which causes customers to focus on price as the primary distinguishing factor among sellers of such products  and the use of low prices by competitors as the primary means to obtain government market share 
in addition  idiq contracts are complex and require service procured by the company during took longer than expected to be awarded expenses  including warranty support and software upgrades 
gross margin percentages vary over time and change significantly depending on the contract vehicle and product involved  therefore  the company s overall gross margin percentages are dependent on the mix and timing of products sold and the strategic use of contract vehicles that are available to sell its products 
gross margin decreased in by approximately million or  and decreased as a percentage of sales from to 
the decrease in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to lower sales volume and adjustments of approximately million recorded by the company in the fourth quarter of such adjustments were deemed necessary to provide for contractual obligations  and to reduce certain trade credits to the amounts ultimately expected to be realized 
these adjustments were also the primary reason for the decline in gross margin percentage 
other factors that contributed to the decline in gross margin percentage during include the open market sale of near obsolete inventory noted above which earned little or no gross margin  a large drop shipment of product from one of the company s vendors directly to the customer at a lower than normal margin  several large software orders and the increased concentration of sales under the gsa schedule b c 
gsa schedule b c sales accounted for of sales as compared with of sales 
in  these sales earned margins lower than other company sales 
operating expenses 
operating expenses in increased approximately million  or  and increased as a percentage of sales from to 
this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in amortization expense associated with the accelerated write down of intangible assets which was recognized during the fourth quarter of this change was offset by decreases in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable  personnel expenses and expenses for contracted services 
restructuring charge 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a million restructuring charge million after tax  or per share

on august   a cpu extension for  units re opened this contract for ordering by the air force until its completion on february  sales under the companion contract decreased million  or  from  primarily due to its expiration on september  these decreases were partially offset by increased sales on the portable and sewp contracts which were up million and million  respectively

the decrease in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to lower sales volume and adjustments of approximately million recorded by the company in the fourth quarter of such adjustments were deemed necessary to provide for contractual obligations  and to reduce selected inventory products to the lower of cost or market values 
these adjustments were also the primary reason for the decline in gross margin percentage

gtsi s effective tax rate was in new accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by the company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
this statement requires that companies determine the fair value for all stock based compensation using one of several option pricing models and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  effect of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its operations 
however  in the event inflation increases in the future it could at least temporarily adversely affect the profitability of gtsi s sales under its government fixed price contracts  which generally preclude the company from passing on inflation related or other increases in product costs to government customers during the term of a pre existing contract 
the company mitigates this risk in part by often obtaining agreements from certain of its suppliers prohibiting them from increasing their prices to gtsi during fixed price  term contracts 
seasonal fluctuations and other factors the company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in its operations as a result of government buying and funding patterns  which also impact the buying patterns of gtsi s prime contractor customers 
these buying and funding patterns historically have had a significant positive effect on gtsi s bookings in the third quarter ending september each year the government s fiscal year end  and consequently on sales and net income in the third and fourth quarters of each year 
quarterly financial results are also affected by the timing of the award of and shipments of products under government contracts  price competition in the microcomputer and workstation industries  the addition of personnel or other expenses in anticipation of sales growth  product line changes and expansions  and the timing and costs of changes in customer and product mix 
in addition  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new product releases by leading microcomputer and workstation hardware and software manufacturers  delays in vendor shipments of new or existing products  a shift in sales mix to more complex requirements contracts with more complex service costs  and vendor delays in the processing of incentives and credits due gtsi  have occurred all of which are also likely to occur in the future and have adversely affected the company s operating performance in particular periods 
the seasonality and the unpredictability of the factors affecting such seasonality make gtsi s quarterly and yearly financial results difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuation 
the company s stock price could be adversely affected if any such financial results fail to meet the financial community s expectations 
additionally  legislation is periodically introduced in congress that may change the government s procurement practices 
gtsi cannot predict whether any legislative or any regulatory proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  the impact upon its operating results 
changes in the structure  composition and or buying patterns of the government  either alone or in combination with competitive conditions or other factors  could adversely affect future results 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company generated million of cash flow from operations  as compared to million for the year ended december  most of the increase from year to year relates to a significant reduction in net operating assets accounts receivable plus merchandise inventories less accounts payable 
after reduction of approximately million of capital expenditures  approximately million for equipment and leasehold improvements related to the company s new distribution center and approximately million related to the company s new financial information system  the operation of which began on january  from the net cash provided by operating activities  overall short term notes payable to banks decreased million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company began negotiations with a bank principal lender and other lenders other lenders collectively  lenders to form a new lending syndicate to obtain a million credit facility 
on december   the company executed an interim credit agreement interim agreement with the principal lender for million and an intercreditor agreement with the company s prior bank prior lender for an additional million decreasing to million on february  and expiring on february  
this intercreditor agreement with the prior lender included terms and conditions similar to those existing under the previous credit facility with the prior lending syndicate 
on march   the company and its principal lender executed amendment no 
to the interim agreement which modified certain financial covenants 
on may   the company executed a three year credit facility with the principal lender for million and a one year credit facility with the other lenders for an additional million collectively  the credit facility  replacing the interim agreement 
additionally  on june   the company executed a separate million facility with the principal lender for inventory financing of vendor products 
interest under the inventory financing facility is accrued at a rate equal to prime plus at december  
at june   the company was not in compliance with two covenants contained in the credit facility 
on august   the company s lenders agreed to waive compliance with the june  application of these covenants 
on august   the company and its lenders executed amendment no 
to the credit facility  which modified certain financial covenants 
at december   the unused portion of the credit facility was million 
interest under the credit facility is payable quarterly and is accrued at a rate equal to the london interbank offered rate libor plus at december  
borrowing is limited to of eligible accounts receivable 
the credit facility is substantially collateralized by all of the operating assets of the company 
current obligations are first funded and then all cash receipts are automatically applied to reduce outstanding borrowings 
the credit facility also contains certain covenants  including restrictions on the payment of dividends and repurchase of stock  and provisions specifying compliance with certain financial ratios 
at december   the company was not in compliance with the earnings before interest and taxes and tangible net worth covenants contained in the credit facility 
although the principal lender has the right to discontinue making any new loans and to call the outstanding loan  such principal lender has continued to provide financing to the company under the existing credit facility 
all amounts due to the lenders as of december  are classified as current liabilities 
the company anticipates that it will continue to rely primarily on operating cash flow  bank loans and vendor credit to finance its reasonably anticipated cash needs 
such funds should be sufficient to satisfy the company s near term anticipated cash requirements for operations 
nonetheless  the company may seek additional sources of capital  including permanent financing over a longer term at fixed rates  to finance its requirements 
the company currently has no reason to believe that such capital sources will not be available to it on acceptable terms  if needed 
the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding reflects the issuance of  shares of common stock sold by the company in its initial public offering  and the effect of outstanding option and warrant transactions to date
