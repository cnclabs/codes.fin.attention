inflation most of the retail tenant leases at the shopping center properties contain provisions which will entitle the company to receive percentage rents based on the tenants gross sales 
such percentage rents minimize the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation 
most of the leases at the shopping center properties require the tenants to pay a substantial share of operating expenses  such as real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance costs  and thereby reduce the company s exposure to increased costs 
in addition  many of the leases at the shopping center properties are for terms of less than ten years  which may enable the company to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases
