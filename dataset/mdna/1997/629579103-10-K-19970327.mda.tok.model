the favorable impact from tonnage volume at the project mines was due to increased volume at coteau  falkirk and sabine as a result of increased customer demand 
because actual results exceeded benchmarks established in the long term sales contracts  nacoal received profit incentive payments in the fourth quarter of these payments contributed to the increase in agreed profit per ton 
in addition  the agreed profit per ton increased at coteau due to an annual escalation of profit per ton as provided for in the long term contract

the level of customer fuel requirements produced lower demand at coteau and falkirk and higher demand at sabine  resulting in a slight reduction in overall volume at the project mines in the favorable agreed profit per ton variance at the project mines was the result of the annual escalation in the agreed profit per ton as provided for in the long term contracts with each mine s customer 
increased sales of base tons at red river  which yield a higher price as specified in the supply contract  resulted in a favorable mix variance at the other mining operations

this decline was partially offset by increased volume in europe of percent to  units and in asia pacific of percent to  units 
late and mid acquisitions of european warehouse equipment businesses principally contributed to the unit growth in europe 
product sales mix favorably impacted revenues due to increased sales of higher value product 
intensified pricing pressures in the americas due to decreased industry demand  slightly offset by price increases implemented in europe  caused the unfavorable pricing impact 
the improvement in service parts  concentrated in the americas  resulted from nmhg s increasing lift truck population 
operating profit was positively affected by currency due to the strength of the us dollar against the japanese yen  as costs of japanese sourced goods decreased 
manufacturing costs increased due to lower plant utilization and labor inefficiencies resulting from the decline in market demand 
in addition  provisions to increase warranty and inventory reserves contributed to the increase in manufacturing costs

the price increases announced in mid favorably impacted pricing during all of  while the price increases announced in the spring of reached their full impact in the fourth quarter 
these price increases were enacted to offset the raw material cost increases and currency impacts discussed below 
the unfavorable sales mix resulted from a shift to certain lower margin markets in europe and lower margin products in both the americas and europe 
the strong markets in both the americas and europe  along with price increases in the americas  resulted in improved results from sales of service parts 
the favorable impact from currency on revenues was due to the strength of european currencies relative to the dollar 
this favorable impact was offset by the strength of the yen relative to the dollar  resulting in an unfavorable impact on operating profit  particularly in the first nine months of the strong yen increased the cost of purchases sourced from japan

continued backlog nmhg s backlog of orders at december  was approximately  forklift truck units  compared with  units and  units at december  and  respectively 
this decrease reflects the impact of the decrease in market size  as discussed above 
outlook the forklift truck industry has historically been cyclical  with industry demand fluctuating with the economic conditions in the various geographic markets in which the industry s customers operate 
based on external economic forecasts and recent factory order levels  management expects demand to decline in north america  while other world markets are expected to remain relatively stable 
on a worldwide basis  the company anticipates an overall decline in demand for lift trucks 
consequently  nmhg anticipates a decrease in unit volume in as compared to furthermore  the north american market decline may create pricing pressures and reduced plant utilization which could result in lower profitability 
in  nmhg will continue to strive for increased market share by focusing on certain key markets in europe and asia pacific
