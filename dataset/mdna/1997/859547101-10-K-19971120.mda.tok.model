other matters demand for many of the company s products tends to increase with increases in the rate of inflation as customers strive to improve employee productivity and reduce costs

as widely reported  all users of it systems are contending with the year compliance issue  ie  the issue of whether those systems are capable of processing without error or interruption date related data from more than one century 
the company does not expect to incur significant expense in ensuring that its internal it systems are year compliant  nor does it anticipate any significant difficulties in attaining such compliance 
in addition  most of the products currently offered by the company are year compliant  with the remaining currently offered products expected to become compliant in through new releases 
because year compliance is integrated into its normal product development activities  the company does not expect to incur any significant incremental expense in addressing the year compliance issue in its products 
the company s products operate on and in it systems consisting of third party hardware and software  some of which may not be fully year compliant 
regardless of whether the company s products are year compliant  there can be no assurance that customers will not assert year related claims against the company
