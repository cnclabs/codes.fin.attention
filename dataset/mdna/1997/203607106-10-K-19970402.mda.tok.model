item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to facilitate an understanding and assessment of significant changes in trends related to the financial condition of the company and the results of its operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this prospectus 
all references in the discussion to financial condition and results of operations are to the consolidated position and results of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole 
results of operations net income trend shareholder return trends million reported earnings return on return on average average reported earnings recurring earnings assets equity earnings per share year amount change amount change change net income and profitability net income and earnings per share reached record highs for at million and  respectively 
compared to  net income rose while earnings per share were up  reflecting greater average shares outstanding due to the company s issuance of additional common and preferred stock in mid this issuance put sufficient capital in place to facilitate the purchase of branches from the chase manhattan bank  na on july  recurring or core earnings were up over from last year to million after removing the impact of certain one time income and expense items and net gains losses on the sale of investment securities and other assets 
s net income climbed over the prior year to million while earnings per share were down to  core earnings rose at a pace 
these results reflect the third consecutive year in which acquisitions had an important impact on the company s results 
the contribution of the chase branch purchase to improved profitability in was particularly demonstrated by loan growth in the former chase markets  which enabled the company to increase loans by overall in contrast to a growth rate in its other markets 
on the other hand  part of the benefit of the chase acquisition in was offset by approximately  in one time expenses to integrate the purchase and subsequently sell in mid december of that year the three former chase branches not within cbsi s strategic market area 
in  when three branches from the resolution trust company and one from chase were acquired  nearly  in nonrecurring expenses was incurred to assimilate the purchases 
also in  the company made its first non bank acquisition in many years with the purchase of benefit plans administrators bpa of utica  ny  a pension administration and consulting firm  which contributed nearly  in incremental revenues since its early july acquisition date 
s improvement in net income over the prior year is explained by the following major factors o net interest income full tax equivalent basis climbed  reflecting earning asset growth of million on average or 
growth in loans and investments was approximately equal at million and million  respectively 
eighty six percent of earning asset growth or million was funded with historically stable deposits of individuals  partnerships  and corporations  the balance was funded with borrowings  nearly half of which have original terms in excess of one year 
the company s net interest margin declined a slight two basis points on average to or five basis points to excluding favorable one time items 
o noninterest income excluding net losses on the sale of investment securities and other assets was up owing to continued strength in fiduciary and related services income including the impact of bpa  higher fees from the sale of mutual funds  expanded revenues from merchant credit and check card processing  and greater overdraft fees  service charges  and commissions from an expanded customer base gained from the chase branch purchase 
net gains on the sale of investment securities and other assets were  this year versus a net loss of  in o overhead expense increased by  excluding one time costs of the chase acquisition  growth was million or 
approximately of the latter increase represents personnel costs  largely reflecting the full year versus six month effect of the chase branches and required operations center support as well as selective additions in lending and financial product sales 
a significant balance of the nonpersonnel expense increase was also related to the new branches and the cost of servicing their  customers 
lastly  the full year effect of amortizing the intangible assets associated with the chase transaction accounted for million or over of the adjusted overhead increase 
o loan loss provision expense rose  raising the loan loss reserve to million 
the increase was driven by record loan growth of  the objective to maintain the reserve to outstandings ratio at the level established at the time of the chase transaction  and coverage of higher net charge offs 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding rose to a still historically good  largely due to actions taken in the fourth quarter which reduced nonperforming loans to 
of outstandings  a level less than half the national peer bank norm at september  coverage of reserves to nonperformers is ample in the opinion of management at times 
the above combination of factors resulted in a level of profitability at or above that of cbsi s peer bank holding companies  this group is comprised of companies nationwide having billion to billion in assets based on data through september  as provided by the federal reserve system 
net income per dollar employed  or return on average assets  was up basis points in to  ranking in the peer normal th percentile 
shareholder return on equity  or net income as a percent of average equity  rose basis points to  equaling the th peer percentile 
underlying these modestly improved levels of profitability on an annual basis is a steady increase in quarterly performance measures for the four quarters following third quarter  the first period reflecting the full impact of the chase branch transaction and supporting capital raising 
the initial earnings dilution resulting from those mid events was eliminated by third quarter  when earnings per share reached a record high of 
fourth quarter earnings per share was off 
from that pace to 
due to higher loan loss provision expense resulting from the intensive review of asset quality undertaken during the quarter as mentioned above 
moreover  tangible return on equity  which excludes the impact of writing down deposit acquisition premiums goodwill associated with purchase transactions  rose to for the first nine months of  ranking cbsi in the top quartile of the bank regional peer group whose business strategy  markets  and asset quality closely matches cbsi 
a growing number of bank analysts view this performance indicator as a better measure of a company s core profitability and value created for shareholders 
it recognizes that there is no real economic difference between acquisitions accounted for on a pooling versus a purchase basis  and that since goodwill amortization is not a cash expense  cash earnings under either accounting method are essentially the same 
return on average assets return on average assets  return on average equity  dividend payout and equity to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows at december  percentage of net income to average total assets percentage of net income to average shareholders equity percentage of net income to average shareholders equity plus average preferred stock percentage of dividends declared per common share to net income per common share percentage of average shareholder s equity to average total assets percentage of average shareholder s equity plus average preferred stock to average total assets net interest income net interest income is the company s principal source of core operating income for payment of overhead and possible loan losses 
it is the amount that interest and fees on earning assets loans and investments exceeds the cost of funds  primarily interest paid to the company s depositors as well as interest on borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york 
net interest margin is the difference between the gross yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets

changes due to volume and rate are computed from the respective changes in average balances and rates of the totals  they are not a summation of the changes of the components 
net interest income with non taxable income converted to a full tax equivalent basis totaled million in  this represents an million or increase from the prior year 
the increase was entirely due to higher earning asset volumes  which had a positive impact on net interest income of million  while interest rate changes had a negative impact of only  in contrast  interest rate changes in had a negative impact of million versus higher earning asset volumes having an even more positive impact of million 
combining these components  s net interest income rose million or over the prior year to million 
fourth quarter net interest income was up from the same quarter last year despite a basis point lower margin at 
the reduction in margin reflects continued competitive pressure on loan yields and more importantly  a higher cost of funds reflecting the bank s strategy to expand its funding base through a mix of selected certificate of deposit promotions of maturities over one year and greater borrowings 
with regard to the interest income component of s net interest income  greater average earning assets of million helped contribute million or more in additional gross interest income 
more specifically  higher investment volumes and yields accounted for million of the increase in interest income while growth in loans contributed million 
reflective of the chase branch acquisition in mid  last year s earning asset volumes were up million or over s figures 
nearly half or million in s average earning asset growth resulted from increased lending activity in existing and new markets and the full year impact of loans initially acquired at the chase branches 
the remaining million of growth is explained by an increase in investment outstandings  this reflects both the strategic use of leveraging when favorable buying opportunities existed and the full year impact of investments purchased from funds provided by the chase branch acquisition 
the ratio of loans to earning assets decreased slightly this year as a consequence of the aforementioned investment strategy 
despite a basis point decline in the average prime rate from to  average loan yields declined only basis points from in to this year 
this relative stability reflects cbsi s effective management of a mix of variable and fixed rate product within its loan portfolio 
through september   the company s loan yield was in the favorable th peer bank percentile 
in addition to strong investment growth  the average investment yield improved by basis points from in to in excluding a favorable one time accounting change and discount income earned as a result of a bond being called  the average investment yield would have been or slightly higher than the yield 
through september   the company s investment yield was in the very favorable th peer bank percentile 
the total of average deposits and borrowings grew by million in  partially causing the million increase in total interest expense 
over of this additional expense is due to interest paid on time deposits  whose costs closely track the movement of the treasury yield curve 
during  time deposit rates averaged  or basis points lower than their average 
however  interest expense rose due to a growing mix of time deposits  reflecting movement of funds from savings and money market accounts  promotional rates on and month certificates of deposit  as well as the fact that the acquired chase deposits contained a relatively higher proportion of time accounts 
management was successful in in decreasing the cost of its interest bearing account base not directly priced relative to the treasury yield curve 
the average rate on savings including interest checking and money market accounts decreased by a total of basis points during  falling from in to this year 
largely because of the full impact of the chase deposits  the portion of interest bearing funds which supports earning assets rose slightly in to 
through september   the company s average cost of funds rate improved to the favorable nd peer bank percentile  as compared to being in the st percentile through september  overall  cbsi s net interest margin remained relatively stable in  declining only two basis points  from in to this year 
o the average earning asset yield decreased five basis points to because of the aforementioned decrease in average loan yield and an increased mix of investment securities to earning assets  as marketable securities have historically had lower yields than most types of loans 
this was partially offset by higher investment yields 
o the decline in the average earning asset yield compares to a favorable three basis point decline in the average cost of funds to in this was caused by a significant decrease in the rate paid on savings and money market accounts and a modest decrease in the rate paid on time deposits 
o partially offsetting these rate decreases was an increased mix of time deposits and a basis point increase in the average cost of long term borrowings from in to in  due in part to the company s strategy of borrowing further out on the yield curve in order to minimize longer term risk in a rising rate environment 
average long term borrowings necessary to fund the continued steady loan growth along with cbsi s targeted investment strategy accounted for nearly one third of the total increase in average liabilities 
despite the decline in the company s net interest margin  it ranks in the favorable rd peer bank percentile through september  while the company s net interest margin has historically been well above the norm  the primary objective in recent years has been to maximize shareholder returns through active utilization of tangible capital 
thus  as management focuses on growing the earning asset base of the company  a potential downward change in margin resulting from leverage strategies to take advantage of favorable investment opportunities may be considered secondary to increasing the future stream of net interest income

noninterest income the company s sources of noninterest income are recurring fees from core banking operations including personal trust income and revenues from one time events  defined as net gains losses from the sale of investments  loans  and miscellaneous assets 
beginning in july  recurring fees were importantly augmented by cbsi s acquisition of benefit plans administrators bpa of utica  new york 
this firm provides record keeping and consulting services for sponsors of defined benefit and defined contribution plans as well as offers investment management products for small to medium sized businesses and not for profits through its affiliation with the cbna trust department

core banking fees including bpa represented 
of average assets  a meaningful eight basis points higher than s level in light of an increase in average assets reflective of strong loan and investment growth 
though progress in growing noninterest income has been steady in dollar terms over the last few years  strong asset growth has placed the noninterest income assets ratio in the relatively low th peer percentile 
management s intermediate term objective is to achieve a peer normal ratio of 
based on an analysis of publicly traded commercial banks in the us with assets of million to billion 
noninterest income in fourth quarter climbed over the same period last year 
more than two thirds of the growth reflects the contribution of bpa 
the core banking income assets ratio for the quarter reached

excluding investment security gains losses 
as a percentage of average assets 


in light of management s objective to grow noninterest income  opportunities to develop new fee based products are actively pursued and the collection of fees for providing quality service is emphasized 
these efforts have resulted in new products such as the visa check card initiated in  secondary mortgage market sales servicing beginning in  the offering of mutual funds and annuities launched in  and the aforementioned bpa products 
in early  a cash management product for commercial businesses is expected to be launched 
the focus on growth has also continued to drive efforts to increase fiduciary income  control waived fees  and competitively price deposit service charges and commission based services 
as a result of these efforts  in addition to the benefits provided by the bpa acquisition  fees from core banking operations improved in several key areas in o fees from personal trust services expanded to almost million  up in  primarily reflecting a greater level of estate fees 
continued focus on business development  including an expanded referral program  is expected to strengthen future fiduciary income growth 
o service charges on deposit accounts and overdraft fees increased to million in  a growth rate versus in the increase reflects the full year impact of higher overdraft fees and commissions from an expanded customer base gained from s chase acquisition and the above emphasis on ensuring competitive pricing and reducing waived fees 
o fees earned through the company s visa affiliation rose approximately in to  attributable to continued growth of the new visa check card product which tripled from to and a increase in visa merchant discount fees 
the direct margin on merchant discount fees net of processing expense rose percentage points from in to in o is the third year in which cbsi has offered annuities  mutual funds  and other investment products through financial services representatives fsr s located in seven selected geographic markets within the bank s branch network 
these individuals are registered representatives working through primevest financial services  inc of saint cloud  minnesota 
net commission income from this activity in amounted to  on asset sales of million  more than one and a half times the level of  on sales of million 
this line of special investment products is anticipated to continue to have strong growth in the future 
o general commissions and miscellaneous income at million were up more than in the majority of this year s increase is attributable to the full year impact of fees generated by the chase branches 
nonrecurring other income reflected a gain of  in versus a loss of  in this year s results were largely caused by gains on the sale of student loans and mortgages sold in the secondary market

the primary reason for this year s increase is million more in expenses related to the full year impact of the company s mid purchase of new branches former chase branches net of three sold to nbt bank  na in december plus one former fleet bank facility purchased in olean  new york 
overhead growth also reflects the additions associated with the acquisition of benefit plans administrators in july in brief  approximately  in additional expense was incurred related to bpa  of which  or almost was personnel expense 
without the impact of the new branches and bpa  noninterest expense rose 
as a percent of average assets  this year s overhead at improved from in  moving up to the favorable th peer percentile 
overhead was down in fourth quarter compared to third quarter  entirely explained by the absence of the  one time assessment imposed on the bank on september to build the savings association insurance fund saif 
fourth quarter overhead was lower than the same quarter last year 
for cbsi as a whole  higher personnel expense accounted for over of s increase in overhead  with personnel costs being up versus being higher in salary expense increased by  primarily reflective of staffing the new branches in and new full time equivalents fte s associated with bpa in  along with modest annual merit awards 
total ftes at year end were versus at year end payroll taxes and benefits rose largely due to the additions to staff  offset by a slightly lower benefit cost per employee 
non personnel expense rose million or this year as opposed to a million or a increase in higher occupancy expense  depreciation on equipment  telephone  courier and armored car expense  postage  and computer services resulted from the full year impact of the new locations added in the last half of amortization of intangible assets doubled to million in as a result of the premium paid on the deposits acquired from chase in the previous year 
various other increases related to inflation  internal volume growth  the saif insurance assessment  and a directors stock based retirement plan were partially offset by reduced office supplies  education and seminar costs  sharply lower fdic insurance expense  and the absence of one time items related to the chase branch acquisition 
the efficiency ratio is defined as overhead expense divided by recurring operating income full tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding net securities gains and losses  the lower the ratio  the more efficient a bank is considered to be 
the sharp drop in the ratio from to resulted from the restructuring of the company into a single bank holding company 
s improvement was limited by the additional net overhead of four branches acquired that year 
the slight increase in the ratio to reflects increased costs resulting from the million chase deposit acquisition  as with the much smaller transactions  there had initially been a disproportionately smaller increase in net interest income since practically all of the acquired deposits funded investments rather than higher yielding loans 
in  the efficiency ratio improved by percentage points to  which compares favorably to the national peer bank median of based on data available as of september  the ratio is now better than the level prior to the chase transaction  and excluding the amortization of intangibles  is an even more meaningful lower at based on fourth quarter results 
this progress reflects a combination of strong loan growth  continued focus on strict expense control  and leveraging cbsi s capital through the chase acquisition and subsequent selected capital market borrowing 
management has set an objective to bring this ratio inclusive of intangibles amortization downward to within the next two to four years 
while the company s expense ratios have generally been favorable  management maintains a heightened focus on controlling costs and eliminating inefficiencies 
areas for improvement have been identified through detailed peer comparisons  a bank wide program of employee involvement  and targeted use of outside consultants 
as an example  the transition from microfiche to optical disk for capturing information was completed in  resulting in significant expense savings 
also initiated this year was a program of regional line item expense monitoring by selected managers  this new control mechanism serves as a supplement to regular surveillance by the corporate finance department and has heightened awareness and responsibility for overhead management 
these combined efforts are intended to offset pressure from inflation and higher transaction volumes and enable the company to more fully benefit from economies of scale as it continues to grow

income and income taxes income before tax in was nearly million  up over the prior year s amount 
when pre tax income is recast as if all tax exempt revenues were fully taxable on a federal basis  s results rose by million or the main reasons for improved pre tax earnings were the favorable million increase in net interest income full tax equivalent basis  which reflected the strong earning asset growth discussed previously  and a million climb in noninterest income including the change in net losses on the sale of securities and other assets 
these factors were partially offset by million more in overhead expense  and million more in loan loss provision expense  consistent with cbsi s strong loan growth  so that the ratio of loan loss reserves to loans outstanding was maintained at

this level compares to a year ago 
despite higher capital produced by this year s strong earnings  the increase in the tier i ratio was limited by asset growth resulting  in part  from the strategic use of leveraging via financial market borrowings when favorable investment opportunities existed 
the total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of as of year end was well above the minimum requirement for well capitalized banks 
the company is confident that capital levels are being prudently balanced between regulatory and investor perspectives 
cash dividends declared on common stock in of million represented an increase of over the prior year

to 
dividends declared on cbsi s preferred stock in were  compared to  in the prior year  reflecting a different average level of principle outstanding for the two periods  in december  half of the original million issue was repurchased at no premium to cbsi 
raising the company s expected annualized dividend to per common share represents management s confidence that earnings strength is sustainable and that capital can be maintained at a satisfactory level 
the dividend payout ratio for the year was approximately  or excluding the preferred dividend  and represents an increase from the levels of and  respectively 
the company s targeted payout range for dividends on common stock is

the proceeds from the issuance will be used for general corporate purposes  including the redemption of cbsi s outstanding preferred stock

about of s loan growth took place in the consumer indirect area compared to the share in consumer direct loans accounted for of this year s increase  up sharply from in the prior year  million of the million increase in reflects fixed rate home equity loans formerly categorized as consumer mortgages 
lastly  the share of this year s total loan increase from consumer mortgages remained unchanged at s level of 
the following discusses the underlying reasons for these changes by each of the company s four major lending activities or lines of business

at million  this segment represents of loans outstanding at year end  having expanded its share by three percentage points since year end this relatively high mix compared to the bank s other loan types is largely attributable to borrowing by local commercial businesses 
outstandings climbed over million or in comparative growth rates were for and in this year s growth resulted from strong business development efforts  the aforementioned contribution of the former chase branches accounting for a million increase in commercial loans  and the addition of a number of experienced commercial lenders over the last few years 
almost of the bank s total number of commercial loans have balances less than  which as a group constitutes approximately of commercial loan outstandings 
commercial loans up to  comprise another quarter of loans outstanding while loans in the size range of  amount to 
loans with balances greater than  represent of the portfolio  about percentage points of this segment represents floor plan loans to automobile dealers 
demand for installment debt indirectly originated through automobile  marine  and mobile home dealers continued to be very active in for the third consecutive year 
outstandings ended nearly or million higher compared to growth of or million in the prior year 
strength was evidenced in both cbsi s northern region  where this type of lending has been highly successful for a number of years  and in the southern region  where the commitment to indirect lending was re energized during and has continued with success since then 
this portfolio segment  of which more than relates to automobile lending used vehicles versus new  constitutes over of total loans outstanding  up from its low of at year end the segment of the company s loan portfolio committed to consumer mortgages includes both fixed and adjustable rate residential lending 
it accounts for million or of total loans outstanding 
the modest growth during the last two years million or in  and million or in  reflects a program which began in mid to sell selected fixed rate originations in the secondary market 
the purpose of this program  which resulted in sales of million in its first year  million in and million this year  is to develop a meaningful source of servicing income as well as to provide an additional tool to manage interest rate risk 
the consumer mortgage line of business as of year end is million lower as a result of reclassifying cbna s relatively new and fast growing fixed rate home equity line of credit product to the direct consumer lending activity 
had this reclassification not occurred  the mortgage portfolio growth would have been million or higher than the direct consumer lending activity has increased modestly over the last four years 
outstandings rose or million up or million before the reclassification mentioned above versus or million in this line of business is comprised of conventional installment loans including some isolated installment lending to small businesses  personal loans  student loans which are sold once principle amortization begins  and borrowing under variable and now fixed rate home equity lines of credit 
with the exception of the latter category  growth has occurred only in the installment loan category  with a slight pick up in the last two years due to an apparent movement in consumer preference toward this form of simplified fixed rate borrowing

the company s policy is to place a loan on a non accrual status and recognize income on a cash basis when it is more than ninety days past due  except when in the opinion of management it is well secured and in the process of collection 
provision and reserve for loan losses nonperforming loans  defined as nonaccruing loans plus accruing loans days or more past due  ended at a favorable million 
this level is approximately  higher than one year earlier  primarily due to increased but manageable levels of non accruing commercial and mortgage loans 
accordingly  the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans rose slightly to 
versus 
one year earlier 
as of september   when the nonperforming loan ratio stood at  the company s asset quality was in the favorable st percentile compared to peers 
the ratio of nonperforming assets which additionally include troubled debt restructuring and other real estate to total loans plus oreo is also favorable at

though commercial loan delinquencies have followed a modest down trend over the month period  installment loan delinquencies exhibited a slight up trend  averaging for the last six months of versus for the same prior year period

these measures compare favorably to delinquencies of peer bank holding companies as of september  of   and  respectively 
management strives to maintain its total and component category delinquencies below a internal guideline  and is comfortable that this objective continues to be realistic 
as of september   when overall delinquencies were at  the company ranked in the very favorable lowest peer quartile  consistent with historically being better than the peer norm due to its reliable consumer borrower base 
other factors contributing to successful underwriting  collection  and credit monitoring include selective addition of experienced lenders over the last several years  loan servicing on a regionally focused level  collection departments focused on taking prompt corrective action  and a centralized loan review function which is given priority attention and has monthly board of director accountability 
summary of loan loss experience the following table summarizes loan balances at the end of each period indicated and the daily average amount of loans 
also summarized are changes in the allowance for possible loan losses arising from loans charged off and recoveries on loans previously charged off and additions to the allowance which have been charged to expenses

another measure of the company s strong asset quality is a low net charge offs record  which for the fourth consecutive year was below 
of average loans 
as a result of higher installment loan charge offs  gross charge offs rose to million  or 
of average loans outstanding versus 
in this year s recoveries rose to an all time record in dollar amount to  while down slightly from s record high in percentage terms to of prior year gross charge offs 
as a result  net charge offs at million represented an acceptable 
ratio to average loans 
as of september   the net charge off ratio was slightly better than the peer norm 
a timely charge off policy and relatively low nonperforming loans have enabled the company to carry a reserve for loan losses well below peers 
as a percent of total loans  the loss reserve ratio has remained flat at since mid when the former chase branches were acquired 
though the reserve ratio is presently in the modest th peer percentile  coverage over nonperforming loans as of september  was well above the norm in the rd percentile  management believes the year end level at to be ample 
the company s small business loan orientation has historically reduced the likelihood of large  single borrower charge offs 
another measure of comfort to management is that after conservative allocation by specific customer and loan type  over of loan loss reserves remains available for absorbing general  unforeseen loan losses 
the annual loan loss provision has characteristically been well in excess of net charge offs  which have had coverage of over times since  this year s coverage exceeded almost times 
this practice has enabled a steady increase in the loan loss reserve level  which rose by almost million or to an all time high of million at year end as a percentage of average loans  the annual loan loss provision was above the peer norm in the th percentile as of september  for full year  the loss provision ratio was  having remained in a tight 
to 
range during the prior three year period 
this upward movement reflects the need to cover s higher net charge offs and maintain pace with record loan growth so that the loss reserve ratio is maintained at the targeted level 
the allowance for possible loan losses has been allocated according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within the following categories of loans at the dates indicated at december  percent of percent of percent of percent of percent of loans in loans in loans in loans in loans in each each each each each amount of category to amount of category to amount of category to amount of category to amount of category to allowance total loans allowance total loans allowance total loans allowance total loans allowance total loans dollars in thousands commercial  financial  agricultural      real estate construction real estate mortgage    installment      unallocated n a  n a n a n a  n a total      funding sources typical of most commercial banking institutions today is the need to rely on a variety of funding sources to support its earning asset base as well as to achieve targeted growth objectives 
there are three primary sources of funding that comprise cbsi s overall funding matrix  which considers maturity  stability  and price deposits of individuals  partnerships and corporations ipc deposits  collateralized municipal deposits  and capital market borrowings 
sources of funds average th quarter balances million total funds year ipc deposits public funds capital borrowings sources amount total amount total amount total amount the company s funding matrix continues to benefit from a high level of ipc deposits  which reached an all time fourth quarter high of million  up million or from the comparable period 
ipc deposits are generally considered to be a bank s most attractive source of funding because of their general stability and relatively low cost  and because they represent a working customer base with the potential to be cross sold a variety of loan  deposit and other financial service related products 
strongly impacting the company s ipc funding source was the chase branch deposit acquisition consummated in july following initial deposit attrition of a modest through year end  steady acclimation of this new customer base within the company helped eliminate any further erosion of this funding source during based on year end figures  total chase ipc deposits were virtually the same as one year earlier 
the mix of cbsi s ipc deposits has changed over the last four years 
the steady growth in time deposit share  from of deposits in to this year  reflects consumer movement away from immediately available  lower earning savings and money market accounts 
in addition  the former chase deposits contained a relatively higher proportion of time deposits as suggested by the seven percentage point growth in time deposit share in in  cbsi implemented a strategy to gain new time deposits as well as lengthen existing deposit maturities to improve its interest sensitivity profile by offering an attractive and month certificate of deposit product 
more than million in deposits were obtained  of which in excess of represented new funds to the bank 
deposits of local municipalities remained basically unchanged during the past year  with balances for fourth quarter averaging million versus million for the same quarter in under new york state municipal law  the company is required to collateralize all local government deposits with marketable securities from its investment portfolio 
because of this stipulation  management considers this source of funding to be equivalent to capital market borrowings 
as such  cbsi endeavors to price these deposits at or below alternative capital market borrowing rates 
utilization of municipal deposits has been decreasing over the last three years as a percent of total funding sources 
capital market borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national market basis  generally requiring some form of collateralization 
borrowing sources for the company include the federal home loan bank of new york  as well as access to the national repurchase agreement market through established relationships with primary market security dealers 
capital market borrowings averaged million or of total funding sources for fourth quarter compared to million or 
of total funding sources for the same period in  which followed repayment of previous borrowing levels with the net proceeds from the chase branch purchase 
continued growth in balance sheet assets during was largely responsible for the need to rebuild borrowings to the current level of of total sources

investments and asset liability management the primary objective of cbsi s investment portfolio is to prudently provide a degree of low risk  quality assets to the balance sheet 
this must be accomplished within the constraints of a absorbing funds when loan demand is low and infusing funds when demand is high  b implementing certain interest rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income  c providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct day to day business activities  d considering investment risk weights as determined by regulatory risk based capital guidelines  and e generating a favorable return without undo compromise of other requirements

in order to effectively manage irr  both a short term tactical and longer term strategic horizon are considered 
throughout  the balance sheet of the bank exhibited a structurally asset sensitive profile  in large part due to the continuing influence of the chase branch deposit acquisition consummated early in the third quarter of this profile is illustrated by the year end gap maturity matrix which follows the liquidity section of this analysis 
as a result  investment strategies pursued during the past year were primarily designed to manage this asset sensitive interest rate risk exposure  with a focus on improving the relative performance of net interest income in both rising and falling interest rate environments 
among these strategies was the use of incremental capital market borrowings when favorable investment buying opportunities existed 
examples of investment purchases in include fixed rate u 
s callable agency debentures with to years of initial call protection  as well as longer dated us agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
the result of these investment strategies was a million or increase in cbsi s investment portfolio in to million  this compares to an million or increase in the prior year 
as a consequence of the company s branch acquisition strategy beginning in  which initially has provided a very high level of acquired deposits relative to loans  the ratio of investments to earning assets has steadily increased  ending at or percentage points greater than the prior year end 
the composition of the portfolio throughout the period has heavily favored us governments and us agency mortgage backed obligations  achieving effective use of regulatory risk based capital 
as of year end  these two security types excluding federal home loan bank stock and federal reserve bank stock accounted for of total portfolio investments versus in the prior year 
the average life of the portfolio  including the exercise of embedded call options  decreased to years as of december  as of year end and  the average life of the portfolio stood at years and years  respectively 
callable bond investment strategies pursued during and were largely responsible for this decline in average life 
in addition to strong investment growth  the average investment yield improved by basis points from in to in however  this improvement in part resulted from favorable nonrecurring income  largely in the third quarter  amounting to  this event coincided with the one time assessment imposed on the bank in the same quarter to build the savings association insurance fund saif 
additionally  a  discount was taken into income when a million bond was called early in  this resulted from the generally accepted accounting requirement to accrue a bond discount over the contractual life of the instrument rather than assuming it will be called 
without these two items  the average investment yield would have been or slightly higher than the yield 
the december portfolio yield averaged compared to for the same month one year prior 
through september   reflecting the bulk of the non recurring investment income  the company s investment yield was in the very favorable th peer bank percentile

liquidity due to the potential for unexpected fluctuations in deposits and loans  active management of the company s liquidity is critical 
in order to respond to these circumstances  adequate sources of both on and off balance sheet funding are in place 
cbsi s primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the basic surplus deficit model 
it is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods first  the relationship within days between liquid assets and short term liabilities which are vulnerable to nonreplacement  and second  a projection of subsequent cash flow funding needs over an additional days 
the minimum policy level of liquidity under the basic surplus deficit approach is of total assets for both the and day time horizons
