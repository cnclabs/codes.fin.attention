the revolving credit is due on january   and  if the company is not in default  is automatically renewable for one year renewal terms unless the bank  at its option  delivers written notice of non renewal to the company at least months prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term

the revolving credit bears interest at the bank s floating prime rate  currently per annum 
the term loan and revolving credit facilities are collateralized by the company s working capital and equipment

it is now expected to be paid in full by the end of fiscal  under the revised payment schedule

outlook with the discontinuation of the telecommunications and advanced products divisions  the company is now focused on its information technology and professional services business 
this business has been and is expected to remain profitable with positive operating cash flows 
with the positive free cash flow expected from the services business and with the potential to raise additional equity from the company s equity line agreement  the company expects  over time  to reduce substantially the outstanding principal amount of its bank debt 
risk factors the company and its shareholders face a number of risks  including  but not limited to 
the company s ability to sufficiently grow its services business to generate the needed positive free cash flow to support the debt service described above 

the company s ability to manage within amounts accrued for  and to fund residual net cash expenditures required by  its discontinued operations 

the company s ability to keep and attract the personnel required to service its current and future contract portfolio 

a dependence upon government contracting in general  and particularly a high concentration of the company s business with the us department of defense and its instrumentalities 

the high degree of financial leverage under which the company will continue to operate until its current debt levels are reduced and its equity levels increased 

the risk that the equity line agreement will not remain available  either because the investor does not make required purchases due to any future securities registration problems  or otherwise
