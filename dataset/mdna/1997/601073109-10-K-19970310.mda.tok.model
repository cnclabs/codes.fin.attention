however  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  on january   the company announced the successful completion of its tender offer for all of the outstanding common shares of tylan for per share 
tylan became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company on january  the purchase price was million  plus the assumption of tylan s outstanding debt  net of cash  totaling million 
this acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase in the first quarter of results of operations net sales consolidated net sales  measured in us dollars  increased percent in compared to an increase of percent in the lower sales growth rate in compared to was primarily attributable to the microelectronics manufacturing market entering one of its periodic downturns as well as unfavorable foreign exchange comparisons 
sales growth rates by geography and market  measured in local currencies and us dollars  are summarized in the table below sales growth sales growth rates rates measured in measured in local currencies us dollars americas europe asia pacific consolidated microelectroni cs mfg biopharmaceuti cal mfg analytical laboratory consolidated full year sales in to microelectronics manufacturing customers measured in local currencies increased percent compared to a downturn in the microelectronics market began to impact the company s sales growth around the middle of  as sales to customers in this market grew percent in the first six months of compared to and declined percent in the second half of compared to the slowdown significantly impacted growth in both the americas and japan while sales growth in the remaining asia pacific microelectronics market remained strong 
sales into the microelectronics market comprised percent of total consolidated sales in  versus percent of total sales in sales to the biopharmeceutical manufacturing market grew percent in local currencies during  compared to percent growth in the higher growth rate in was due to increased sales of large protein processing systems to biotechnology customers in both the americas and europe  and higher sales to beer manufacturing customers in japan  particularly in the first six months of the year 
sales to biopharmeceutical customers comprised percent of total sales in and percent in sales to the analytical laboratory market measured in local currencies grew at faster rates in than in and new product introductions and a new distribution strategy in the united states fueled sales growth in this market  particularly in the last six months of sales growth was strongest in the americas and japan  while sales grew more modestly in europe due to a difficult economic environment 
sales to analytical laboratory customers comprised percent of total sales in and percent in foreign exchange rates  primarily the us dollar strengthening against the japanese yen  reduced reported sales growth by percent in  compared to increasing sales by percent in and percent in approximately percent of the company s sales in and were generated in japan 
on average  the us dollar was percent stronger against the japanese yen in compared to the year to year comparisons were particularly unfavorable in the second and third quarters of as the dollar was at historic post war lows against the yen during this time frame in though a weaker dollar will benefit  and a strong dollar will adversely affect future reported sales growth  the company is unable to predict future currency fluctuations and to quantify their effect on net income 
price changes and inflation have not significantly affected the comparability of sales during the past three years 
gross margins gross margins were percent in  percent in  and percent in the margin improvement in was due to continued cost containment and increased volume in the company s manufacturing plants 
the significant volume of business transacted in foreign currencies as discussed above exposes the company to risks associated with currency rate fluctuations which impact the company s sales and net income 
to partially mitigate this risk  the company has entered into foreign currency transactions  forward and option contracts to sell yen  on a continuing basis in amounts and timing consistent with underlying currency exposure on inventory purchases so that the gains or losses on these transactions offset gains or losses on the underlying exposure 
a realized gain of million in and realized losses of million in and million in relating to these contracts were recognized 
these gains and losses were reflected in cost of sales each year  partially offsetting the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations 
at december   the company has open forward exchange contracts to sell yen aggregating million and open forward option contracts to sell yen aggregating million pertaining to this hedging program 
these open contracts have an unrealized gain of million at december  all open contracts mature within months 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses  excluding the effects of foreign exchange  grew percent in  percent in and percent in the company continued to invest in selling and marketing resources to support both new product launches and future sales growth initiatives  particularly in the microelectronics and analytical laboratory markets 
research and development expenses increased by percent in compared to after increasing percent in compared to the increase in spending the past two years is principally due to investments in new products in the microelectronics manufacturing market 
purchased research and development expense of million in represents the write off of in process research and development arising from the acquisition of amicon on december  other income expense gain on sale of equity securities reflects the sale of a significant portion of the company s stock holdings in a japanese company 
the company sold these securities in the third and fourth quarters of to fund a new headquarters and research and development facility in japan 
the cost of moving to this new facility was million and was recorded in s  g a expense 
other expense in reflects a non recurring charge of million to settle litigation which arose from the company s sale of its process water division in net interest expense in was comparable with net interest expense in  as the impact of slightly higher net borrowings during was offset by lower short term interest rates 
net interest expense in was significantly lower compared to and as benefited from the substantial net proceeds received from the divested business the provision for income taxes was percent of pre tax income in  versus an effective rate in and of percent 
while the company continues to benefit from low tax rates in puerto rico and ireland and tax incentives attributable to its us export operations  the overall increase in profitability in slightly diminished the relative benefit derived from these low tax jurisdictions 
the net loss on disposal of discontinued operations reflects the after tax loss of disposing of the company s instrumentation divisions  the sale of which was concluded in earnings per share in the past three years include certain non recurring charges 
earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted for these charges are summarized as follows earnings from continuing operations after charges charges earnings from continuing operations before charges the charge in relates to the write off of purchased in process research and development arising from the acquisition of amicon 
the charge in resulted from the settlement of litigation relating to the company s sale of the process water division in legal proceedings the company and waters corporation are engaged in an arbitration proceeding and related state and federal litigation  which commenced in and  with respect to the amount of assets required to be transferred by the company s retirement plan in connection with the company s divestiture of its former chromatography division 
the company believes that it has meritorious arguments and should prevail 
in the opinion of the company  although final settlement of this matter may impact the company s financial statements in a particular period  it is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
capital resources and liquidity in  the company generated million of cash from operating activities  compared to million in and million in net cash provided by operating activities continued to be the company s primary source of funding capital expenditures  dividends and open market share repurchases in the slight increase in cash generated from operating activities in compared to was primarily due strong collections of accounts receivable  which helped fund an million increase in inventories 
capital spending in was the same as in the company continued to invest in capacity expansions in the company s manufacturing facilities and in information technology systems 
in addition  the company moved into a new headquarters and research and development facility in japan 
as previously discussed  the cost of this move was funded by a sale of equity securities in japan 
the company expects capital expenditures and depreciation expense in to be higher than capital spending and depreciation expense in at december   the company had no significant commitments for capital expenditures 
during the past three years  the company has used cash generated from its operations and  in and  cash generated from the sale of its waters chromatography and bioscience divisions  to purchase shares of its outstanding common stock 
the company spent  net of stock option exercise amounts  million  million and million in   and respectively to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock 
at december   the company had million remaining to spend on a million share repurchase program announced in the first quarter of share repurchases were stopped at the end of the third quarter of to maintain financial flexibility in light of pending acquisitions 
the company does not expect to repurchase additional shares of its outstanding common stock in as cash generated from operations will be used to pay down borrowings required to finance the acquisitions of amicon and tylan 
the net cash outflow of million in for operations discontinued in was in line with the company s expectations 
the company believes that the net cash it will spend in with respect to such divestitures will approximate the accrued divestiture liability of million recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at december  the amount expected to be spent in will be lower than the amount spent in as contractual support services provided to the divested businesses will expire 
the company incurred one time finance related costs in both and  which did not repeat in in  the company paid million to close out the company s german deutsche mark swap 
in  the company paid a total of million in financing related transactions  million was used to pre pay the company s million notes payable due in  while million was used to close out the company s yen currency swap 
the company has million of cash and short term investments on hand at the end of the amount on hand at december  is higher than that normally held by the company and consists primarily of balances held by the company s international subsidiaries which will be used to fund their respective portions of the amicon and tylan acquisitions 
in addition  the company has a million five year credit facility the credit facility in place which was drawn on to fund both acquisitions 
borrowings required to fund the acquisition of amicon were drawn on in december  borrowings drawn on in the first quarter of to fund the acquisition of tylan would have caused the company to violate a covenant with respect to the million percent notes payable due in which required that the company prevent total debt from exceeding of total debt plus equity 
however  the holder of these notes waived the requirement that the company comply with this covenant through march  the company is currently negotiating to change the financial covenant included in this note agreement 
if a revised agreement is not reached by march   the company may redeem the notes using either proceeds from a planned public debt offering for up to million or borrowings potentially available upon request by the company under the credit facility 
the use of debt to finance the acquisitions of amicon and tylan substantially increases the company s debt to equity ratio 
however  the company s financial position remains strong and the company has flexibility in financing future requirements  although such flexibility is more limited than it had been prior to these acquisitions 
dividends the quarterly dividend was increased in the second quarter of from to per share 
dividends paid in were million 
business outlook and uncertainties the following statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
business acquisitions operations related to the acquisitions of both amicon and tylan will be included in the company s statements of income commencing in the first quarter of as both acquisitions are accounted for as purchases  all growth rates in the company s statement of income for will include the impact of adding these two businesses to the company s operations 
in addition  the company expects to record in the first quarter of a non tax deductible charge in the range of million to million for purchased research and development arising from the tylan acquisition 
the successful completion of these acquisitions requires the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently 
the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and there can be no assurance that the potential benefits of such integration will be realized to the extent or on the schedule expected by the company 
moreover  such integration may require a disproportionate amount of the time and attention of the company s management and the company s financial and other resources 
any delays or unexpected costs in connection with such integration could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
sales as previously noted  sales to the microelectronics market in represented percent of consolidated sales 
in and the first six months of  the microelectronics market was the fastest growing market in which the company participated 
however  sales into this market declined percent in the last six months of market research data for the microelectronics manufacturing market is forecasting industry sales growth rate ranging from flat to slightly negative 
sales growth in this market in the past has been volatile  due to general cyclically historically exhibited by this market 
the acquisition of tylan in increases the company s presence in the microelectronics manufacturing market 
as this market has become a more significant component of the company s consolidated sales  the effects of future industry volatility could significantly impact the company s consolidated sales growth 
approximately percent of the company s sales are transacted outside of the americas in currencies other than the us dollar 
late in and early in  the us dollar began to further strengthen against the japanese yen and french franc 
if foreign exchange rates remain at february  levels  the effect of foreign exchange will reduce first quarter and full year reported sales growth by percent and percent  respectively compared to any change in foreign exchange rates will be reflected in the results of operations 
gross margins the company expects gross margin percentages in before the effect of the amicon and tylan acquisitions to be comparable with those in  as improved margins resulting from increased volume in the company s manufacturing plants to support anticipated sales growth is expected to offset slightly lower margins associated with the new us distribution agreement 
lower than expected sales growth will negatively impact the company s ability to maintain or improve gross margin percentages 
other than the us distribution agreement noted above  the company anticipates no significant changes in the pricing of it s products 
historical gross margin percentages generated by amicon approximate those experienced by the company 
however  historical gross margin percentages generated by tylan have been approximately percentage points lower than those experienced by the company 
if anticipated synergies are achieved  the company expects that the acquisition of tylan will reduce consolidated gross margins percentages by to percent compared to operating expenses the company expects to continue investing in operating expenses in a manner consistent with previous years 
the acquisitions at both amicon and tylan will result in incremental operating expenses required to support these additional businesses 
interest expense the company expects net interest expense in will be significantly higher than in due to increased borrowings of approximately million required to complete the acquisitions of amicon and tylan 
the company anticipates that borrowings will fluctuate on a quarterly basis but anticipates no significant increase in borrowings on a full year basis other than the million discussed above 
provision for income taxes excluding the impact of a non deductible in process research and development write off associated with the acquisition of tylan  the effective tax rate in is projected to be in the to percent range  up from percent in as the acquisitions of amicon and tylan will result in additional income being earned outside of the company s low tax rate manufacturing sites 
the tax rate estimate is based on current tax law and is subject to change 
at december   the company had a net deferred tax asset of million 
although realization of the asset is not assured  the company believes it is more likely than not that this net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax considered realizable  however  could be reduced if the near term estimates of future taxable income are reduced  which could result in the company s effective tax rate increasing above the expected to percent range 
capital spending the company expects to spend more for fixed asset additions in than it spent in the company does not believe it needs to significantly expand or add manufacturing capacity in to handle its anticipated sales growth 
the company  however  expects to launch manufacturing operations in china in and will invest in leasehold improvements and machinery and equipment to support this new operation 
the company will also continue to invest in tooling within its manufacturing plants and in information technology as required 
the company also expects that depreciation expense will be higher than depreciation expense
