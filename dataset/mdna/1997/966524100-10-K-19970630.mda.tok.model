the university degree division offers primarily doctorate  master s and bachelor s degrees through colorado tech and its huron university division 
the associate degree division offers associate degrees and diplomas or certificates through sanford brown and uds 
the revenues generated from these subsidiaries primarily consist of tuition and fees paid by students 
the majority of students rely on funds received from title iv programs to pay for a substantial portion of their tuition 
accordingly  a majority of the company s revenues are indirectly derived from title iv programs

the increased enrollment was primarily in the cardiovascular and medical assisting programs offered by uds which were introduced during fiscal the increased revenues derived from increased student enrollment at uds were partially offset by decreased revenues at sanford brown 
this decline in revenues resulted from a decrease in the average monthly earning rate per student that occurred as a result of the lengthening of the curriculum  a decrease in the frequency of class starts and the negative effect of the change in the billing rates for general education courses and core courses 
instruction and educational support increased by million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  instruction and educational support expenses increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal these increases were primarily due to investments made during fiscal for the purpose of enhancing the quality of the education being provided to students  improving student satisfaction  and enhancing the management and staff at the schools in order to strengthen the procedures and controls over regulatory compliance

the company believes that such collection delays have been corrected 
net interest expense decreased  due to a reduction in the average outstanding debt balance and a reduction in interest rates

seasonality the company experiences seasonality in its quarterly results of operations as a result of changes in the level of student enrollment 
new enrollment in the company s schools tends to be higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters because these quarters cover periods traditionally associated with the beginning of school semesters 
costs are generally not significantly affected by the seasonal factors on a quarterly basis 
accordingly  quarterly variations in net revenues will result in fluctuations in income from operations on a quarterly basis

net cash of million was provided by financing activities in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal and a decrease of  from fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a private placement of  shares of the company s common stock to an unaffiliated institutional investor for million 
the decrease in fiscal from was primarily due to the proceeds of million received in fiscal from the long term loan obtained in connection with the sanford brown acquisition 
the company has bank lines of credit of million expiring in may and a revolver note maturing in april in the amount of million 
at march   the company had million outstanding under these facilities 
the amounts borrowed under these facilities in fiscal were primarily used for operations and capital expenditures

the company s primary source of operating liquidity is the cash received from payments of tuition and fees 
most students attending the company s schools receive some form of financial aid under title iv programs 
uds  sanford brown and colorado tech receive approximately  and of their funding  respectively  from the title iv programs 
disbursements under each program are subject to disallowance and repayment by the schools 
in fiscal  the doe conducted a federal program review on sanford brown s title iv activity for the award years through on november   the doe issued its program review reports which cited various deficiencies in the administration of federal student financial aid programs at sanford brown 
the company has disputed some of the doe s findings and is currently working with the doe to resolve all of the remaining issues 
the asset purchase agreement with respect to sanford brown provides for the seller s indemnification of the company for any material liability that may result from the program reviews and the seller has already deposited  with the company in recognition of that obligation 
as a result of the program reviews  the doe placed sanford brown on the reimbursement method of payment for federal pell grant and federal campus based programs 
under the reimbursement method  an institution must demonstrate student eligibility for disbursement of financial aid prior to receiving payment for those students from the doe and may only make requests for payment on a monthly basis 
management believes that although reimbursement for these programs results in some delay in the receipt of funds  sanford brown will continue to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its operating requirements 
as of august   as a result of new doe regulations scheduled for implementation on july   but delayed until august  if an institution is on reimbursement for pell and campus based programs  then it will also be required to obtain prior approval from the doe before it may disburse and or certify a student s eligibility for an ffel 
although management anticipates that in connection with the final resolution of the sanford brown program reviews its ffel participation will not be subject to this new requirement  there can be no assurance that the program reviews will be resolved timely and that the new requirement will not become applicable to sanford brown 
in the event the sanford brown title iv programs remain on reimbursement  and  therefore  sanford brown is required to obtain the approvals for ffel loans described above  this may have a material adverse effect on the cash flow of the company 
in such an event  the company anticipates that it will be able to increase its financings if necessary  however  there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
the company believes that with its working capital  its cash flow from operations  its increased working capital facilities and its increased financings  it will have adequate resources to meet its anticipated operating requirements for the foreseeable future  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case
