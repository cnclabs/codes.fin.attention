the clearance is limited to patients who are receiving fusions using autogenous bone graft only  having the device fixed or attached to the lumbar and sacral spine and having the device removed after the development of a solid fusion mass 
also  the food and drug administration s fda proposed classification  reclassification and codification of pedicle screw spinal systems was published in the federal register in early october the company believes that this proposed rule is reflective of the fda s position on the use of bone screws in the pedicle of the spine and is the result of the fda s analytical review of the fda advisory panel s recommendation  a large historical cohort study and medical literature  as well as data from clinical studies sponsored by several companies

factors that may affect future operating results and financial condition the company s future operating results and financial condition are subject to risks and uncertainties  including without limitation the following matters regulatory clearances 
the company manufactures devices that are subject to the regulations of the fda and  in some cases  to the regulations of foreign governmental authorities 
in particular  such devices are subject to marketing clearance by the fda before sales can be made in the united states 
the process of obtaining marketing clearances can be time consuming  and there can be no assurance that all necessary clearances will be granted to the company with respect to new devices or that the fda review will not involve delays adversely affecting the marketing and sale of new products and devices by the company 
the enforcement of fda regulations depends heavily on administrative interpretation  and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies  with possible retroactive effect  will not adversely affect the company 
the company cannot predict the extent or impact of future foreign  federal  state or local legislation or regulation 
potential impact of health care cost containment proposals on profitability 
in recent years  the cost of health care has risen significantly  and there have been numerous proposals by legislators  regulators and third party health care payers to curb these cost increases in the united states and europe 
some of these proposals have involved limitations on the amount of reimbursement for specific surgical procedures 
these proposals have been adopted in some cases 
the company is unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods utilized by third party health care payers 
in addition  hospitals and other health care providers have become increasingly cost sensitive 
to date  the company does not believe that such health care cost containment proposals have negatively affected the profitability or growth of its business  however  the company is not able to predict the future effect of these proposals on its business 
product obsolescence 
spinal implant and other devices are subject to continuous improvements and modifications and typically are rendered obsolete within a few years 
success  therefore  requires any medical device company to devote substantial resources to continued product development 
the company maintains active research and development programs and has been successful in developing new products in the past 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products that will enable it to remain competitive in the future 
product liability  insurance 
in recent years  physicians  hospitals  and other participants in the health care industry have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging malpractice  product liability or asserting related legal theories  many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs 
the company currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover such claims  although there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all amounts will ultimately be collected from each insurer providing the applicable policy 
such insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
the company is currently involved in product liability litigation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that additional claims will not be asserted against the company in the future 
a successful future claim or aggregation of future claims brought against the company in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows of the company 
claims against the company  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  may also have a material adverse effect upon the reputation and business of the company 
competition 
worldwide  there are a number of firms producing spinal implant devices 
the company currently competes with a number of firms with financial  marketing and technical resources comparable to or greater than those of the company 
because of the growth of the number of spinal fusion procedures performed in recent years  a number of companies  including those active in producing various orthopaedic and neurological products and having financial  marketing and technical resources significantly greater than those of the company  have begun producing spinal implant devices 
the company anticipates that additional companies may also begin such production 
retention of personnel 
the company is highly dependent upon its senior management  and the competition for qualified management personnel is intense 
the loss of key personnel or an inability to attract  retain and motivate such persons could adversely affect the business and prospects of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel if needed 
the company also depends on its contractual relationships with certain physicians for product ideas  research and advice 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain and develop such relationships 
global market risks 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from its international operations 
as a result  the company s operations and financial results could be affected by international factors  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
intellectual property 
the company is dependent on its proprietary intellectual property and attempts to protect such intellectual property through patents  licensing  trade secrets and proprietary know how 
in the medical device industry  challenges by third parties regarding intellectual property rights occur frequently 
such challenges may result in litigation which is often complex and expensive 
there can be no assurance that the company s proprietary rights will not be challenged  rendered unenforceable or circumvented and that pending or future patent or trademark applications will be granted
