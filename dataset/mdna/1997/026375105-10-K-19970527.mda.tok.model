item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations revenues in  strong greeting card performance resulted in a net sales increase of over net sales of everyday cards increased while seasonal cards increased 
the increase in everyday card sales reflects the strength of the everyday card market in the united states and also in australia and new zealand where everyday cards represent nearly of the corporation s net sales in those markets 
in late  the corporation entered into these two markets by acquiring substantially all of the assets of the john sands group  the largest greeting card business in these countries 
in  total net sales of everyday cards increased due primarily to price increases 
the seasonal card sales increase reflected the improvement in the retail environment compared to  particularly in the fourth quarter 
in  net sales of seasonal cards increased less than from due to a weak retail environment 
total unit sales of all greeting cards increased in after remaining flat from to after increasing in  net sales of non card products slowed somewhat in due to softer demand for certain consumer products  particularly non prescription reading glasses and custom display fixtures 
total net sales in increased from the contribution of each major product category as a percent of net sales for the past three years is everyday greeting cards seasonal greeting cards gift wrapping and party goods all other products the all other products classification includes giftware  picture frames  non prescription reading glasses  hair care accessories  educational products  candles  stationery  plush  balloons  stickers  and custom display fixtures 
expenses and profit margins in  strong high margin card sales  along with benefits from the north american plan and a focused effort to control costs resulted in an improvement in pre tax margin 
material  labor and other production costs were of net sales  down from in in these costs were of net sales 
product cost variances related to the conversion of the canadian manufacturing operations to united states manufacturing processes decreased million in as integration of the north american plan progressed 
in  the unfavorable product cost variances from canadian manufacturing contributed significantly to the increase  from  in material  labor and other production costs as a percent of sales 
the cost of greeting card cabinets and point of purchase displays in the united states was well managed in and decreased million from in  the expense of providing these cabinets and displays increased million in the united states from to support new product offerings 
selling  distribution and marketing expenses increased in after increasing in due primarily to an increase in competitive expense and the impact of the john sands group acquisition 
the increase in competitive costs in both years resulted from higher amortization of deferred costs and other expenses related to the corporation s agreements with certain retail customers 
deferred costs and the corporation s method of accounting for them are described in note d to the consolidated financial statements 
selling  distribution and marketing expenses other than competitive costs increased just in after increasing in while total selling  distribution and marketing expenses increased in both and  these costs as a percent of net sales have remained relatively stable at in  in and in administrative and general expenses increased million or after decreasing million or in changes in the expense of the united states profit sharing plan contributed to the variances in both years 
in  profit sharing expense increased million due to higher pre tax income while  in  the asset impairment loss led to lower pre tax income and a million reduction in profit sharing expense 
the increase also includes million more administrative and general expense from the operations of the john sands group 
in  the reduction in profit sharing expense was partially offset by a million loss related to an investment accounted for under the equity method and a million increase in the pre tax cost of corporate owned life insurance 
in the third quarter of  the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in november   the corporation determined that the trends in the creatacard business indicated that the undiscounted future cash flows from that business would be less than the carrying value of the long lived assets related to that business 
as a result  the corporation recognized a pre tax  non cash loss of million for the asset impairment 
after the effect of income taxes  the loss was million or 
cents per share 
see note k to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairment loss 
interest expense increased million in after increasing million in the increase in was due primarily to the long term debt incurred to purchase the john sands group 
the higher interest expense in reflected increased debt levels to support the growth in both inventories and deferred costs 
the effective tax rate was  comparable to in and in while the rate for all three years reflected tax benefits of the corporate owned life insurance  the benefit in was reduced due to the phasing out of the federal income tax deduction for interest on loans associated with these policies 
in  the effective rate was negatively impacted by the write down of nondeductible goodwill which was included in the asset impairment loss 
excluding the impairment loss  the effective rate was 
see note h to the consolidated financial statements for details of the differences between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate 
net income in increased to million or per share compared to net income of million or per share in however  the net income included the impact of the asset impairment loss recognized upon the adoption of sfas no 
and  without this non recurring charge  net income would have been million or per share 
in  net income was million or per share 
liquidity and capital resources in  the corporation s initiatives to manage working capital resulted in a significant improvement in cash flow 
cash flow from operations in increased million to million from million in and million in the significant improvement in was due to higher earnings  slower growth in accounts receivable and a reduction of inventories 
in  higher levels of accounts receivable  inventories and cash payments related to deferred costs resulted in the decrease in cash flow from operations from trade accounts receivable increased million in after increasing million in the receivable balance in both years reflect strong fourth quarter sales of everyday cards and accessories 
as a percent of net sales  accounts receivable were in  in and in inventories as a percent of material  labor and other production costs were in  down notably from in and in the improvement in reflected the corporation s focused efforts to reduce inventory levels 
while the most significant improvements in inventory management were accomplished in the greeting card divisions  where inventories decreased million in after increasing million from to  improvements were realized in almost all business units 
the increase in was due primarily to the growth in non card product inventory  which has a higher cost than greeting cards  to support expanding sales and the acquisition of the john sands group 
payments under agreements with certain retailers net of related amortization increased million in  less than the million increase in payments in both years were made in connection with both new and existing agreements 
although actual payments fluctuate from year to year  the deferred costs which result from the payments are amortized over the effective period of the agreement 
total commitments under the agreements are capitalized as deferred costs when the agreements are consummated  and any future payment commitments are recorded as liabilities at that time 
commitments under existing agreements at the end of were million with million due within the next year 
see note d to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of deferred costs related to certain customer agreements 
effective january   the corporation acquired substantially all of the assets from the john sands group for million in cash 
this acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the purchase price was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based upon their fair market values at the date of acquisition 
results of operations were included prospectively from the acquisition date 
the acquisition was not significant to the corporation s financial position or results of operations as a whole 
capital expenditures were million in  up slightly from million in but down from million in expenditures for the automation of distribution systems and the replacement and upgrade of manufacturing equipment  which began in  continued during the expenditures included the conclusion of the initial roll out of the creatacard personalized greeting card units that began in capital expenditures for are expected to approximate million 
investing activities other than capital expenditures and acquisitions used million less cash in after increasing million in the increase in was due primarily to investments related to expanded product offerings 
these investments decreased substantially in this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the investment in corporate owned life insurance policies 
in  fewer policy loans resulted in a cash investment of million  which exceeded the investment by million 
in  financing activities used million of cash  including million in dividend payments to shareholders 
dividend payments increased million in and million in in  financing activities included a million increase in long term debt used to fund the purchase of assets from the john sands group 
the increase in long term debt also reflected a shift in canadian borrowings from short term to long term 
debt as a percent of total capitalization decreased to in from in after increasing from in the corporation s operating cash flow and existing credit facilities are expected to meet currently anticipated funding requirements 
the seasonal nature of the business results in peak working capital requirements which are financed primarily through short term borrowings 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the corporation s credit facilities 
factors that may affect future results in  the corporation continued its long term record of sales growth and profitability 
a focused effort on working capital management improved cash flow and increased the corporation s financial strength 
however  future revenue trends  profit margins and customer viability are difficult to predict 
the corporation is well represented in a wide variety of channels of distribution  such as mass merchandisers  drug stores and supermarkets 
in  consolidation among retailers  particularly in the drug store business  increased 
although the corporation did not suffer any significant loss of business because of these transactions  the impact of future retailer consolidations on the corporation s business is difficult to assess 
the retail business environment continues to be highly competitive and downturns in the financial strength of retailers may impact the corporation s future results 
the corporation s investment in deferred costs related to agreements with certain retailers continues to increase 
the long term business relationship created by these agreements has been instrumental in the corporation s growth and has insulated it from short term loss of business during retail consolidations 
the corporation continues to evaluate and monitor the financial condition of its retail customers to reduce risk 
the corporation reviews its portfolio of businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure that growth opportunities and return on investments are in line with its long term goals 
while possible acquisitions or divestitures are part of that review process  the consummation of any transaction is unlikely to have a material effect on the corporation s results as a whole
