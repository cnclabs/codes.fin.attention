item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their notes contained in item of this annual report 
our growth in sales and operating income in has been achieved through the successful implementation of our operating strategies 
overall sales growth of from reflects an increase in both the domestic and international sectors 
domestic sales grew by million  bolstered by sales of new products and by domestic acquisitions 
acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the domestic sales growth 
international sales grew by million 
acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the international sales growth  while unfavorable foreign currency effects decreased international sales by approximately million 
as discussed in item  business general  we have maintained an active program of developing and marketing both new products and product line extensions 
we believe that new product introductions are important to the ability of our operating subsidiaries to maintain their competitive positions 
we have also pursued numerous acquisition opportunities  completing more than acquisitions since  of which we completed in acquisitions completed in were as follows approximate acquisition company annual sales date description pure fit  inc million manufacturer of stainless steel fittings used in the fabrication and assembly of sanitary and food grade hose 
d w  inc million manufacturer of cut glass 
trend scientific  inc million manufacturer of diagnostic testing systems for microbiology laboratories 
precision rotary instruments million manufacturer of carbide and diamond dental burs 
harvey r bench top sterilizer business line of getinge castle  inc million manufacturer of bench top sterilizers 
alexon biomedical  inc million manufacturer of diagnostic test kits for intestinal infections 
remel limited partnership million manufacturer and distributor of an extensive line of microbiology and diagnostic products 
nippon intermed kk million acquired of the outstanding stock of a japanese distributor of nni products 
national scientific company million manufacturer of supplies for the laboratory industry primarily used in chromatography analysis 
drug screening systems  inc million manufacturer of on site drug screening products 
carr scarborough microbiologicals  inc million manufacturer of medical diagnostic products used to detect bacteria and fungi involved in infections 
integrated separation systems million manufacturer of electrophoresis gels  reagents  equipment and related accessories 
includes pro forma estimate for chrisope technologies lc  acquired by remel limited partnership in november these acquisitions are consistent with our strategy of acquiring product lines that can be manufactured in existing facilities  sold through existing sales and distribution networks  or both 
we intend to continue to seek out acquisition candidates consistent with our strategy 
however  there can be no assurance of the number or size of future acquisitions 
as described in item  legal proceedings  one of our subsidiaries is involved as a prp at the aqua tech site  and another is involved in legal proceedings relating to environmental claims against it with respect to the rochester site 
because the testing has not been done to determine what remedy  if any  should be required at the aqua tech site and will not be completed prior to the end of  an estimate of our potential liability with respect to this site cannot be made at this time 
however  and although cercla does provide for joint and several liability  because our share of waste allegedly sent to the site is reportedly not more than of the total waste sent  we believe that any ultimate liability with respect to the aqua tech site will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
as previously reported  on may   combustion engineering  inc ce commenced legal proceedings in the new york supreme court  county of monroe the ce litigation  against the company with respect to the former taylor instruments taylor facility in rochester  new york the rochester site or site  a discontinued operation 
according to ce s complaint  its claims are based on an asset purchase and sale agreement dated as of september   pursuant to which taylor was sold to ce the agreement  and an agreement between a subsidiary of the company and ce dated august  the agreement 
the complaint alleges that under the agreement the company retained certain liabilities for  and indemnified ce with respect to  environmental contamination  hazards and other conditions that existed at the time of the sale of taylor to ce  and that under the agreement  the company agreed to bear percent of the costs thereafter incurred to clean up  remediate and remove mercury from the land and buildings at the rochester site 
ce s complaint seeks declaratory relief and claims damages of at least million with respect to expenses ce has incurred and expects to incur to remediate and remove mercury contamination from the land and buildings sold to ce at the rochester site 
the complaint also seeks declaratory relief and claims damages in excess of million with respect to expenses incurred and expected to be incurred for remediating other alleged environmental hazards associated with the rochester site 
some of ce s claims relate to the cost to demolish and dispose of the buildings at the rochester site  which ce maintains it had to do because the buildings were contaminated with mercury 
ce previously informed the company that ce claims that the company s share of such demolition and disposal costs is approximately million 
the company denies it has any liability for such costs 
ce s remaining claims relate to alleged soil and groundwater contamination  including mercury contamination  for which the company also denies liability 
the ce litigation has not yet advanced beyond the filing of the complaint 
prior to commencement of the ce litigation  ce conducted testing at the site to determine the nature  extent and location of any onsite contamination 
it has continued to conduct onsite and offsite testing following commencement of the ce litigation 
in addition  ce negotiated and entered into a voluntary clean up agreement vca concerning the site with the new york state department of environmental conservation the nysdec 
under the terms of the vca  ce and nysdec are to negotiate onsite and offsite cleanup goals 
ce and nysdec are currently negotiating cleanup goals for onsite soil contamination 
as part of the negotiations  ce submitted to nysdec a series of technical memoranda which summarize the results of investigations conducted by ce into the onsite contamination 
ce also submitted to nysdec a draft technical memorandum which proposes onsite cleanup goals for soil contaminated by mercury  trichloroethylene tce and total volatile organic compounds tvocs 
ce s submission estimated that the remediation of mercury contaminated soils would cost approximately million based on a proposed plan to excavate and remove mercury contaminated soils exceeding ce s proposed cleanup goal  and that the remediation of tce and tvoc contaminated soils would cost between  and million  depending upon the remedial method for tce and tvoc contaminated soils ultimately agreed upon by ce and nysdec 
once the cleanup goals for onsite soil contamination are established  ce and nysdec plan to address both onsite and offsite ground water contamination in conjunction with the negotiations concerning offsite cleanup goals 
ce and nysdec agreed in the vca to reach agreement on offsite cleanup goals by january  to assist in those negotiations  ce is presently contemplating whether to perform an additional investigation of groundwater to further define the nature and extent of any offsite groundwater contamination emanating from the site 
the company believes the cost estimates developed by ce for the onsite soil remediation are not reliable or meaningful cost estimates as they are based on insufficient data and information 
in addition  because ce and nysdec have not yet reached agreement on either onsite or offsite cleanup goals  or on the remedial method for achieving the yet to be agreed upon onsite and offsite cleanup goals  and because the extent of the company s liability  if any  to ce is uncertain  the company cannot estimate the potential cost to it of ce s claims 
the company has provided notice of ce s claims to its third party liability insurance carriers 
to date  the carriers have denied coverage 
for additional information regarding factors that may influence our performance  see item  business and item  legal proceedings 
our results of operations reflect goodwill amortization  other amortization  and depreciation  which are non cash charges  totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization increased in due to our acquisition activity and associated amortization of stepped up assets and goodwill 
in fiscal  depreciation of stepped up assets associated with the leveraged buyout in of a company known at the time as sybron corporation the acquisition will decrease by approximately million  primarily as a result of the completed write off of depreciation associated with machinery and equipment with a ten year life 
this decrease is expected to be entirely offset by past and continuing acquisition activity 
as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
ebitda represents  for any relevant period  net income except that extraordinary items are excluded plus i interest expense  ii provision for income taxes  iii depreciation  and iv amortization  all determined on a consolidated basis and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
substantial portions of our net sales  net income and cash flows from operations are derived internationally 
the financial position and the results of operations from substantially all our international operations  other than most us export sales  are measured using the local currency of the countries in which such operations are conducted and are translated into us dollars 
while the reported income of foreign subsidiaries will be impacted by a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar in relation to a particular local currency  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partially mitigated by the fact that manufacturing costs and other expenses of foreign subsidiaries are generally incurred in the same currencies in which sales are generated 
effects of foreign currency fluctuations are also mitigated by the fact that our subsidiaries operations are conducted in numerous foreign countries and  therefore  in numerous foreign currencies 
in addition  our us export sales may be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations due to the relative value of the us dollar as foreign customers may adjust their level of purchases upward or downward according to the weakness or strength of the us dollar 
in order to hedge against future strengthening of the us dollar  from time to time in the past and most recently in october we employed currency hedges through the purchase of a series of options 
in october we purchased options with a us dollar notional amount of approximately million at a cost of approximately million 
these options will expire in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal and are designed to protect us from potential detrimental effects of currency movements associated with the united states dollar versus the german mark and the french franc as compared to the third and fourth quarters 
from time to time  we may employ additional currency hedges to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
based on a preliminary study  we expect to incur total expenses of approximately million to modify certain computer information systems in order to enable proper processing of transactions relating to the year and beyond 
we expect most of these expenses to be incurred in fiscal we continue to evaluate other appropriate courses of corrective action  including the replacement of certain systems at an estimated cost of million which would be capitalized and amortized over the systems useful lives 
we do not expect the amounts to be expensed over the next two years to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in  approximately million was expensed on year issues

in  and  respectively 
diluted eps is expected to remain the same as previously reported primary and fully diluted eps in  and in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas 
as a result of sfas  we will be required to separately report comprehensive income components previously excluded from our net income 
comprehensive income includes all changes to our equity during a period except those resulting from investments by or distributions to shareholders 
because comprehensive income is subject to external factors beyond our control  including but not limited to foreign currency fluctuations and economic factors  we cannot at this time estimate impacts from sfas in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  which is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  sfas establishes standards for the way we are to report information about operating segments in annual financial reports issued to shareholders

depreciation and amortization expense was allocated among cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and other expense 
depreciation and amortization increased in due to additional depreciation and amortization from the step up of assets and goodwill recorded from the acquisition of nunc  as well as from additions from other acquisitions and capital expenditures 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on net sales or income during any of the periods presented above 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
liquidity and capital resources as a result of the acquisition and the acquisitions completed since  we increased the carrying value of certain tangible and intangible assets consistent with generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  our results of operations include a significant level of non cash expenses related to the depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of intangible assets  including goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets increased by approximately million in  primarily as a result of acquisition activity 
we believe  therefore  that ebitda represents the more appropriate measure of our ability to internally fund our capital requirements 
our capital requirements arise principally from indebtedness incurred in connection with the permanent financing for the acquisition and our subsequent refinancings  our working capital needs  primarily related to inventory and accounts receivable  our capital expenditures  primarily related to purchases of machinery and molds  the purchase of various businesses and product lines in execution of our acquisition strategy and the periodic expansion of physical facilities 
in addition  in the event we should be held liable for ce s claims in the ce litigation described above  liability for which we deny  we could require capital to satisfy such liabilities  depending upon their magnitude 
it is currently our intent to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy 
if acquisitions continue at our historical pace  of which there can be no assurance  we may require financing beyond the capacity of our credit facilities as defined below 
in addition  certain acquisitions previously completed contain earnout provisions requiring further payments in the future if certain financial results are achieved by the acquired companies 
see also note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
the statement contained in the immediately preceding paragraph concerning our intent to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy is a forward looking statement 
our ability to continue our acquisition strategy is subject to a number of uncertainties  including  but not limited to  our ability to raise capital beyond the capacity of our credit facilities and the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices 
see cautionary factors below 
on july   we entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement with chemical bank now known as the chase manhattan bank chase and certain other lenders providing for a term loan facility of million the term loan facility  and a revolving credit facility of million the revolving credit facility collectively the credit facilities 
on the same day  we borrowed million under the term loan facility and approximately million under the revolving credit facility 
approximately million of the borrowed funds were used to finance the acquisition of the nunc group of companies approximately million of the acquisition price for nunc was borrowed under our previous credit facilities 
the remaining borrowed funds of approximately million were used to repay outstanding amounts  including accrued interest  under our previous credit facilities and to pay certain fees in connection with such refinancing 
on july   under the first amendment to the credit agreement the first amendment  the capacity of the revolving credit facility was increased to million  and a competitive bid process was established as an additional option for us in setting interest rates 
on april   we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement the second amendment 
the second amendment is an expansion of the credit facilities 
the term loan facility was restored to million by increasing it by million equal to the amount previously repaid through april  and the revolving credit facility was expanded from million to million 
on april   we borrowed a total of million under the credit facilities 
the proceeds were used to repay million of previously existing libor as defined below and abr loans as defined below including accrued interest and certain fees and expenses under the credit facilities and to pay million with respect to the purchase of remel which includes both the purchase price and payment of assumed debt 
the million of caf as defined below borrowings remained in place 
payment of principal and interest with respect to the credit facilities and the sale leaseback as defined later herein are anticipated to be our largest use of operating funds in the future 
the credit facilities provide for an annual interest rate  at our option  equal to a the higher of i the rate from time to time publicly announced by chase in new york city as its prime rate  ii the federal funds rate plus of  and iii the base cd rate plus  collectively referred to as abr or b the london interbank offered rate libor plus to the libor margin depending upon the ratio of our total debt to ebitda  or c with respect to the revolving credit facility  the rate set by the competitive bid process among the parties to the revolving credit facility established in the first amendment caf 
in  the average interest rate on the term loan facility inclusive of the swap agreements described below was and the average interest rate on the revolving credit facility was 
as a result of the terms of the credit agreement and our agreement governing the previous credit facilities  we are sensitive to a rise in interest rates 
in order to reduce our sensitivity to interest rate increases  prior to september   we entered into eight interest rate swap agreements  aggregating a notional amount of million  to hedge against a rise in interest rates 
the net interest rate paid by us is approximately equal to the sum of the swap agreement rate plus the applicable libor margin 
during  the libor margin was 
the swap agreement rates and durations are as follows expiration date notional amount swap agreement date swap agreement rate december  million december  july  million july  august  million august  august  million august  august  million august  september  million december  may  million may  september  million december  also as part of the permanent financing for the acquisition  on december   we entered into the sale and leaseback of our principal domestic facilities the sale leaseback 
in january  the annual obligation under the sale leaseback increased from million to million  payable monthly 
on the fifth anniversary of the leases and every five years thereafter including renewal terms  the rent will be increased by the percentage equal to of the percentage increase in the consumer price index over the preceding five years 
the percentage increase to the rent in any five year period is capped at 
the next adjustment will not occur until january  we intend to fund our acquisitions  working capital requirements  capital expenditure requirements  principal and interest payments  obligations under the sale leaseback  restructuring expenditures  other liabilities and periodic expansion of facilities  to the extent available  with funds provided by operations and short term borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
to the extent that funds are not available  particularly with respect to our acquisition strategy  we will have to raise additional capital 
as set forth above  after the second amendment  the revolving credit facility provides up to million in available credit 
at september   there was million of available credit under the revolving credit facility 
under the term loan facility  on july  we began to repay principal in consecutive quarterly installments by paying the million due in annual payments  commencing in fiscal  are due as follows million  million  million  million and million 
the credit agreement contains numerous financial and operating covenants  including  among other things  restrictions on investments  requirements that we maintain certain financial ratios  restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness or to create or permit liens or to pay cash dividends in excess of million plus of our consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter ending after june   less any dividends paid after june   and limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness 
the credit agreement permits us to make acquisitions provided we continue to satisfy all financial covenants upon any such acquisition 
our ability to meet our debt service requirements and to comply with such covenants is dependent upon our future performance  which is subject to financial  economic  competitive and other factors affecting us  many of which are beyond our control
