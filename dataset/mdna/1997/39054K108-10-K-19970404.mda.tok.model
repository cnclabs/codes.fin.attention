the increase in passenger yield is due primarily to the expiration of the transportation tax without a corresponding reduction in ticket prices and increases in certain fares 
midway connection s full year operation increased the overall average as a result of its higher yield produced from its passengers with shorter trips 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased to million  or cents per asm  in from million  or cents per asm in in part  the increase in cost per asm is due to decreased utilization of the embraer aircraft because of two airworthiness directives requiring frequent propeller inspections and lack of replacement propeller blades during the first quarter of the increase of total operating expenses reflect the costs associated with expansion of the company s aircraft fleet and increased level of operations  except as detailed below

the change in mix of aircraft expense towards increased aircraft rental expense from depreciation and interest expense is due to a policy decision to lease the majority of aircraft acquisitions in order to gain advantage of lower capital costs 
further  concurrent with acquisitions of new beech aircraft  older aircraft were being returned to raytheon and reacquired under reduced leases offering more flexible terms for early termination

other operating expenses increased to cents per asm in from cents in  reflecting higher passenger booking fees due to increases in rates and increased bookings for the midway connection and higher credit card expenses for the midway connection and great lakes airlines operations 
these expenses were also increased due to flight cancellations resulting from severe weather conditions in upper midwest and to unanticipated turnover in flight personnel due to major carrier hiring 
during the fourth quarter of  the company accelerated its program to replace its beechcraft c aircraft with d aircraft 
as a consequence  the company believes it has excess beechcraft c inventory and has made an adjustment for million dollars to reduce the inventory to estimated net realizable value 
these increases were partially offset by lower united program fees due to increased flying under the company s own code and insurance proceeds from the november accident

the decline in load factor is due primarily to increased competition in existing markets at a time when the company was adding capacity to expand service to new and existing routes for the united express systems  mainly in the first two quarters of see business competition 
in addition  the reduction in load factor is due to the introduction of midway connection flying where the company experienced a load factor from october through december the average load factor in the first quarter of for midway connection was

provision benefit for income taxes the company s effective rate was percent in and percent in liquidity and capital resources the major uses of working capital in were the net loss of million and increase of inventory of million offset by non cash charges for depreciation of million and the increase of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  the latter primarily from extending the period of time before invoices were paid 
inventory increased by million due to increased levels of embraer and beechcraft d parts 
the increase in inventory was offset by an increase of million in a valuation allowance to reduce the inventory to net realizable value 
further mitigating the above uses of cash flows in operating activities was the reduction in accounts receivable resulting from the advance collection of million owed by united

the company has received formal notice of default concerning non payment of obligations owed under two of the brasilia agreements under which the company leases a total of brasilia aircraft 
the company has been in negotiations with its lessors and lenders for deferral or other credit accommodations under the aforementioned lease and debt agreements  and in conjunction with such negotiations is seeking amendments of the agreements or waivers of the related defaults

seasonality since commencing operations  the company has traditionally experienced lower passenger load factors during the months of november through april 
this seasonality can be attributed primarily to relatively difficult winter weather operating conditions in the company s principal area of operations and fewer vacation and other discretionary trips and reduced business travel during these months 
these seasonal factors have generally resulted in reduced revenues  profitability and cash flow for the company during these months 
frequent flyer program on the company s united express and midway connection flights passengers may earn miles in united s mileage plus and american airlines aadvantage frequent flyer programs  and passengers may use mileage accumulated in these programs to obtain discounted or free tickets for trips that might include a flight segment on one of the company s flights 
no revenues are earned or collected on free tickets awarded to passengers under the programs 
awards earned under the frequent flyers programs have an expiration date three years from the date earned 
the programs also contain certain restrictions  including blackout dates and capacity controlled bookings which substantially limit the use of awards on certain flights and during the busiest periods 
the company continually monitors the number of free travel award reservations on its flight segments to ensure that they are within the capacity restrictions defined in the mileage plus and aadvantage programs 
the company s yield management program and related seat restrictions minimize the number of revenue passengers that may be displaced on any individual flight segment 
to date  the company has not experienced any material use of mileage plus and aadvantage awards to obtain travel on flights  and the incremental cost to the company attributable to the exercise of frequent flyer awards consisting primarily of a minimal amount of additional gate and passenger service expenses has not been material 
awards used on the company s flights during the year ended december  represented approximately percent of the company s total passengers 
the company expects that this percentage will remain approximately the same for the foreseeable future 
based on this low percentage  on the availability on many of the company s flights of otherwise vacant seats  and on the programs restrictions  the company believes that the displacement  if any  of revenue passengers by users of mileage plus and aadvantage awards will not become material 
the company continually monitors the number of awards redeemed and will accrue the incremental costs associated with the mileage plus and aadvantage programs if they become material 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations in the past five years 
cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of cautionary factors the company wishes to caution stockholders and prospective investors that the following important factors  among other identified in this annual report on form k  could affect the company s actual operating results  and that such results could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by the company 
the statements under this caption are intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the following information is not intended to limit in any way the characterization of other statements or information under other captions as cautionary statements for such purpose 
the order in which such factors appear below should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority 
additional financing requirements the company s ability to maintain operations at current levels is materially dependent on its ability to obtain substantial additional financing 
in the most recent two years  the company has experienced significant operating losses as a result of increased competition in the marketplace  operational and equipment reliability challenges  and expenses relating to expansion of fleet types 
the difficult environment in which the company competes will continue into the foreseeable future 
while the company is making efforts to achieve profitability  primarily through revised scheduling  including reallocation of brasilia assets from the midway system to the united express system  continuing losses have resulted in significant liquidity pressures 
the company has significant financial obligations  including interest bearing debt and capital lease obligations 
the company s long term debt and lease obligations require significant periodic cash payments and the company has not made these payments on a timely basis 
the company has not obtained commitments for additional capital and will be required to rely on increases in financial performance to supply funds necessary for debt service and working capital requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company s financial performance will improve sufficiently to provide cash needed for operations 
dependence on relationship with united the company generated approximately of its revenues for the year ended december  under the united express agreements described under business the company s regional identities 
the united express agreements require the company to comply with specific operating performance standards and  with certain limited exceptions  restrict the ability of the company to merge with another company or dispose of its assets or aircraft without first offering united a right of first refusal to acquire the company or such assets or aircraft 
the united express agreements also prohibit the company from entering into similar arrangements with other carriers in chicago  denver  minneapolis st 
paul  detroit  des moines or omaha without united s prior approval 
the united express agreements require the company to obtain united s prior consent to operate as a united express carrier in any market  except for certain pre approved markets connecting with minneapolis st 
paul or detroit 
the united express agreements terminate in april and are subject to termination upon the failure of the company to provide specified levels of service or performance or upon other specified events 
a failure to renew the united express agreements  any termination or materially adverse modification of the agreements  or any substantial decrease in the number of routes served by the company under the agreements would have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
as a result of the united express agreements  the company s business is sensitive to events and risks affecting united 
if adverse events affect united s business  the company s business will also be adversely affected 
united option to purchase o hare slots united holds an option to purchase or lease all or a portion of the landing and takeoff slots which the company holds at the chicago o hare airport 
united may acquire these slots for the lesser of their fair market value or million 
united s acquisition of the slots is subject to the approval of dot and the assumption by united of essential air service responsibility to certain communities 
in the event united acquires these slots  the company has the right to lease the slots from united for a period of only one year thereafter 
in the event united exercises this option and declines to extend the term of the lease back to the company  the company s operations at the chicago o hare airport would be adversely affected 
effect of general economic conditions the airline industry is significantly affected by general economic conditions 
during recent recessions  most airlines reduced fares in an effort to increase traffic 
economic and competitive conditions in the airline industry have contributed to a number of bankruptcies and liquidations among airlines 
a worsening of current economic conditions  or an extended period of recession nationally or regionally  would have a materially adverse effect on the company s operations 
fuel costs fuel is a major component of operating expense for all airlines 
the company s cost of fuel varies directly with market conditions  and the company has no guaranteed long term sources of supply 
the company intends generally to follow industry trends by raising fares in response to significant fuel price increases 
however  the company s ability to pass on increased fuel costs through fare increases may be limited by economic and competitive conditions 
accordingly  a reduction in the availability or an increase in the price of fuel could have a materially adverse effect on the company s cash flow from operations and profitability 
seasonality historically  the company has experienced lower passenger load factors during the months of november through april 
this seasonality can be attributed primarily to relatively difficult winter weather operating conditions in the company s principal area of operations  resulting in fewer vacation and other discretionary trips and reduced business travel during these months 
these seasonal factors have generally resulted in reduced revenues  increased operating losses and reduced cash flow for the company during these months
