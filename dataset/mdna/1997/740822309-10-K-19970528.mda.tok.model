item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion  which covers the fiscal years through  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the separate financial statements of the connelly group  lp and prc holdings corporation and the notes thereto included elsewhere in the report 
overview the company s operating results are affected by a number of factors  including competitive pressures  changes in regulations governing the company s activities  the seasonal nature of its business  the timing of the commencement of its proposed gaming operations  the amount of pre opening expenses incurred by the company and general weather conditions 
consequently  the company s operating results may fluctuate from period to period and the results for any period may not be indicative of results for future periods 
competition has had a significant impact on the results of operations at each of the company s three casino properties 
since gaming began in biloxi in august  steadily increasing competition along the mississippi gulf coast  including new orleans and elsewhere in louisiana and mississippi  has had an adverse effect on the results of operations in biloxi 
several large hotel casino complexes have been built in recent years and several new large projects are under construction 
the replacement of the smaller m v president casino mississippi by the biloxi barge  in july  improved the company s presence in biloxi 
however  it is apparent that it will continue to be more difficult to compete as larger casino complexes enter the biloxi market  many being built by competitors having substantially greater name recognition and financial and marketing resources than the company 
in may  legislation became effective in iowa which enabled the davenport operation to compete more effectively against illinois riverboat casinos 
this legislation removed all per passenger loss and bet limitations and essentially allowed for dockside gaming throughout the year  except for a required cruises per year 
the davenport operating results improved substantially after the implementation of this legislation 
however  in april a new casino commenced operations in bettendorf  iowa  which is located on the mississippi river five miles from the davenport operations 
the new casino captured a portion of the market and  as a result  the davenport operations were negatively impacted 
davenport s operating revenues were also negatively impacted from the period november  through april  while the president was removed from service for a us coast guard mandated five year hull inspection and a smaller vessel was substituted 
in may   the company commenced limited gaming operations in st 
louis  missouri aboard the admiral 
at such time  missouri law did not permit the operation of games of chance  including slot machines 
in december  after the missouri state constitution was amended  the company was permitted to add games of chance to its casino 
competition is intense in the st 
louis market area 
there are presently five other casino companies operating in the market area and competing for local customers 
two of these are illinois casino companies operating single casino vessels on the mississippi river  one directly across the mississippi from the the admiral and the second miles upriver in alton  illinois 
there are three missouri casino companies  each of which operates two casino vessels approximately miles west of st 
louis on the missouri river  one in the city of st 
charles  missouri and two in maryland heights  missouri 
the two in maryland heights opened in march riverboats in each of the states  illinois and missouri  have competitive advantages disadvantages resulting from gaming regulations in their respective states 
while missouri regulations do not require the vessels to actually cruise  simulated cruising requirements are imposed which allow entry on a vessel for only a minute period every two hours 
those competitors having two casino vessels can alternate hourly boarding times and provide virtually continuous boarding for guests 
thus  they have a distinct competitive advantage over the company  which has only one vessel  the admiral 
illinois casino vessels are required to cruise  thereby limiting ingress and egress to the casinos 
in addition  missouri regulations limit the loss per cruise per passenger by limiting the amount of chips or tokens a guest may purchase to per two hour gaming session 
the lack of a statutory loss limit on illinois casinos allows them to attract higher stake gamblers  additionally  their guests are not burdened with the administrative requirements related to the loss limits 
any change in the legislation related to these requirements could have a positive or negative impact on the competitive environment between missouri and illinois casinos 
in previous years  the company pursued various unsuccessful development opportunities  the results of which negatively impacted operations  including the impact these investment decisions had on the ultimate recoverability of various assets 
specifically  the company began operations in tunica  mississippi in december and as a result of competition  poor location and various other factors  closed this facility in july the company incurred net losses of million related to tunica in fiscal year in october the company entered into a joint venture with an unrelated third party to manage a land based gaming casino to be owned by the st 
regis mohawk indian tribe the tribe 
in fiscal year  due to uncertainty related to various matters  including the execution of a management agreement with the tribe  the company wrote off its million investment in this project 
in december the company entered into a joint venture to develop a riverboat casino operation in gary  indiana 
as a result of a number of events and as part of the company s strategy to concentrate its resources and capital on its existing operations  the company reexamined its participation in this joint venture  and on june   transferred its entire interest in the venture to its partner 
the company wrote off million in fiscal as a result of the decision to withdraw from the gary  indiana development 
in december  the company entered into a lease purchase option agreement covering an acre riverfront site and a city owned pier located immediately contiguous to this property in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
this option agreement expired december  in fiscal year  the company wrote off its million investment in this option due to the uncertainty as to the timely passage of pennsylvania riverboat gaming legislation prior to the expiration of the option 
in december  the company modified and exercised a new option agreement to secure the above pennsylvania lease rights for the period january  through december  pursuant to the modified option agreement  the company remitted million 
the modified agreement also calls for contingent payments  not to exceed million  based on the status of certain pennsylvania gaming legislation during calendar year during the option period and the lease period  the company will be obligated to pay all maintenance costs  taxes and insurance with respect to the property 
the company s operations are seasonal in nature  with the heaviest activity occurring during the period from may through september 
in addition  all of the company s operations are susceptible to the adverse effects of flooding and weather conditions 
on various occasions the company has temporarily suspended operations in davenport and st 
louis as a result of flooding and the biloxi operation has been temporarily closed on occasion as a result of hurricanes 
results of operations the results of operations for fiscal years through include the gaming results for davenport  iowa and biloxi  mississippi for the entire period and st 
louis  missouri for only a portion of that period 
st 
louis commenced limited gaming operations in may  which operations were expanded to include games of chance in december gaming operations were also conducted in tunica  mississippi from december through july of much lesser significance  the non gaming operations for davenport the blackhawk hotel and st 
louis gateway riverboat cruises are included during all three years 
the following table highlights the results of operations for the company s gaming and non gaming cruise operating subsidiaries

income taxes statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the recognition of deferred tax assets related to certain temporary differences between the company s tax and accounting records and net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not 
in fiscal year  management believed that the company would return to profitability and that it was more likely than not that the company would be able to generate sufficient taxable income to recognize fully these assets over the carryforward period 
this belief was based upon the company s history of prior earnings  the fact that the losses suffered by the company were attributable  in large part  to certain unprofitable operations which were terminated and recent regulatory changes which enhanced the company s earnings prospects 
the company s fiscal year losses were attributable in large part to operating losses incurred by the company s st 
louis gaming operations  the extraordinary loss recognized by the company as a result of the exchange of its senior subordinated notes and investment losses associated with both the company s tunica operations and its massena project 
moreover  regulatory changes in both missouri allowing the utilization of games of chance  including slot machines  at the company s st 
louis gaming operations and in iowa eliminating the per passenger loss and per bet limitations and permitting the company to operate primarily dockside enhanced the company s prospects of generating earnings 
in early fiscal  the company continued its strategic focus on existing income generating properties and in connection with this strategy directed investments to existing properties while pursuing efforts to find alternative uses for existing non income producing assets either through lease or sale 
in furtherance of this strategy  the company decided not to pursue the joint venture in gary  indiana 
efforts by the company to return to profitability in  though enhanced by the aforementioned regulatory changes in iowa and missouri  were hampered by flooding in missouri and increased competition in all of the company s jurisdictions 
disruptions in biloxi from the changes in completing the switch to the biloxi barge eventually fully completed in december and in iowa for the mandatory coast guard hull inspection further impacted profitability 
in the fourth quarter of  additional write offs related to the company s lease option on property in philadelphia and other vessels and gaming equipment were incurred 
furthermore  the company incurred further losses in the fourth quarter from its core operations 
given the current level of operations  the increased competition and the overall uncertainty as to the company s ability to return to profitability  management believed that the deferred tax benefits do not continue to satisfy the recognition requirements of sfas no 
accordingly  based on the uncertainty regarding the company s ability to generate future taxable income  the company established a valuation allowance of million for the deferred tax asset resulting in net income tax expense of million in fiscal year operating revenues 
the company generated consolidated operating revenues of million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
this increase was attributable to an increase in operating revenues generated by the company s st 
louis operations 
fiscal year included full scale gaming operations for the entire year 
st 
louis began gaming operations in may but was limited to games of skill until december when games of chance slot machines were added 
also  during fiscal  operating revenues in st 
louis were adversely affected by flood conditions on the mississippi river 
these flood conditions caused the company to suspend its gaming operations for a day period from may to june the company s business interruption insurance policy provided the company with million of proceeds for the period operations were impaired  which proceeds are included in st 
louis operating revenues 
the increase in operating revenues generated by st 
louis gaming operations was offset  in part  by the decrease in operating revenues from the company s biloxi gaming operations 
revenues were down the first four months of fiscal versus in biloxi due to increased competition in the market and the fact that the new competition has newer and larger casinos and are able to offer casino guests more amenities 
to offset this competitive disadvantage  the biloxi barge was placed in service on june   however  it was not fully renovated until december this provided the company with the sixth largest casino on the mississippi gulf coast  increased casino square footage and provided more slot machines and more table games 
in addition  the biloxi barge features a full service seat dining facility  not available in the previous casino 
revenues for the eight months subsequent to opening the biloxi barge trended slightly above the prior year  but were not sufficient to offset the increased cost related to the biloxi barge lease 
revenues for davenport during fiscal year were flat as compared to the previous year 
revenues in early fiscal march and april were significantly higher than the previous comparable period due to the fact that until may   iowa gaming laws included passenger bet and loss limitations and did not allow for continuous access due to cruising requirements 
revenues during fiscal year were negatively impacted as compared to fiscal year due to increased competition when a new casino commenced operations in late april in bettendorf  iowa  five miles from the davenport operations 
also  revenues were negatively impacted from november  through year end while the president was undergoing its coast guard mandated five year hull inspection and was replaced with a much smaller vessel
