item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
retail insurance activities during  the company formed cavalier insurance agency  inc cia  and during acquired blake insurance agency  inc blake  to sell various insurance products to retail purchasers of the company s homes  including  physical damage and extended home warranties 
cia and blake also sell commercial lines of insurance products  including general liability and property insurance  to the company s independent exclusive dealers and others 
at december   cia and blake had full time employees and part time employee 
wholesale dealer financing and repurchase obligations in accordance with manufactured housing industry practice  substantially all of the company s dealers finance their purchases of manufactured homes through wholesale floor plan financing arrangements 
under a typical floor plan financing arrangement  a financial institution provides the dealer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral 
the financial institution which provides financing to the dealer customarily requires the company to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution under which the company is obligated  upon default by the dealer  to repurchase the financed homes at a declining price based upon the company s original invoice price plus  in specific cases  certain administrative expenses 
a portion of purchases by dealers are pre sold to retail customers and are paid through retail financing commitments 
the risk of loss under such repurchase agreements is mitigated by the fact that i sales of the company s manufactured homes are spread over a relatively large number of independent dealers  the largest of which accounted for approximately of the company s net sales in  ii the repurchase obligation expires on individual homes after a reasonable period of time generally to months from invoice date and also declines during such period based on predetermined amounts and iii the company is in many cases able to sell homes repurchased from credit sources in the ordinary course of business without incurring significant losses 
as of december   the company s contingent liability under these repurchase and other similar recourse agreements was an amount estimated to be approximately million 
the company has provided an allowance for possible repurchase losses of  as of december l   based on prior experience and current market conditions 
management currently expects no material loss in excess of the allowance 
quality control  warranties and service the company believes the quality in materials and workmanship  continuous refinement in design and production procedures as well as price and other market factors  is an important element in the market acceptance of manufactured homes 
the company maintains a rigorous quality control inspection program at all production stages 
the company s manufacturing facilities and the plans and specifications of its manufactured homes have been approved by a hud designated inspection agency 
an independent  hud approved third party inspector checks each of the company s manufactured homes for compliance during construction 
the company provides the initial home buyer with a hud mandated  one year limited warranty against manufacturing defects in the home s construction 
warranty services after sale are performed  at the expense of the company  by local plant personnel  by independent dealers or  in certain cases  local independent contractors 
in addition to the warranty by the company  direct warranties often are provided by the manufacturers of specific components and appliances 
the company maintains a full time service manager at most of its manufacturing facilities 
in addition  the company has full time service personnel to provide on site service and correct production deficiencies that are attributable to the manufacturing process 
warranty service constitutes a significant cost to the company  and management of the company has placed emphasis on diagnosing potential problem areas to help minimize costly field repairs 
the company also has focused see safe harbor statement on page on reducing response time to customer service requests 
at december   the company had established a reserve for future warranty claims of million relating to homes sold  based upon management s assessment of historical experience factors and current industry trends 
competition the manufactured housing industry is highly competitive  characterized by low barriers to entry and severe price competition 
competition is based on price  product features and quality  reputation for service and quality  depth of field inventory  delivery capabilities  warranty repair service  dealer promotions  merchandising and terms of dealer and retail consumer financing 
the company also competes with other manufacturers  some of which maintain their own retail sales centers  for quality independent dealers 
in addition  the company s manufactured homes compete with other forms of low cost housing  including site built  prefabricated  modular homes  apartments  townhouses and condominiums 
the selection by retail buyers of a manufactured home rather than an apartment or other alternative forms of housing is significantly affected by their ability to obtain satisfactory financing 
the company faces direct competition from numerous manufacturers  many of which possess greater financial  manufacturing  distribution and marketing resources 
the company intends to increase substantially the level of retail financing provided through cac 
the company believes that increasing the level of financing by cac will have a positive impact on the company s efforts to sell its products and enhance its competitive ability within the industry 
however  due to strong competition in the retail finance segment of the industry from companies much larger than cac  combined with the limited operating history of cac  there can be no assurance that cac will be able to increase its financing or that providing this financing will have a positive impact on the company s ability to compete 
regulation the company s business is subject to a number of federal  state and local laws  regulations and codes 
construction of manufactured housing is governed by the national manufactured home construction and safety standards act of  as amended  and regulations issued thereunder by hud  which have established comprehensive national construction standards

such regulations preempt state and local regulations on such matters 
the national commission on manufactured housing has held hearings to develop recommendations relating to the regulation of the manufactured housing industry 
this commission has issued an interim report to congress which contains a number of recommendations relating to various aspects of manufactured housing regulation  including inspection  warranty and enforcement 
the company cannot presently determine what  if any  legislation may be adopted by congress or the effect any such legislation may have on the company or the manufactured housing industry as a whole 
the company s manufacturing facilities and the plans and specifications of its manufactured homes have been approved by a hud designated inspection agency 
furthermore  an independent  hud approved third party inspector regularly checks the company s manufactured homes for compliance during construction 
failure to comply with the hud regulations could expose the company to a wide variety of sanctions  including closing the company s manufacturing facilities 
the company believes its manufactured homes meet or surpass all present hud requirements 
hud has promulgated regulations with respect to structural design and wind loads and energy conservation 
the company s operations were not materially affected by the regulations  however  hud has these matters under continuous review and the company cannot predict what effect if any additional regulations promulgated by hud would have on the company or the manufactured industry as a whole 
certain components of manufactured and modular homes are subject to regulation by the us consumer product safety commission cpsc  which is empowered to ban the use of component materials believed to be hazardous to health and to require the repair of defective components 
the cpsc  the environmental protection agency and other governmental agencies are evaluating the effects of formaldehyde 
manufactured  modular and site built homes are all built with particle board  paneling and other products that contain formaldehyde resins 
since february  hud has regulated the allowable concentration of formaldehyde in certain products used in manufactured homes and required manufacturers to warn purchasers concerning formaldehyde associated risks 
the company currently uses materials in its manufactured homes that it believes meet hud standards for formaldehyde emissions and otherwise comply with hud regulations in this regard

the description and substance of the company s warranties are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations 
the company s operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  handling  emission  transportation and discharge of materials into the environment 
the company currently does not believe it will be required under existing environmental laws and enforcement policies to expend amounts which will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
however  the requirements of such laws and enforcement policies have generally become more strict in recent years 
accordingly  the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with environmental laws and enforcement policies 
a variety of federal laws affect the financing of manufactured homes  including the financing activities conducted by cac 
the consumer credit protection act truth in lending and regulation z promulgated thereunder require substantial disclosures to be made in writing to a consumer with regard to various aspects of the particular transaction  including the amount financed  the annual percentage rate  the total finance charge  itemization of the amount financed and other matters and also set forth certain substantive limitations on permissible contract terms 
the equal credit opportunity act and regulation b promulgated thereunder prohibit credit discrimination against any credit applicant based on certain prohibited bases  and also require that certain specified notices be sent to credit applicants whose applications are denied 
the federal trade commission has adopted or proposed various trade regulation rules to specify and prohibit certain unfair credit and collection practices and also to preserve consumers claims and defenses 
the government national mortgage association gnma specifies certain credit underwriting requirements in order for installment manufactured home sale contracts to be eligible for inclusion in a gnma program 
hud also has promulgated substantial disclosure and substantive regulations and requirements in order for a manufactured home installment sale contract to qualify for insurance under the federal housing authority fha program  and the failure to comply with such requirements and procedures can result in loss of the fha guaranty protection 
in addition  the financing activities of cac may also become subject to the disclosure requirements of the home mortgage disclosure act 
in addition to the extensive federal regulation of consumer credit matters  many states have also adopted consumer credit protection requirements that may impose significant requirements for consumer credit lenders 
for example  many states require that a consumer credit finance company such as cac obtain certain regulatory licenses or permits in order to engage in such business in that state  and many states also set forth a number of substantive contractual limitations regarding provisions that permissibly may be included in a consumer contract  as well as limitations upon the permissible interest rates  fees and other charges that may be imposed upon a consumer 
failure by the company or cac to comply with the requirements of federal or state law pertaining to consumer credit could result in the unenforceability of the particular contract for the affected consumer  civil liability to the affected customers  criminal liability and other adverse results
