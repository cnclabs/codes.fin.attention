non comparability vs

this resulted among other things in a each founding company being subjected to an administrative charge  b reallocation of costs  such as  for instance  common insurance being acquired for the company and its subsidiaries as a whole  and c the founding companies being relieved of the necessity of performing various administrative functions for themselves 
in  the company as a new entity began the process of merging and rationalizing operations of the previously unrelated founding companies 
for example  a olympic  orbit lightspeed and the manhattan region of click were combined into one manhattan region of the company  b the balance of click  court and american were combined into the northeast region of the company  c silver star and crown bestway were combined into the southeast region of the company  and d work was rationalized and reallocated among the former founding companies
