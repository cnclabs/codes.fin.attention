item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview intevac is a leading supplier of static sputtering systems and related manufacturing equipment used to manufacture thin film disks for computer hard disk drives 
sputtering is a complex vacuum deposition process used to deposit multiple thin film layers on a disk 
the company has three primary sources of net revenues sales of disk sputtering systems and related disk manufacturing equipment  sales of system components and contract research and development activities 
the company s disk sputtering systems  which represent the majority of the company s revenue  are sold to vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers and to original equipment manufacturers that sell disk media to disk drive manufacturers 
intevac s system component business consists primarily of sales of spare parts and after sale service to purchasers of the company s disk sputtering systems  as well as sales of components to other manufacturers of vacuum equipment 
contract research and development revenues have been primarily derived from contracts with arpa for development projects for the flat panel display industry 
through the first quarter of  the company also received revenues from sales of molecular beam epitaxy mbe systems 
mbe systems are used for the design and manufacture of materials having the characteristics of a semiconductor that are used to produce transistors  opto electronic devices and integrated circuits 
the company acquired the mbe business from varian in and sold the business to a third party in october mbe revenues in and through the first quarter of were derived from sales of used mbe equipment that had not been sold in the acquisition and from other activities in connection with the winding down of the mbe business 
the company does not expect any mbe revenues in future periods 
income loss from discontinued operations represents results from the company s sales of night vision products  primarily sales of night vision goggles and devices 
the company sold the night vision business to a third party in may the company s operating results have historically been subject to significant quarterly and annual fluctuations 
the company believes that its operating results will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis due to a variety of factors 
these factors include the cyclicality of the thin film disk manufacturing and disk drive industries  patterns of capital spending by customers  the timing of significant orders  order cancellations and shipment reschedulings  market acceptance of the company s products  unanticipated delays in design  engineering or production or in customer acceptance of product shipments  changes in pricing by the company or its competitors  the timing of product announcements or introductions by the company or its competitors  the mix of systems sold  the relative proportions of sputtering systems  system components and subassemblies  changes in product development costs  expenses associated with acquisitions and exchange rate fluctuations 
over the last eight quarters the company s operating income loss as a percentage of net revenues has fluctuated from approximately to of net revenues 
the company anticipates that its operating margin will continue to fluctuate 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the company has derived a significant proportion of its net revenues from sales of its systems to manufacturers constructing new thin film disk fabrication facilities 
the construction of new thin film disk fabrication facilities involves extremely large capital expenditures  resulting in few thin film disk fabrication facilities being constructed worldwide at any particular time 
a substantial investment is also required by disk manufacturers to install and integrate additional thin film disk manufacturing equipment in connection with upgrading or expanding their existing fabrication facilities 
these costs are far in excess of the cost of purchasing the company s system 
the magnitude of such capital expenditures has caused certain thin film disk manufacturers to forego purchasing significant additional thin film disk manufacturing equipment 
consequently  only a limited number of opportunities for the company to sell its systems may exist at any given time 
according to a march report by trendfocus  an independent market research firm  as of december  there were installed disk sputtering lines worldwide and only companies in the world with five or more installed disk sputtering lines 
therefore  winning or losing an order from any particular customer can significantly affect the company s operating results 
in addition  the company s opportunities to sell its systems are further limited by the fact that a substantial majority of the manufacturers of thin film disks have adopted an in line approach as opposed to the company s static approach to thin film disk manufacturing 
many of these manufacturers have invested significant amounts of capital in their in line systems  and as such there may be significant resistance to change to a static approach in the future 
the disk drive industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periods of oversupply  resulting in significantly reduced demand for thin film disks and for the capital equipment used to manufacture such disks  including the systems manufactured and marketed by the company 
in recent years  the disk drive industry has experienced significant growth  which  in turn  has caused significant growth in the capital equipment industry supplying manufacturers of thin film disks 
there can be no assurance that such growth will continue 
the company anticipates that a significant portion of new orders will depend upon demand from thin film disk manufacturers building or expanding fabrication facilities  and there can be no assurance that such demand will exist 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by downturns or slowdowns in the disk drive market 
due to all of the foregoing factors  the company expects its quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly and may in certain quarters be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event it is likely the price of the company s common stock would be materially adversely affected 
results of operations net revenues 
net revenues totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
net revenues increased from to primarily due to an increase in net revenues from disk sputtering systems and to a lesser extent as the result of the acquisition of sjt in may and lotus in june net revenues increased from to primarily due to a million increase in net revenues from disk sputtering systems and other components partially offset by a million decline in mbe sales

substantially all of the company s sales were denominated in us dollars 
gross margin 
gross margin for disk  flat panel and other was   and in  and  respectively 
gross margin increased in as the result of higher margins on disk sputtering systems during the first two quarters of the company believes the historical margins experienced in  and last two quarters of are more indicative of future margins than the gross margins attained in the first two quarters of gross margin for mbe was and in and  respectively 
mbe gross margin was above historical levels at in and in due to the resale at high margins of used mbe machines that the company retained after the sale of the mbe business 
research and development 
company funded research and development expense increased from million in to million in the million increase was caused primarily by an increase in expenses related to the development of disk sputtering equipment and to a lesser extent increases in net expenses related to development of flat panel manufacturing equipment  laser texturing equipment and contact stop start test equipment 
company funded research and development expense decreased from million in to million in the million decrease was caused by a million decrease in expenses related to the development of a flat panel display machine and a million decrease in mbe research and development expenses  which were partially offset by a million increase in research and development spending on disk sputtering equipment and the advanced technology division 
research and development expenses do not include costs of million  million  and million that were incurred by the company in  and  respectively  and reimbursed under the terms of a research and development cost sharing agreement with the company s japanese development partner 
at december   all of the million of funds available under this cost sharing agreement had been used 
future joint development under this agreement is contingent upon the company s ability to negotiate further amendments to the development agreement 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain further amendments to the development agreement 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of revenue 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily the result of an increase in marketing and administrative costs related to increased sales of disk sputtering systems and  to a lesser extent  increased marketing and administrative costs at the company s lotus technology division  advanced technology division  and san jose technology division  approximately  of costs related to the cancellation of its proposed secondary stock offering in august  and the increased costs of administering and insuring a public company as a result of the company s november  initial public offering 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily the result of increased marketing and administrative expenses related to increased sales of disk sputtering systems and  to a lesser extent  the increased costs of administering and insuring a public company as a result of the company s november  initial public offering 
these costs were driven by an increase in administrative headcount to support the company s increased level of business and administrative activities 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net totaled million  million  and million  in  and  respectively 
other income during consisted primarily of deferred income recognized on the sale of the company s interest in chorus corporation and interest income  and to a lesser extent early payment discounts  which were partially offset by interest expense 
other income during consisted primarily of interest income and  to a lesser extent  deferred income recognized on the sale of the company s interest in chorus corporation 
other income during resulted primarily from interest income 
discontinued operations 
in march  the company adopted a formal plan to discontinue the night vision business 
the company sold its night vision business to litton systems  inc in may accordingly  the results of operations data for the years ended december   and reflects the night vision business as a discontinued operation 
net revenues included in discontinued operations for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
income tax expense as a percentage of pretax income was  and in  and  respectively 
the company s tax rate differs from the applicable statutory rates primarily due to non deductible expenses for acquired in process research and development and goodwill amortization  state income taxes  the utilization of research and development tax credits  benefits from the company s foreign sales corporation and tax exempt interest income 
a net deferred tax asset of million is reflected in the financial statements at december  based on the company s historical taxable income and projected future earnings  management believes that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefit of this asset 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operating activities in used cash of million primarily due to aggregate increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million  which were partially offset by net income of million  million non cash expense for the write off of acquired in process research and development  million of depreciation and amortization and a million increase in customer advances 
investing activities in used cash of million due to the net investment of million of cash in the acquisitions of cathode technology corporation  san jose technology corporation  and lotus technologies  inc and the purchase of million of property and equipment which was partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of the company s chorus investment 
financing activities in generated million of cash from the proceeds of the sale of the company s common stock under its employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
at december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  the company has a million revolving line of credit which expires may  borrowings under the agreement are based on eligible receivables and inventory 
borrowings based on receivables bear interest at prime rate or the libor rate plus basis points and borrowings based on inventory bear interest at prime rate plus or the libor rate plus basis points 
borrowings under the line of credit are secured by substantially all the company s assets 
the line of credit agreement requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions 
the company intends to undertake approximately million in capital expenditures during the next months 
the company believes the existing cash and cash equivalent balances and credit facilities will be sufficient to meets its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
while operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent the company may experience growth in the future  the company anticipates that its operating and investing activities may use cash and  consequently  such growth may require the company to obtain additional sources of financing 
the company may also from time to time consider the acquisition of related businesses  products or technologies  which may require additional financing
