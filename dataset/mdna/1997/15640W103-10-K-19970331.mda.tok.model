item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
volatility of the company s common stock price 
the market for the company s common stock is highly volatile 
the trading price of the company s common stock fluctuated widely in and and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating and financial results  announcements of new products or customer contracts by the company or its competitors  litigation and other factors 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts or others could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of  or be able to confirm  revenue or earnings shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter or following the end of the quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading of the company s common stock 
finally  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in significant volatility of its common stock price 
potential dilutive effect to shareholders 
on may   a lawsuit was filed against the company and certain of its officers and directors by a holder of the company s common stock  on his own behalf and purportedly on behalf of a class of others similarly situated the class action lawsuit 
the company reached a binding settlement agreement the settlement agreement with plaintiffs counsel in the lawsuit  and gained court approval of the settlement agreement on september  as part of the settlement  the company agreed to provide up to a maximum of  shares of its common stock the settlement shares to a fund to be distributed among the members of the plaintiff class 
as of december    settlement shares had been issued and distributed  with the remaining number of settlement shares to be determined  issued and distributed according to the plan of allocation set forth in the settlement agreement 
the maximum number of additional settlement shares required by the settlement agreement is  issuance of the settlement shares is exempt from the registration requirements of section of the securities act of  as amended the securities act  pursuant to section a of the securities act  which provides for exemption of registration under the securities act for securities issued pursuant to terms and conditions which have been approved  after a hearing on the fairness of such terms and conditions  by a united states court 
as a result  the settlement shares  when issued and delivered in accordance with the settlement agreement approved by the united states district court for the northern district of california  will be fully tradeable  fully paid and non assessable 
issuance of such shares by the company will dilute the beneficial ownership of existing the company shareholders 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
from time to time  the company issues shares of common stock pursuant to its employee stock purchase plan and pursuant to options granted under its incentive stock option plan and directors stock option plan 
additional options remain outstanding and are exercisable pursuant to the company s incentive stock option plan  which terminated in july as of february   the company had reserved i an aggregate of  shares of common stock issuable to employees and consultants pursuant to its stock option plan  of which  shares are issuable upon exercise of outstanding options under such plan  ii an aggregate of  shares of common stock issuable to employees and consultants pursuant to its incentive stock option plan  of which  shares are issuable upon exercise of outstanding options under such plan  iii an aggregate of  shares of common stock issuable to employees pursuant to its employee stock purchase plan  of which  shares are available for future issuance under such plan  iv  shares of common stock issuable to non employee directors pursuant to its directors stock option plan  of which  shares are issuable upon exercise of outstanding options under such plan 
future issuance of such shares of the company s common stock pursuant to any of the foregoing company stock plans will dilute the beneficial ownership of existing company shareholders 
need for additional equity financing 
the company may be required to seek additional equity financing to meet nasdaq minimum net worth requirements and for continuing operations 
furthermore  the company must achieve a reasonable operating performance to satisfy its current and future financing needs 
during  the company completed a private debt placement with ca of approximately million 
if the company needs further financing  there can be no assurance that it will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
any additional equity financing will result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
new product risks  rapid technological change 
the markets for the company s software products and services are characterized by rapid technological developments  evolving industry standards  swift changes in customer requirements and computer operating environments  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
as a result  the success of the company depends substantially upon their ability to continue to enhance their existing products  develop and introduce in a timely manner new products incorporating technological advances and meet increasing customer expectations  all on a timely and cost effective basis 
to the extent one or more competitors introduce products that better address customer needs  the company s business could be adversely affected 
the company currently markets the following primary products centura  sqlwindows  sqlbase and sqlhost 
its strategy  including the recent change in the company s name  is centered on the successful delivery and market acceptance of its centura products 
the release of the centura line of products occurred in may the company s success will also depend on the ability of its products to perform well with existing and future leading  industry standard application software products intended to be used in connection with rdbms 
any failure to deliver these products as scheduled or their failure to achieve early market acceptance as a result of competition  technological change  failure of the company to timely release new versions or upgrades  the failure of such upgrades to achieve market acceptance or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
in addition  commercial acceptance of the company s products and services could be adversely affected by critical or negative statements or reports by industry and financial analysts concerning the company and its products  or other factors such as the company s financial performance 
if the company is unable to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to existing products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  its business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
the company depends substantially upon internal efforts for the development of new products and product enhancements 
the company has in the past experienced delays in the development of new products and product versions  which resulted in loss or delays of product revenues  and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience further delays in connection with its current product development or future development activities 
also  software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
the company has in the past discovered software errors in certain of its new products and enhancements  respectively  after their introduction 
although the company has not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such errors to date  there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in adverse product reviews and a loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
from time to time  the company or its competitors may announce new products  product versions  capabilities or technologies that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycles of the company s existing products 
the company has historically experienced increased returns of a particular product version following the announcement of a planned release of a new version of that product 
the company provides allowances for anticipated returns  and believes its existing policies result in the establishment of allowances that are adequate  and have been adequate in the past  but there can be no assurance that product returns will not exceed such allowances in the future 
the announcement of currently planned or other new products may cause customers to delay their purchasing decisions in anticipation of such products  which could have a material adverse effect on business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
see research and product development and part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
highly competitive markets 
the markets for software products such as the company s products are intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and characterized by constant demand for new product features  pressure to accelerate the release of new products and product enhancements and to reduce prices 
a number of companies currently offer products that compete directly or indirectly with one or more of the company s products 
competitors of the company include  among others  providers of sophisticated database software  originally designed and marketed primarily for use with mainframes and minicomputers  including ibm  informix corporation  ingres  oracle and sybase 
the company also faces competition from providers of pc based software products  including microsoft and borland 
these competitors offer database server products and front end tools designed for stand alone pcs but may currently or may in the future offer additional integrated pc client server software 
in addition  the company faces competition from providers of software specifically developed for the pc client server market  including front end tools offered by sybase s powersoft division  microsoft  and forte  and connectivity software competitors  such as ibi systems  inc and sybase s micro decisionware division 
the company also faces potential competition from vendors of applications development tools based on gls or case technologies 
with the emergence of the world wide web as an important platform for application development and deployment  additional competitors or potential competitors have emerged 
many of the company s competitors or potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  managerial  technical  and marketing resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed base  than the company 
a variety of potential actions by any of these competitors  including a reduction of product prices  increased promotion  announcement or accelerated introduction of new or enhanced products or features  acquisitions of software applications or technologies from third parties  the formation of strategic alliances  product giveaways or product bundling could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
the company s products experienced increased competition in and  resulting in loss of market share 
present or future competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those offered by the company or adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
such competition has in the past and may again in the future result in price reductions and or loss of market share and has in the past and may again in the future have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in particular  while the company is currently developing additional product enhancements that it believes address customer requirements  there can be no assurance that the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements will be successfully completed on a timely basis or that these product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete effectively in its markets  that competition will not intensify or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see competition 
market acceptance of pc client server systems 
substantially all of the company s revenues have been derived from the licensing of software products for pc client server systems 
licenses of such products are expected to continue to account for substantially all of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
with the increasing focus on enterprise wide systems  some customers may opt for solutions that favor mainframe or mini computer solutions 
accordingly  some companies may abandon use of pc client server systems  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s future success 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
componentized markets 
the advent of so called componentized software may alter the way in which customers buy software 
as specific software functionality can be bundled into smaller units or objects rather than in broad  highly functional products such as the company s development tools  customers may be less willing to buy such broad  highly functional products 
if such a trend continues  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to repackage and efficiently distribute its products in such componentized packages 
the costs and efforts necessary to package and distribute such components are largely unknown 
failure of the company to introduce componentized products successfully and cost effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
internet software market 
the market for internet software in general  and the segments of such market addressed by the company s products in particular  are relatively new 
the future financial performance of the company will depend in part on the continued expansion of this market and these market segments and the growth in the demand for other products developed by the company  as well as increased acceptance of the company s products by mis professionals 
there can be no assurance that the internet software market and the relevant segments of the market will continue to grow  that the company will be able to respond effectively to the evolving requirements of the market and market segments  or that mis professionals will accept the company s products 
if the company is not successful in developing  marketing  localizing and selling applications that gain commercial acceptance in these markets and market segments on a timely basis  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
see industry overview 
dependence upon distribution channels 
the company relies on relationships with value added resellers and distributors for a substantial portion of its sales and revenues 
some of the company s resellers and distributors also offer competing products 
most of the company s resellers and distributors are not subject to any minimum purchase requirements  can cease marketing the company s products at any time  and may from time to time be granted stock exchange or rotation rights 
the introduction of new and enhanced products may result in higher product returns and exchanges 
any product returns or exchanges in excess of recorded allowances could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company also maintains strategic relationships with a number of vertical software vendors and other technology companies for marketing or resale of the company s products 
any termination or significant disruption of the company s relationship with any of its resellers or distributors  or the failure by such parties to renew agreements with the company  could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
since the company has reduced its resources devoted to north american corporate sales and also decreased its expenditures on corporate and product marketing 
the company expects to rely increasingly on third party channels for sales of packaged product while focusing its corporate sales efforts on larger opportunities 
failure of the company to successfully implement  support and manage the sales strategies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
during the year ended december   no customer or distributor of the company accounted for or more of its revenues 
the distribution channels through which client server software products are sold have been characterized by rapid change  including consolidations and financial difficulties of distributors  resellers and other marketing partners including certain of the company s current distributors 
the bankruptcy  deterioration in financial condition or other business difficulties of a distributor or retailer could render the company s accounts receivable from such entity uncollectible  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that distributors will continue to purchase the company s products or provide the company s products with adequate promotional support 
failure of distributors to do so could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in a number of markets  including rapidly growing client server markets such as japan  korea  china hong kong and brazil  the company has entered into quasi exclusive multi year agreements with independent companies that have also licensed the use of the company s name 
these agreements are in place to increase the company s opportunities and penetration in such markets where the rapid adoption of client server technologies is anticipated 
while the company believes that to date these agreements have increased the company s penetration in these markets  there can be no certainty that this performance will continue nor that these relationships will remain in place 
the company s future cost of maintaining its business in these markets could increase substantially if these agreements are not renewed 
see distribution and product support 
dependence on third party organizations 
the company is increasingly dependent on the efforts of third party partners  including consultants  system houses and software developers to implement  service and support the company s products 
these third parties increasingly have opportunities to select from a very broad range of products from the company s competitors  many of whom have greater resources and market acceptance than the company 
in order to succeed  the company must actively recruit and sustain relationships with these third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in recruiting new partners or in sustaining its relationships with its existing partners 
international sales and operations 
international sales represented and of the company s net revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
a key component of the company s strategy is continued expansion into international markets  and the company currently anticipates that international sales  particularly in new and emerging markets  will continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenues 
the company will need to retain effective distributors  and hire  retain and motivate qualified personnel internationally to maintain and or expand its international presence 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully market  sell  localize and deliver its products in these international markets 
in addition to the uncertainty as to the company s ability to sustain or expand its international presence  there are certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level  such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and government controls  problems and delays in collecting accounts receivable  tariffs  export license requirements and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  political and economic instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity during summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  restrictions on the export of critical technology  and potentially adverse tax consequences  which could adversely impact the success of international operations 
sales of products by the company currently are denominated principally in us dollars 
accordingly  any increase in the value of the us dollar as compared to currencies in overseas markets would increase the foreign currency denominated cost of the company s products  which may negatively affect the company s sales in those markets 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be limited or unavailable under the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s international operations and  consequently  on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see marketing  distribution and product support customer support and service 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future performance is substantially dependent on the performance of its executive officers and key product development  technical  sales  marketing and management personnel 
the company does not have employment or non competition agreements with any of its employees except sam inman  the company s ceo and president 
the loss of the services of any executive officer or other key technical or management personnel of the company for any reason could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
the future success of the company also depends on its continuing ability to identify  hire  train  motivate and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and the company has experienced difficulty in identifying and hiring qualified engineering and software development personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future 
the inability to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel could have a material and adverse effect upon its business  operating results and financial condition 
see employees and directors and executive officers of registrant 
proprietary rights 
the success and ability of the company to compete is dependent in part upon the company s proprietary technology 
while the company relies on trademark  trade secret and copyright laws to protect its technology  the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and customer support are more essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
the company has one patent with respect to its sqlwindows and centura products 
the company believes that the ownership of patents is not presently a significant factor in its business and that its success does not depend on the ownership of patents  but primarily on the innovative skills  technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel 
also  there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to the company s technology 
the source code for the company s proprietary software is protected both as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use their products or technology without authorization  or to develop similar technology independently 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
the company generally enters into confidentiality or license agreements with its employees  consultants and vendors  and generally controls access to and distribution of its software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite efforts to protect proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that is regarded as proprietary 
policing such unauthorized use is difficult 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will prevent misappropriation of the company s technology or that such agreements will be enforceable 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce intellectual property rights  to protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by the company with respect to current or future products  and the company expects that it will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in the client server and internet connectivity software market grows and the functionality of such products overlaps with other industry segments 
in the past  the company has received notices alleging that its products infringe trademarks of third parties 
the company has historically dealt with and will in the future continue to deal with such claims in the ordinary course of business  evaluating the merits of each claim on an individual basis 
there are currently no material pending legal proceedings against the company regarding trademark infringement 
any such third party claims  whether or not they are meritorious  could result in costly litigation or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
if the company was found to have infringed upon the proprietary rights of third parties  it could be required to pay damages  cease sales of the infringing products and redesign or discontinue such products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
see intellectual property 
management of potential growth  integration of potential acquisitions 
in recent years  the company has experienced both expansion and contraction of its operations each of which has placed significant demands on the company s administrative  operational and financial resources 
to manage future growth  if any  the company must continue to improve its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and expand  train and manage its work force 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to perform such actions successfully 
the company intends to continue to invest in improving its financial systems and controls in connection with higher levels of operations 
although the company believes that its systems and controls are adequate for the current level of operations  the company anticipates that it may need to add additional personnel and expand and upgrade its financial systems to manage any future growth 
the company s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in the future  the company may make acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies 
managing acquired businesses entails numerous operational and financial risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  diversion of management s attention to other business concerns  amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively achieve growth  or manage any such growth  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
legal proceedings 
there are currently no material pending legal proceedings against the company or any of its subsidiaries  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business of the company 
the company operates  however  in a complex and volatile industry in which disputes  litigation  regulatory proceedings and other actions are a necessary risk of doing business 
there can be no assurance that the company will not participate in such legal proceedings and that the costs and charges will not have a material adverse impact on the company s future success

the company has experienced in the past and expects in the future to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s product licensing arrangements are subject to sell through revenue recognition which makes estimation of revenue dependent on reporting by the company s resellers and distributors and extremely uncertain

although the company has operated historically with little or no backlog of traditional boxed product shipments  it has experienced a seasonal pattern of product revenue decline between the fourth quarter and the succeeding first quarter  contributing to lower worldwide product revenues and operating results during such quarters 
it has generally realized lower european product revenues in the third quarter as compared to the rest of the year 
the company has also experienced a pattern of recording a substantial portion of its revenues in the third month of a quarter 
as a result  product revenues in any quarter are dependent on orders booked in the last month 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that the company s operating results for some future quarter will fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors

factors that may affect future results the company has experienced in the past and expects in the future to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company has at times recognized a substantial portion of its net revenues in the last month or last few weeks of a quarter 
the company generally ships products as orders are received and  therefore  has little or no backlog 
as a result  quarterly sales and operating results generally depend on a number of factors that are difficult to forecast  including  among others  the volume and timing of and ability to fulfill orders received within the quarter 
operating results also may fluctuate due to factors such as demand for the company s products  introduction  localization or enhancement of products by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new products  reviews in the industry press concerning the products of the company or its competitors  changes or anticipated changes in pricing by the company or its competitors  mix of distribution channels through which products are sold  mix of products sold  returns from the company s distributors and general economic conditions 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
in addition  because the company s staffing and other operating expenses are based in part on anticipated net revenues  a substantial portion of which may not be generated until the end of each quarter  delays in the receipt or shipment of orders and ability to achieve anticipated revenue levels can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in sales of the company s products in relation to the company s expectations could have an immediate adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company currently intends to increase its operating expenses to fund greater levels of research and product development  increase its sales and marketing operations and expand distribution channels 
to the extent that such expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by increased net revenues  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in the future  the company may make acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies 
managing acquired businesses entails numerous operational and financial risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  diversion of management s attention to other business concerns  amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively complete or integrate acquisitions  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
as of the date hereof  the company has no understanding or agreement with any other entity regarding any potential acquisition or combination  the consummation of which is probable
