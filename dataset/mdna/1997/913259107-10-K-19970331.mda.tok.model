year in review the unitil systems total electric kilowatt hour sales increased by in compared to electricity sales were higher for all major customer classes 
electric energy sales to large industrial and commercial customers were up substantially in  as kilowatt hour usage by this group increased 
a significant factor in this growth was the addition of major new customer loads under unitils new competitive pricing initiatives  including the energy bank tm market pricing program 
energy banktm introduced nationally competitive electricity prices to the new england region and was designed to attract new large commercial and industrial customers 
in electricity sales were also higher to unitils underlying customer sales base 
excluding sales made under special market based pricing programs  electricity sales to the systems largest commercial and industrial customers in increased  followed by an increase of in sales to residential customers 
approximately one half of the increase in sales reflects the addition of a major new customer early in under a special competitive market pricing arrangement 
in the fall of  this customer curtailed its operations to make alterations and improvements to its facility  and has informed the company that it does not expect to complete this work until mid the following table details total kilowatt hour sales in each of the last three years by major customer class kwh sales s residential    commercial    large commercial industrial    other sales    total kwh sales    unitils natural gas revenue comprises approximately of the systems total energy revenues 
firm therm sales were higher to all major customer classes in the following table details total firm therm sales in each of the last three years by major customer class firm therm sales s residential    commercial    industrial    total therm sales    total firm therm sales increased  led by a increase in gas sales to industrial customers and a increase in firm therm sales to residential customers 
this increase in gas sales was attributable to continued growth in the local and regional economy and the beneficial impact of weather conditions for gas sales relative to the prior year 
the winter heating season in the first quarter of the year was colder  as measured in heating degree days  compared to the extremely mild heating season in the system s operating costs not including fuel  purchased power and conservation program costs  which are normally recovered from customers through periodic cost recovery adjustment mechanisms increased approximately million  or in versus this increase reflects the impact of higher costs resulting from industry restructuring proceedings  development and marketing of new product offerings and expenditures on improvements to operating and customer service capabilities 
operating revenues the following table compares the major components of operating revenues for  and operating revenue s base electric revenue    fuel purchased power    conservation program costs    total electric revenue    base gas revenue    cost of gas    interruptible revenue    total gas revenue    other revenue total operating revenue    electric operating revenue increased by million  or  in compared to total electric operating revenue is comprised of electric base revenue  fuel and purchased power revenue and conservation and load management program revenue 
fuel and purchased power revenue are collected from customers through the operation of periodic cost recovery adjustment mechanisms 
changes in this component of operating revenue do not affect net income as they normally mirror corresponding changes in fuel and purchased power costs 
conservation and load management program revenue is also collected from customers through periodic cost recovery mechanisms  reflecting underlying changes in conservation and load management program costs 
electric base revenue is that portion of electric operating revenue that has a direct impact on net income 
in  electric base revenue rose by approximately million 
this increase in electric base revenue was due to the growth in the systems total kilowatt hour sales and kilowatt billing demands of and  respectively 
in  the system s electric operating revenue increased by approxi mately million  or with the electric base revenue portion increasing by approximately 
this increase in electric base revenue in  compared to  was due to the growth in the system s total electric kilowatt hour sales and kilowatt billing demands of and  respectively 
gas operating revenue increased by million  or  in compared to gas operating revenue is comprised of three components cost of gas revenue  interruptible revenue and gas base revenue 
cost of gas revenue is collected from customers through the operation of a cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
changes in this component of gas operating revenue does not affect net income as it reflects corresponding changes in gas supply costs 
interruptible revenue increased by  an increase of almost in  due to competitive prices of natural gas relative to oil throughout most of margins earned on interruptible gas sales are used to directly lower rates to firm customers through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism and do not directly impact the company s net income 
gas base revenue is that portion of gas operating revenue that has a direct impact on net income 
in  gas base revenue increased  on an overall increase of in firm therm sales  due to improving economic conditions and a colder than normal heating season in as compared to the extremely mild heating season in in  total gas operating revenue decreased by about million  or  as compared to interruptible revenue increased more than  due to very favorable spot market prices for gas in gas base revenue decreased in due to a reduction in therm sales to firm customers which primarily reflected the extremely mild heating season in other revenue declined from  in to  in the primary factor for this decline was the termination of a service agreement at the end of between unitil resources and one of its principal customers to which it provided administrative  management and power brokering services 
operating expenses fuel and purchased power reflects the cost of fuel used in electric generation and wholesale energy and capacity purchased to meet the unitil system s electric energy requirements 
fuel and purchased power expenses normally recoverable from customers through periodic cost recovery adjustment mechanisms increased million  or in compared to the change reflects an increase in the system s total energy requirements in  coupled with higher fossil fuel costs 
the combined resource portfolio of the unitil system is comprised of a variety of power supply sources  including owned generation  utility purchase power contracts and purchases from non utility generators 
the unitil system s total energy supply resources for were comprised of from subsidiary owned generation  from various utility purchased power contracts  and representing purchases from non utility generation units 
in compared to  fuel and purchase power expenses increased million  or 
purchased gas reflects gas purchased and made to supply the system s total gas energy requirements 
purchased gas is normally recoverable from customers through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
purchased gas costs increased by approximately million or in as compared to  reflecting the higher cost of gas available in the marketplace and an increase in therms purchased 
purchased gas decreased by  or in as compared to  based on a lower cost of gas  partially offset by an increase in therms purchased for interruptible sales 
under order  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has allowed gas pipeline suppliers to recover prudently incurred costs resulting from the transition into a deregulated environment 
the company s combination gas electric utility operating subsidiary  has been incurring ferc approved transition charges from its natural gas pipeline supplier since through the end of  the amount of transition costs incurred by the company totaled approximately million 
these costs are being recovered directly from gas customers through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
on the basis of estimates included in rate filings before the ferc and other publicly available information  the company currently estimates that it may incur up to an additional  of transition costs in future years 
the company expects full recovery of these costs through billings to customers 
operation and maintenance expense  which include conservation and load management c lm program and purchase power related expenditures  increased by approximately million  or in compared to the increase primarily reflects higher operating expenses in support of the companies utility operations  regulatory activities and new business initiatives 
in  operation and maintenance expense increased by approximately  or 
this increase primarily reflected higher conservation and load management program expenditures 
in  expenditures on this component of operation and maintenance expenses was over million a increase over s conservation and load management program expenditure level 
excluding these costs  the system s total operating and maintenance costs were relatively unchanged in compared to depreciation  amortization and taxes depreciation expense increased more than for over the prior year due primarily to a higher level of plant in service 
amortization of the cost of abandoned properties principally relates to the abandonment of an investment in the seabrook nuclear power plant by the company s massachusetts retail operating subsidiary 
a portion of the former investment in this project is being recovered in rates to electric customers as allowed by the massachusetts department of public utilities 
federal and state income taxes increased in compared to by  this result reflects higher net income before taxes in and the absence of a nonrecurring tax benefit realized by the company in from a donation of land to an economic development project in fitchburg  massachusetts 
despite an increase in net income before taxes  federal and state income taxes remained relatively unchanged in  primarily reflecting the impact of a nonrecurring tax benefit realized by the company from the above mentioned land donation 
local property taxes increased  or  in this increase mainly reflects the annual property tax increases set by local communities 
local property taxes increased in  compared to by 
non operating income expenses non operating income expenses in represent income of approximately  primarily reflecting the additional funds received in settlement of an eminent domain taking by the state of new hampshire of the companys former corporate headquarters for a highway expansion project  offset by other non operating expenses 
interest expenses interest expense  net increased in over  due to an increase in short term borrowings 
this increase in short term borrowings reflects the timing difference between required payments for fuel  purchase power and purchase gas costs and the recovery of these cost from customers through periodic cost recovery mechanisms 
increased short term borrowing in was also related to the interim construction financing of the companys new corporate headquarters 
the company anticipates that it will complete a permanent long term financing of its headquarters in the first half of interest expense remained relatively unchanged in compared to capital requirements and liquidity the unitil system requires capital for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment in order to improve  protect  maintain and expand its electric and gas distribution systems  to develop and market new energy related products and to improve customer service operations and capabilities 
the capital necessary to meet these requirements is derived primarily from the company s retained earnings and through the system s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
when internally generated funds are not available  it is the company s policy to borrow interim funds on a short term basis to meet the capital requirements of its subsidiaries and  when necessary  to repay short term debt through the issuance of permanent financing 
the size and timing of such financings depend on developments in the securities markets  the ability to meet certain financing covenants and the receipt of appropriate regulatory approval 
the company attempts to maintain a conservative capitalization structure  which contributes to both the stability of unitil and its ability to market new securities 
the company has been able to access the financial markets to meet its capital requirements and does not anticipate a change in its access to  or the availability of  capital in the coming year 
cash flow from operations decreased by million in after increasing by million in over one half of the change in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was the result of a million increase in the timing difference between the payment on fuel  purchased power and purchased gas costs and the corresponding recovery of these costs in revenue billed under periodic cost recovery mechanisms 
the balance of the decrease reflects other changes in the companys working capital requirements as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
operating activities s net cash provided by operating activities    cash flow from investing activities increased approximately million in compared to  reflecting a million increase in planned spending for utility system improvements as well as million increase in expenditures for the construction of the companys new corporate headquarters 
the company also received cash payments of  and million from the state of new hampshire in and  respectively  related to the eminent domain taking of is former corporate headquarters for a highway expansion project 
investing activities s net cash used in investing activities    in  total capital expenditures are expected to approximate million 
this projection reflects normal capital expenditures for system expansions  replacements and other improvements 
the change in cash flows from financing activities in compared to reflects an increase in short term borrowing requirements 
higher short term borrowings in were primarily due to funding of the timing difference between payments on fuel  purchased power and purchased gas costs and the corresponding recovery of these costs in revenue billed under periodic cost recovery mechanisms as well as the interim construction financing of the companys new corporate headquarters 
the company anticipates that it will complete a permanent long term financing of its headquarters building in the first half of short term borrowing requirements are met through unitil s short term credit facilities with four different banks 
financing activities s net cash provided by used in financing activities    during  the company raised  of additional common equity capital through the issuance of  shares of common stock in connection with the dividend reinvestment and tax deferred savings and investment plans 
the company raised  of additional common equity capital in and  of additional equity capital in  through the respective issuance of  and  shares of common stock in connection with these plans

regulatory matters competition and restructuring regulatory activity in both new hampshire and massachusetts has focused on the restructuring of the electric industry and the process of deregulating the retail sale of electric energy 
in both states  january  has been targeted as the beginning of competition  or choice date 
under these restructuring proposals  customers would be allowed to choose their supplier of electricity from the competitive market  and have their local utility deliver that electricity over its distribution systems at regulated rates 
unitil has been preparing for this restructuring by developing transition plans that will move its utility subsidiaries into this new market structure in a way that will ensure fairness in the treatment of the companys assets and obligations that are dedicated to the current regulated franchises and  at the same time  provide choice for all customers 
simultaneous with this transition process for unitils regulated utilities  the company is moving to position its competitive market subsidiary  unitil resources  inc  to pursue growth areas both within and beyond the companys traditional franchises in all energy related sectors  including electricity  gas  oil and propane 
new hampshire in new hampshire  house bill hb was signed into law by the governor in may hb establishes principles  standards and a timetable for the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc to implement full  open retail electric competition as early as january   but no later than july  the bill also directs the nhpuc to set interim access charges for the recovery of above market stranded power supply costs and to make a final determination on these access charges within two years of implementation of full competition 
as required by hb  the nhpuc has set a procedural schedule for opening up the state to retail competition 
in connection with that procedural schedule  the company has filed with the nhpuc its customer choice plan a transition plan that guarantees electric consumers open access to the retail energy supply market in new hampshire 
under this plan  all of the companys new hampshire customers will continue to enjoy unitils very competitive electric rates  among the lowest in new england  and also may benefit from future market competition and the resulting energy savings 
unitils customer choice plan guarantees all its customers competitive retail delivery prices  open and nondiscriminatory access to competitive electricity suppliers  reliable electric service and comprehensive consumer protection standards 
the companys customer choice plan achieves these benefits and safeguards for consumers while providing for full recovery of unitils obligations that are dedicated to serving customers in the companys new hampshire franchises 
on february   the nhpuc issued its final plan for restructuring the electric utility industry in new hampshire 
concurrently  the nhpuc issued five supplemental orders establishing interim stranded cost charges for each of the states electric utilities  including concord electric company ceco and exeter hampton electric company e h  unitils new hampshire based electric distribution operating companies 
the final plan and related orders include a number of complex regulatory and market restructuring issues which the company is currently evaluating 
among other things  the final plan and orders provide for the recovery of cecos and e hs stranded costs related to their purchase power obligations and requires them to terminate the system agreement under which they currently purchase all their power supply requirements from unitil power corp 
the termination provisions of the system agreement permit termination by any party thereto on seven years prior written notice 
on march   northeast utilities  the parent company of public service company of new hampshire  filed a suit in united states district court in concord  new hampshire  to enjoin implementation of the final plan 
at this time the company is unable to predict the ultimate impact that the final plan and related orders will have on the company  or the likely result of the northeast utilities lawsuit 
in june  the new hampshire retail competition pilot program pilot program  mandated by legislation enacted a year earlier  became operational 
during the two year term of the pilot program  up to or some  electric consumers are allowed to choose from competing electric suppliers  and have this supply delivered across the local utility system 
more than thirty electric suppliers  including unitil resources  the companys competitive market subsidiary  are currently authorized to market electricity to pilot program participants 
unitil resources began competitive marketing efforts in may  and began making sales in june 
under the pilot program  the nhpuc initially ordered concord electric company and exeter hampton electric company  unitils new hampshire based distribution companies  to file tariffs which included a discount to encourage participation and a mechanism to protect nonparticipants from any adverse cost consequences resulting from changes in power supply obligations 
both these tariff items would have had a significant impact on the ability of the company to recover its power supply obligations 
however  after filing for reconsideration of the nhpucs order  the company entered into a settlement agreement with the nhpuc staff and the office of the consumer advocate which provides the company an opportunity to mitigate any losses which may result under the pilot program 
the settlement was approved by the nhpuc on july  the company also recorded in  a one time charge to earnings for estimated losses relating to pilot program operations 
massachusetts in march  the massachusetts department of public utilities mdpu issued a notice of inquiry rulemaking  opening a new phase in its investigation on the restructuring of the electric utility industry in massachusetts 
throughout the mdpu conducted a comprehensive information gathering effort  including holding numerous legislative style public hearings 
on december   the mdpu issued a document entitled electric utility restructuring plan model rules and legislative proposal 
in this document the mdpu presented its framework  model rules and proposed legislation for a restructured electric utility industry 
on february   the massachusetts governor filed legislation for electric industry restructuring which is generally consistent with the mdpus proposal 
the mdpus proposed rules provide transition measures to accomplish the change from a regulated industry to a competitive market  as early as january  these measures include consumer safety and reliability standards  environmental protection measures and a reasonable framework for the recovery of utilities stranded costs related to generation investments and purchased power obligations 
included in the proposed rules and regulations is the requirement that each electric utility file unbundled rates  that is  separate rate components for distribution  transmission and generation services and for access to the competitive supplier market 
the mdpu has identified the unbundling of rates as critical to provide both customers and competitors with the information they need to make decisions in a more competitive environment 
the mdpu has required that the unbundled rates be revenue neutral for the company  for each rate class  and for each customer 
the company is required to submit unbundled rates by march  to become effective on or after july  the mdpu has been supportive of the settlement process as a way to expedite electric utility restructuring in massachusetts 
on february   the mdpu approved a restructuring plan filed by the massachusetts attorney general  the massachusetts division of energy resources and numerous other parties in the context of a settlement agreement with the states largest investor owned utility 
under this plan  consumers will be allowed to choose an electricity suppler beginning as early as january   and are guaranteed a savings on their electric bills 
the plan requires the utility to divest itself of ownership of all its generation plant  and provides the utility with the opportunity to fully recover its stranded costs 
it is likely that several restructuring offers of settlement will be filed in the first half of by other massachusetts electric utilities 
the company is currently developing a transition plan for its massachusetts utility subsidiary and exploring the use of the settlement process to expedite the restructuring process 
rate cases the last formal regulatory hearings to increase base rates for unitil s three retail operating subsidiaries occurred in for concord electric company  for fitchburg gas and electric light company and for exeter hampton electric company 
a majority of the system s operating revenues are collected under various periodic rate adjustment mechanisms including fuel  purchased power  cost of gas and conservation program cost recovery mechanisms 
millstone unit no 
unitils massachusetts operating subsidiary  fitchburg gas and electric light company fg e  has a ownership in the millstone unit no 
millstone nuclear generating unit which supplies it with mw of electric capacity 
in january the nuclear regulatory commission nrc placed millstone on its watch list as a category facility  which calls for increased nrc inspection attention 
in march the nrc requested additional information about the operation of the unit from northeast utilities nu  the units managing owner 
as a result of an engineering evaluation completed by nu  millstone was taken out of service on march  the nrc later informed nu  in a letter dated june   that it had reclassified millstone as a category facility 
the nrc assigns this rating to plants which it deems to have significant weaknesses that warrant maintaining the plant in shutdown condition until the operator demonstrates that adequate programs have been established and implemented to ensure substantial improvement in the operation of the plant 
the nrc s letter also informed nu that this designation would require the nrc staff to obtain nrc approval by vote prior to a restart of the unit 
the company cannot predict when millstone will be allowed by the nrc to restart  but believes that the unit will remain shut down for a protracted period of time 
during the period that millstone is out of service  fg e will continue to incur its proportionate share of the units ongoing operations and maintenance o m costs  and may incur additional o m costs and capital expenditures to meet nrc requirements 
fg e will also incur costs to replace the power that was expected to be generated by the unit 
during the outage fg e has been recovering approximately  per month in replacement power costs through its fuel adjustment clause  which is subject to periodic review by the mdpu 
environmental the company continues to work with federal and state environmental agencies to identify and assess environmental issues at two former gas manufacturing sites  the sawyer passway sawyer passway and logan street logan street sites  operated by fitchburg gas and electric light company  the company s combination gas and electric operating subsidiary 
in december the company accepted a tier b permit from the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep to address the sawyer passway site in fitchburg  massachusetts pursuant to the requirements of the massachusetts contingency plan 
a supplemental phase ii field investigation was conducted at the site in july and august of results of the investigation confirm  in the phase ii investigation report the report  the presence of some contamination  however  the report indicates the identified contamination does not present an imminent hazard to health  safety or the environment 
the phase ii investigation report and the risk characterization was submitted to the dep on january  phase iii  the identification and selection of comprehensive remedial action alternatives  has been delayed until june  to permit investigation of redevelopment alternatives on this site 
the company also conducted a phase i assessment of the logan street site on april  results of that investigation suggest that there is some evidence of both groundwater and soil contamination 
the site was numerically ranked using the massachusetts contingency plan numerical ranking system scoresheet and was classified as a tier ii site 
currently  site closeout options are being investigated 
the costs of such assessments and any remedial action determined to be necessary will initially be funded from traditional sources of capital and recovered from customers under a rate recovery mechanism approved by the massachuestts department of public utilities 
the company also has a number of liability insurance policies that may provide coverage for environmental remediation at this site 
because these investigations are at an early stage management cannot  at this time  predict the costs of future analysis and remediation 
new accounting standards during  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement requires a review of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the financial position of the company
