per share in a 
o 
smith corporation has paid dividends on its common stock for consecutive years 
results of operations sales from continuing operations in were million surpassing sales of by percent 
sales in were million 
despite a slow start  proved to be another solid year as each of the corporation s operating companies increased its sales over the prior year 
the most significant sales improvement occurred in the corporation s storage fluid handling technologies segment as a result of the tectank acquisition made in december of this subsidiary which manufactures bolted steel tanks and shop welded steel  stainless steel and aluminum tanks provided approximately million of the year to year increase in sales 
the corporation s larger two segments  electric motor technologies and water systems technologies each reflected sales increases over the prior year of approximately six percent 
on january  the corporation announced it had reached a definitive agreement with tower automotive inc to sell all the assets of automotive products company apc excluding the investment in its mexican affiliate  metalsa  s 
a 
 which is expected to be sold within one year 
due to the pending sale  apc and metalsa have been accorded discontinued operations treatment in the accompanying financial statements 
sales in including apc s sales of million amounted to billion  an increase over of percent 
the corporation s gross profit margin for continuing operations in was percent  compared with percent in and percent in the favorable trend in margins was due largely to the higher manufacturing volumes  increased capacity utilization and improved operating efficiencies in the electric motor technologies segment 
the gross margin for the water systems technologies segment also reflected improvement over the prior two years as a result of higher volume in which more than offset the unfavorable impact of industry wide pricing pressures which were prevalent throughout the first half of the year 
partially offsetting the favorable trend in the corporation s overall margin was a deterioration in the storage fluid handling technologies margin 
this deterioration resulted from declining volumes for the relatively higher margin fiberglass pipe produced for the service station market by the smith fiberglass subsidiary 
sales for the electric motor technologies segment in increased almost million or percent to a record million from sales of million 
sales in were million 
demand for hermetic motor products associated with the heating  ventilating and air conditioning hvac industry provided most of the increase in sales over the past two years 
the replacement market for air conditioning equipment was responsible for much of the growth in the hermetic motor business as a growing percentage of the existing unitary air conditioning equipment in the marketplace is at or near the end of its life cycle 
in addition  the use of new refrigerants and higher efficiency compressors has combined to encourage the replacement of older commercial air conditioning and refrigeration installations 
continued growth in exports of compressors by the company s customers also bolstered hermetic volume 
earnings for the electric motor technologies segment in were million or percent higher than the million earned in earnings in were million 
while increased volume was one of the major factors responsible for the significant improvement in earnings over the past three years  other factors were also important 
commencing in the company began concentrating production in its lower cost facilities while making significant capital investments in new equipment 
these factors enabled this segment to efficiently handle higher manufacturing volumes while continuing to improve productivity 
sales for the water systems technologies segment were million in increasing percent from million in and establishing a record for the fifth consecutive year 
sales in were million 
the record sales in were achieved through domestic growth in both the residential and commercial water heater market 
the company s residential volume increase corresponded to the growth in the overall domestic market which experienced growth of approximately percent in the strong domestic economy and an active construction market resulted in commercial water heater unit volume increasing in excess of six percent in while the domestic market expanded in  economic weakness in europe and canada resulted in lower sales in both of these markets compared to the prior year 
segment sales in demonstrated only a slight increase from due to an announced price increase effective as of january  the price increase caused a shift in demand to the fourth quarter of thereby reducing demand in although water systems technologies sales increased percent in  the earnings increase was minimal  increasing from million in to million in earnings were million 
in  the earnings contribution from higher sales was offset by higher selling expense as well as transition costs associated with moving to an outside sales organization 
earnings increased seven percent from to despite only a percent increase in sales 
earnings benefited from increased volume of higher margin commercial product which more than offset the adverse impact of lower volume and pricing for residential water heaters 
the corporation s storage fluid handling technologies segment is a combination of two business units  engineered storage products and fiberglass products 
total sales for this segment reflected a million increase over sales of million 
this increase was directly attributable to the aforementioned acquisition of tectank which was completed in december of sales in were million 
total earnings for this segment declined from million in to million in and rose slightly in to million 
the decline in earnings from to was due to lower earnings at fiberglass products 
in  the addition of tectank s earnings compensated for a further decline in earnings at fiberglass products 
the corporation continued to liquidate the portfolio of agristor credit corporation in the net operating results of this finance subsidiary are no longer integrated as part of the business segments of the corporation and are included in general corporate expense with interest expense consolidated with the corporation s total interest expense 
interest costs and administrative expenses have declined throughout the liquidation process and are not significant to the total corporation s performance 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expense for the corporation in was million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
approximately one third of the increase from to was attributable to the consolidation of sg a associated with the acquisition of tectank 
other major reasons for the increase in include increased commissions and other expenses in support of additional sales volume as well as costs incurred relative to establishing joint venture operations in china 
as a percent of sales  sg a was percent in  percent in and percent in interest expense  net of the amount allocated to discontinued operations was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations based on the ratio of net assets discontinued to total consolidated net assets of the corporation 
interest expense before allocation to apc rose throughout the three year reporting period 
this upward trend in interest expense before allocation was a function of increasing interest rates and rising debt levels to support aggressive capital spending programs at apc 
since apc s assets represented a greater proportion of the corporation s total net assets each year due to its capital spending program  their allocated interest expense increased each year 
earnings from continuing operations were million or per share in compared to million or per share in earnings demonstrated improvement over despite nearly million of losses and other administrative costs to establish the corporation s joint ventures in china 
the corporation earned million or 
per share in outlook the corporation projects sales growth from continuing operations before acquisitions to range between five and ten percent compared with the corporation s electric motor technologies segment expects to benefit from continued strong growth in the heating  ventilating  air conditioning and refrigeration hvac r market as well as improved demand in its general industries business unit 
water systems is projecting continued penetration of the commercial water heater market as well as stronger market growth for residential water heaters 
the storage fluid handling segment expects to benefit from increased capital spending for industrial storage products as well as increased demand for chemical and industrial pipe 
other matters environmental the corporation s operations are governed by a number of federal  state and local environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials  the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the corporation or third parties 
the corporation has expended substantial financial and managerial resources complying with such laws 
however  expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in and are not expected to be material in any single year 
although the corporation believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with such laws and maintains procedures designed to maintain compliance  there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future 
however  since the corporation s competitors are governed by the same laws  the corporation should not be placed in a competitive disadvantage 
forward looking statements certain statements in this report are forward looking statements 
although the corporation believes that its expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business  there can be no assurance that the corporation s financial goals will be realized 
although a significant portion of the corporation s sales are derived from the replacement of previously installed product and such sales are therefore less volatile  numerous factors may affect the corporation s actual results and may cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the corporation 
among such numerous factors the corporation includes the continued strong growth of the worldwide heating  ventilating and air conditioning market  the stability of the pricing environment for residential water heaters and the successful implementation of the corporation s joint venture strategies in china
