virazole r is used in aerosol form to treat infants hospitalized with severe respiratory infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus rsv and is the only antiviral therapeutic for this infection 
rsv is a seasonal illness which occurs primarily in late fall through early spring 
early in the season  the number of hospital admissions and positive cultures for rsv suggested a heavy incidence of infection 
however  the severity of infection in this season was not as high as the prior seasons nor as heavy as such earlier evidence indicated resulting in a lower hospital demand for virazole r and consequently an increased level of inventory at the wholesale level 
the increased wholesale inventory levels combined with trends in the industry toward managed health care during the first part of the season adversely impacted total virazole r sales despite additional sales promotional efforts which included more favorable credit terms and sales discounts 
additionally  sales of virazole r may have been and may continue to be affected by a january change in the american academy of pediatrics guidelines for the use of virazole r in rsv from should be used to may be considered 
future sales may also be impacted by the severity of the next rsv season and the increased level of inventory still remaining at the wholesale level as well as by a recently approved product designed to prevent rsv 
sales of virazole r in the first quarter of are expected to be negligible compared to  in the first quarter of due to the fact that rsv is a seasonal disease  virazole r sales from year to year are subject to the incidence and severity of the disease which cannot be predicted with certainty

margins will begin to improve after a devaluation if price increases are obtained and when older  higher priced inventory is replaced with inventory manufactured after the devaluation 
icn yugoslavia s gross margins for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of were   and  respectively 
additionally  the gross profit margin of the newly acquired companies of leksredstva  polypharm and alkaloida   and  respectively  also contributed to the relative decline

the company expects to incur significant pre launch marketing expenses over the next two years 
these efforts may cause the ratio of selling  general and administrative expenses to sales to increase during this period of time resulting from additional expenses without immediate incremental revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of sales in compared to  or of sales in this increase was primarily due to higher operating expenses at icn yugoslavia resulting from inflationary pressures and the impact of a full year of biomedical operations in compared to two months of biomedical operations in the biomedical selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were compared to for the pharmaceutical business

the company operates in many regions where the tax rate is low or it benefits from a tax holiday 
in yugoslavia  the company benefited from tax credits arising from the acquisition of icn yugoslavia and in russia the tax rate was low due to special tax relief afforded to pharmaceutical companies 
in  the company recorded a tax benefit of  primarily resulting from the favorable outcome of tax audits and the tax benefit from the company s current year tax loss in the u 
s which was carried back to prior tax years resulting in the recovery of taxes previously paid 
this trend of low tax rates may not continue in the future 
the special tax relief for russia applied to only in  the company benefited from a devaluation of icn yugoslavia s tax liability balances  utilization of construction tax credits in yugoslavia and the revaluation of the company s deferred tax assets

in  certain tax benefits that were acquired in the acquisition of icn yugoslavia will expire 
the expiration of these tax benefits will raise the overall effective tax rate for icn yugoslavia 
however  this increase may be partially offset by tax credits provided by yugoslavia for plant construction

product liability in december  the company discontinued product liability insurance in the united states 
while to date  no material adverse claim for personal injury resulting from allegedly defective products has been successfully maintained against the company  a substantial claim  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial performance

demands on liquidity management believes that funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its normal operating requirements during the coming year 
the company s recent acquisitions in hungary  russia and china will require  of cash in also  if the historic rate of growth in eastern europe continues  these operations will require increasing levels of working capital and funds for additional facilities or upgrading of existing facilities 
additionally  the company has several preliminary acquisition prospects that may require significant funds in management believes that funds generated from operations will not be sufficient for all of these needs and will seek refinancing of existing short term debt  some of which was assumed in the acquisitions  and additional financing through debt or equity issues  although there can be no assurance that the company can raise additional funds 
inflation and changing prices foreign operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including price and currency exchange controls  fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  political instability and restrictive governmental actions 
changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may  in certain instances  materially affect the company s results of operations 
the effect of these risks remains difficult to predict 
during the last three years  the cumulative inflation rate in mexico has exceeded 
starting in  the company will begin translating the financial statements of its operations in mexico using accounting methods that apply to hyperinflationary economies 
at december   mexico had a net monetary asset position of  which would be subject to loss if a devaluation were to occur 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company is subject to foreign currency risk on its foreign denominated debt of  which is primarily denominated in swiss francs  at december  and to devaluation losses on net monetary assets positions in yugoslavia and russia 
see icn yugoslavia below and note of notes to consolodated financial statements for further discussion 
at december   the net monetary asset position of the company s russian operations was  which would be subject to a loss if a devaluation were to occur 
the effects of inflation are experienced by the company through increases in the costs of labor  services and raw materials 
the company is subject to price control restrictions on its pharmaceutical products in the majority of countries in which it operates 
while the company attempts to raise selling prices in anticipation of inflation  the company has been affected by the lag in allowed price increases in yugoslavia and mexico  which has created lower sales in us dollars and reductions in gross profit 
future sales and gross profit could be materially affected if the company is unable to obtain price increases commensurate with the levels of inflation 
from a global perspective the russian pharmaceutical market and the united states market are unique in that pharmaceutical prices are not heavily regulated by the government 
icn yugoslavia icn yugoslavia  a owned subsidiary  operates in a business environment that is subject to significant economic volatility and political instability 
the current economic trend in yugoslavia is toward unfavorable economic conditions that includes continuing liquidity problems  inflation and monetary exposures  potential devaluation  government spending limitations  credit risk  political instability  sanctions and price controls 
the future of the economic and political environment of yugoslavia is uncertain and could deteriorate to the point that a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations could occur 
the company is pursuing actions to reduce its monetary exposure 
these actions include converting  of dinar denominated receivables from the government into a one year note  with interest at libor plus 
the note would be in dinars equivalent to  at the time of payment 
the company is currently seeking to convert an additional  of receivables into a one year note payable in dinars equivalent to  yugoslavia is subject to political instability 
with presidential and parliamentary elections taking place later in and with the potential for continued economic deterioration  political instability may continue 
management believes that the elections may result in political change that would lead to economic reform 
management believes that economic reform and privatization is necessary before the yugoslavian economy will improve 
the lifting of sanctions has provided opportunities to export outside of yugoslavia  however  yugoslavia has not fully recovered the international status it held before sanctions 
the yugoslavian government is still negotiating to regain membership in the international monetary fund and world bank
