overview since inception  the company has experienced generally increasing annual sales as interest in bone diseases  such as osteoporosis  has grown  as new drug therapies have become available in the united states and other countries to treat these diseases and as the use of dxa systems to measure bone density has become more widespread 
in fiscal  sales of the company s x ray bone densitometers reached record levels  especially in the united states as the clinical use of bone densitometers continued to expand 
the company introduced the first dual energy x ray absorptiometry dxa bone densitometer in and continued with a string of new product advancements including the introduction of the fourth generation clinically oriented acclaim series of bone densitometers in fiscal in fiscal and  acclaim sales represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s total dxa sales 
the company has achieved a slightly higher gross margin on this product line because of higher selling prices and lower overall manufacturing costs than the older dxa line 
in july  the company began international shipments of sahara  a completely dry ultrasound bone sonometer system that does not require water as a coupling medium like the other competitive devices 
on august   the company acquired all of the common stock of fluoroscan imaging systems  inc fluoroscan  an industry leader in the field of mini c arm imaging systems 
all results have been restated to reflect the acquisition of fluoroscan in a pooling of interests transaction 
all share and per share data have also been retroactively restated to reflect a for stock split that occurred on march  the company believes that future growth will be in part conditional upon the success of sales of sahara  especially in the united states to the primary care market subject to completion of the fda approval process 
in august  the company received a unanimous recommendation of approval for sahara by the fda s radiology advisory panel 
the availability of reimbursement to healthcare providers for bone density measurements of patients continues as an important factor in the attractiveness of the company s bone densitometers

total revenues were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  total revenues increased compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in the total number of dxa product shipments in the united states  europe and latin america 
the current year increase in dxa product revenues of in these markets were partially offset by fewer sales in asia and  to a lesser extent  by decreased sales of mini c arm imaging systems

the company expects that foreign sales in the current fiscal year will continue to account for a substantial portion of product sales 
continued economic and currency related uncertainty in a number of foreign countries  especially in asia and latin america  could reduce the company s future sales to these markets 
in particular  the demand for bone densitometry systems has slowed considerably in japan due to an increasing level of maturity in this market and  to a lesser extent  the uncertain economic conditions that currently exist in that country 
costs and expenses 
the cost of product sales decreased as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal and from in fiscal these costs decreased as a percentage of product sales primarily due to i increased shipments of the latest family of dxa bone densitometers  the acclaim series  which earns a better gross margin than the company s older dxa systems  ii a volume increase in the number of dxa systems sold resulting in certain manufacturing efficiencies and iii an increase in sales by the company s direct sales force primarily in the united states which results in higher average selling prices 
partially offsetting these decreases were increased costs and lower sales relating to mini c arm systems
