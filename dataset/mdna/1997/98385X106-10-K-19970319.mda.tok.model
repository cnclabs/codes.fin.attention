item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  general product prices 
federal and state regulations there have been  and continue to be  numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the oil and gas industry that are often changed in response to the current political or economic environment 
compliance with this regulatory burden is often difficult and costly and may carry substantial penalties for noncompliance 
the following are some specific regulations that may affect the company 
the company cannot predict the impact of these or future legislative or regulatory initiatives 
federal regulation of natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal regulation  including transportation rates charged and various other matters  by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the company s gathering system and mile pipeline have been declared exempt from ferc jurisdiction  and ferc has allowed the company to provide gathering service on a non regulated basis 
federal wellhead price controls on all domestic gas were terminated on january  the company cannot predict the impact of government regulation on any natural gas facilities 
in  ferc issued orders nos 
and a  requiring operators of pipelines to unbundle transportation services from sales services and allow customers to pay for only the services they require  regardless of whether the customer purchases gas from such pipelines or from other suppliers 
the united states court of appeals upheld the unbundling provisions and other components of ferc s orders but remanded several issues to ferc for further explanation 
on february   ferc issued order no 
c  addressing the court s concern 
ferc s orders remain subject to judicial review and may be changed as a result of that review 
although ferc s regulations should generally facilitate the transportation of gas produced from the company s properties and the direct access to end user markets  the impact of these regulations on marketing the company s production or on its gas transportation business cannot be predicted 
the company  however  does not believe that it will be affected any differently than other natural gas producers and marketers with which it competes 
federal regulation of oil sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 
the net price received from the sale of these products is affected by market transportation costs 
a significant part of the company s oil production is transported by pipeline 
the energy policy act of required the ferc to adopt a simplified ratemaking methodology for interstate oil pipelines 
in and  the ferc issued order nos 
and a  adopting rules that establish new rate methods for such pipelines 
under the new rules  effective january   interstate oil pipelines can change rates based on an inflation index  though other rate mechanisms may be used in specific circumstances 
the united states court of appeals upheld ferc s orders in the company cannot predict the effect these rules may have on the cost of moving oil to market 
state regulation the oil and gas operations of the company are subject to various types of regulation at the state and local levels 
such regulation includes requirements for drilling permits  the method of developing new fields  the spacing and operations of wells and waste prevention 
the production rate may be regulated and the maximum daily production allowable from oil and gas wells may be established on a market demand or conservation basis 
these regulations may limit the company s production from its wells and the number of wells or locations the company can drill 
the company may become party to agreements relating to the construction or operations of pipeline systems for the transportation of natural gas 
to the extent that such gas is produced  transported and consumed wholly within one state  such operations may in certain instances be subject to the state s administrative authority charged with regulating pipelines 
the rates the company could charge for gas  the transportation of gas  and the construction and operation of such pipelines would be subject to the regulations governing such matters 
certain states are considering regulations with respect to gathering systems 
the company cannot predict whether any rules will be adopted or  if adopted  the effect these rules may have on the gathering systems owned by the company 
federal  state or indian leases the company s operations on federal  state or indian oil and gas leases are subject to numerous restrictions  including nondiscrimination statutes 
such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the bureau of land management  minerals management service and other agencies 
environmental regulations various federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  directly impact oil and gas exploration  development and production operations  and consequently may impact the company s operations and costs 
management believes that the company is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
to date  the company has not expended any material amounts to comply with such regulations  and management does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company

product prices 
oil and gas prices are affected not only by supply and demand factors  but are also subject to substantial seasonal  political and other fluctuations that are generally beyond the ability of the company to control or predict 
crude oil prices are generally affected by global politics and supply  particularly among opec members 
despite the anticipation of and eventual resumption of iraqi exports  oil prices reached their highest levels since the persian gulf war in the average posted price per barrel of west texas intermediate wti oil  a benchmark crude  was  and in  and  respectively 
posted wti prices fluctuated in between a monthly average low of and high of 
the average posted wti price for january and february was 
improvement in oil prices from to have generally been attributed to global economic growth and diminished excess production capacity 
crude oil prices in will continue to largely depend on these factors 
based on production  the company estimates that a per barrel increase or decrease in the average oil sales price would result in approximately a million change in annual income before income tax 
natural gas prices are generally influenced by national and regional supply and demand  which is often dependent upon the weather 
specific gas prices are also based on the location of production  pipeline capacity  gathering charges and the energy content of the gas 
throughout most of  gas prices were relatively weak  primarily because of unseasonably warm weather 
gas prices began to increase in fourth quarter when low storage levels and colder than expected weather began to escalate prices 
during  us gas consumption reached record highs  and prices were at their highest level since while domestic demand continues to grow  gas prices in will largely depend on the severity of winter weather  gas storage levels and price competition from other energy sources 
based on production  the company estimates that a per mcf increase or decrease in the average gas sales price would result in approximately a million change in annual income before income tax 
results of operations compared to earnings available to common stock for were million as compared to a net loss of million for significantly improved earnings are the result of higher oil and gas prices and increased gas production from the and acquisitions and development programs 
additionally  results included a million  pre tax  non cash impairment charge recorded upon adoption of sfas results for and included the effects of stock incentive compensation of million and million  respectively

oil revenue increased million or primarily because of a increase in oil prices from an average of in to in see general product prices above 
the company s average oil price was above the average wti price of because of improved oil marketing margins 
oil production declined from to primarily because of property sales and natural decline  largely offset by the effects of the and acquisitions and development programs 
gas revenue increased million or because of a price increase see general product prices above combined with a increase in production 
increased gas production was attributable to the and acquisitions and development programs 
gas gathering  processing and marketing revenues increased million primarily because of revenues from the gas processing plant and gathering facility acquired as part of the santa fe acquisition on august  other revenues decreased million primarily because of net gains on sale of property and equity securities in expenses for totaled million as compared with total expenses of million 
expenses for included the million impairment charge recorded upon adoption of sfas no 
in october all expenses other than impairment increased in primarily because of the and acquisitions 
production expenses increased million or 
per boe  production expense decreased from to 
this decrease is primarily because the and acquisitions were predominantly gas producing properties that generally have lower production costs per boe 
taxes on production and property increased or million because of increased oil and gas revenues 
taxes on production and property per boe only increased from to because of property tax reductions on properties acquired before that largely offset property taxes related to the and acquisitions 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a increased million  or  primarily because of the and acquisitions and development programs 
on a boe basis  dd a decreased from in to in decreased dd a per boe is the result of increased proved reserve estimates at january   reduced depletable costs resulting from the sfas provision recorded in fourth quarter  and the sale and operating leaseback of the tyrone gas processing plant and related gathering system 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  because of company growth and increased stock incentive compensation 
excluding stock incentive compensation  general and administrative expense per boe was in as compared to in gas gathering and processing expense increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily because of rental expense related to the tyrone plant and gathering system lease that began in march this increase offsets related decreases in dd a and interest

oil production increased from as a result of the acquisitions  partially offset by reduced production from natural decline and property sales 
gas revenue increased million or because of a increase in production  attributable to the acquisitions and the and development programs 
the effects of increased production were largely offset by a decline in average gas prices 
part of the decline in the company s average gas price is because of a lower energy content and higher transportation differential for production from the hugoton field 
additionally  the average price was supported by sales of  mcf per day under contract at per mcf during the last six months of the year 
gas gathering  processing and marketing revenues increased million primarily because of revenues from the gas processing plant and gathering facility acquired as part of the santa fe acquisition on august  other revenues increased million because of net gains of million from property sales and a gain of million from sale of equity securities 
expenses for totaled million  a million or increase from total expenses of million 
included in expenses is the million impairment charge recorded upon adoption of sfas no 
in october other expense increases were generally attributable to the acquisitions 
production expenses increased million or 
per boe  production expense decreased from to 
this decrease is generally because the acquisitions were predominantly gas producing properties and therefore have lower production costs per boe 
taxes on production and property increased only or  increased taxes from the acquisitions were almost completely offset by decreased property taxes on properties acquired before  resulting in a decrease in taxes on production and property per boe from to 
dd a increased million  or  primarily because of the acquisitions  the largest of which closed on august on a boe basis  dd a decreased from in to in general and administrative expense increased million  or  primarily because of increased stock incentive compensation of million 
excluding stock incentive compensation  general and administrative expense per boe was in or below in gas gathering and processing expense increased by  or from to this increase was primarily because of operating expenses related to the tyrone gas processing and gathering facility acquired august  interest expense increased million or because of increased debt to partially fund the acquisitions and an increase in interest rates 
weighted average principal outstanding during was million at an average interest rate of compared with weighted average principal of million at for interest expense per boe was in and in liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities  public offerings of equity and debt  and bank debt 
the company s cash requirements  other than for operations  are generally for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties  and debt and dividend payments 
the company believes that its sources of liquidity are adequate to fund its cash requirements during cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in and million in the fluctuation from to was primarily because of increased oil and gas prices and gas production  partially offset by stock incentive compensation payments that increased million  while the fluctuation from to was almost entirely due to timing of realization of accounts receivable  inventory and payables 
before changes in working capital  cash flow from operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the january  and acquisitions were primarily financed by proceeds from long term debt borrowings 
the acquisitions were also partially funded by proceeds from public offerings of common stock 
development expenditures and dividend payments have generally been funded by cash flow from operations 
financial condition total assets increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily because of the acquisitions 
as of december   total capitalization of the company was million  of which was long term debt 
this compares with capitalization of million at december   of which was long term debt 
the increase in the debt to capitalization ratio from year end to is because of increased borrowings under the company s loan agreement to fund the acquisitions and other capital expenditures see financing below 
after considering the effect of the january conversion of subordinated notes  the pro forma debt to capitalization ratio at december  was 
working capital the company generally uses available cash to reduce bank debt and  therefore  does not maintain large cash and cash equivalent balances 
short term liquidity needs are satisfied by bank commitments under the loan agreement see financing below 
because of this  and since the company s principal source of operating cash flows ie  proved reserves to be produced in the following year cannot be reported as working capital  the company often has low or negative working capital 
financing total borrowing commitments from commercial banks under the revolving credit agreement loan agreement were million at december  the loan agreement provides for a revolving facility with scheduled reductions of borrowing commitment that generally occur each june and december as of december   borrowing commitments were scheduled to be reduced to million on december  in connection with a property acquisition in january  borrowing commitments were increased to million  which will be reduced to million on december  borrowings under the loan agreement mature on june   but may be prepaid at any time without penalty 
the company has periodically renegotiated its loan agreement to increase borrowing commitments and extend the revolving facility  however  there is no assurance that the company will continue to do so in the future 
loan capacity under the loan agreement is redetermined annually using present value and cash flow parameters based on year end estimated oil and gas reserves 
if the redetermined loan capacity is less than total borrowings commitments  then such commitments will be reduced by the difference 
if borrowings exceed the redetermined capacity  the company must reduce borrowings to a level equal to the redetermined capacity within a specified period 
during  the company purchased and retired million principal amount of its convertible subordinated notes  resulting in an extraordinary gain of  during  the company redeemed  purchased and retired a total of million principal amount of the notes at a loss of  note purchases were primarily funded by bank borrowings under the loan agreement 
in november and december  principal of million was converted at the option of noteholders into  shares of common stock 
in january  principal of million was converted into  shares of common stock 
as of january   no notes remain outstanding 
in august  the company sold million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million that were used to partially fund the santa fe acquisition 
in september  pursuant to the company s exchange offer  a total of  shares of common stock were exchanged for  shares of series a convertible preferred stock 
on march   the company announced that it intends to offer million of senior subordinated notes due the offering will be made by means of an offering memorandum to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a of the securities act of net proceeds from the sale of notes will be used to reduce bank borrowings under the loan agreement 
capital expenditures in may  the company announced its plan to make strategic acquisitions totaling million over the following months  including additional interests in and around the company s operations  as well as purchases of up to two million shares of the company s common stock 
this goal excludes the previously announced enserch acquisition 
since that date and through december  the company purchased producing properties totaling approximately million excluding the enserch acquisition of million and million treasury shares at a total cost of million 
these purchases were primarily funded by bank debt 
producing property acquisitions include the purchase of of the outstanding beneficial units units of cross timbers royalty trust at a total cost of million 
after the company completed its program to purchase one million units in january  the board of directors authorized the of purchase up to one million additional units 
the company continues to pursue acquisitions that meet its criteria  although there are no assurances that such properties will be available 
the company plans to fund future acquisitions through a combination of cash flow from operations and bank borrowings  proceeds from public equity and debt transactions may also be utilized 
the company s base acquisition budget for is million 
if attractive acquisition opportunities arise during  the company could significantly exceed its base acquisition budget 
in  capitalized expenditures for exploitation and development totaled million  compared to the budget of million 
exploitation and development costs incurred for totaled million 
exploration expenses in totaled  the company has budgeted million for the development program 
as it has done historically  the company expects to fund the development program from cash flow from operations 
since there are no material long term commitments associated with this budget  the company has the flexibility to adjust its actual development expenditures in response to changes in product prices  industry conditions  and the effects of the company s acquisition and development programs 
a portion of the company s existing properties are operated by third parties which control the timing and amount of expenditures required to exploit the company s interests in such properties 
therefore  the company can give no assurances regarding the timing or amount of such expenditures 
to date  the company s expenditures to comply with environmental or safety regulations have not been significant  and the company currently does not expect such expenditures to be significant during however  developments such as new regulations  enforcement policies or claims for damages could result in significant future costs 
in march  the company sold its tyrone gas processing plant and related gathering system for million and entered an agreement to lease the facility from the buyers for an initial term of eight years at annual rentals of million  and with fixed renewal options for an additional years 
in november  the company sold its gathering system in major county  oklahoma for million and entered an agreement to lease the facility from the buyers for an initial term of eight years at annual rental of million and with renewal options for an additional years 
proceeds of these sales were used to reduce borrowings under the loan agreement 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
dividends since the company s inception  the board of directors has declared quarterly dividends of per common share per share on a post split basis 
in february  the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend to per share on a post split basis  or million annually 
continuance of dividends is dependent upon available cash flow  as well as other factors 
in addition  the company s loan agreement restricts the amount of common stock dividends to of operating cash flow for the last four quarters 
cumulative dividends on series a convertible preferred stock are paid quarterly  when declared by the board of directors  based on an annual rate of per share  or million annually 
production imbalances the company has gas production imbalance positions that are the result of partial interest owners selling more or less than their proportionate share of gas on jointly owned wells 
imbalances are generally settled by disproportionate gas sales over the remaining life of the well or by cash payment by the overproduced party to the underproduced party 
the company uses the entitlement method of accounting for natural gas sales 
at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a net receivable of million for a net underproduced balancing position of  mcf of natural gas and  mcf of carbon dioxide 
production imbalances do not have  and are not expected to have  a significant impact on the company s liquidity or operations 
derivatives the company uses derivatives on a limited basis to hedge interest rate and product price risks  as opposed to their use for trading purposes 
to reduce variable interest rate exposure on debt  the company had entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements  the last of which expired september the company had no other significant derivative transactions or balances from to forward looking statements certain statements included in this item  as well as statements included in items and of this report  relating to future development expenditures  strategic acquisitions  proved reserves and other matters of anticipated financial and operating performance constitute forward looking statements
