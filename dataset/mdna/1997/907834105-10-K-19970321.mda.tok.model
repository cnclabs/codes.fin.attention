results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  selected financial data years ended december  millions of dollars total operating revenues   total operating expenses   operating income net income the company reported net income of million for the year ended december   down by million from million in improved operating results were more than offset by the absence of a million after tax gain in from the columbia bankruptcy settlement  the absence of favorable tax adjustments  reduced section tax credits  and increased interest expense and  to a lesser extent  increased general and administrative costs incurred as a result of being a stand alone public company following the offering and related debt restructuring in october on a pro forma basis  after giving effect to transactions occurring at the time of the offering as if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of  net income would have been million above pro forma net income see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating income increased by million over levels as a result of higher product price realizations and volume growth  partially offset by the absence of a million pre tax gain in from the columbia bankruptcy settlement 
demand for hydrocarbons to replenish inventory  the unresolved iraqi situation  capacity problems in mexico and weather related demand provided product price support throughout volume growth has been achieved through drilling  property purchases  plant expansion and ethane recovery 
these gains were offset partially by property writedowns  cost increases associated with expanded exploration activity and increased administrative expenses associated with being a stand alone public company 
oil and gas operations operating revenues operating revenues oil and gas operations years ended december  millions of dollars producing properties  plants  pipelines and marketing other oil and gas revenues producing property revenues increased by million to  million 
production volume increases of mmcfed added million in revenues while higher product prices of mcfe added million in revenues

offsetting these increases were declines in the gulf onshore offshore mmcfd resulting largely from the depletion of several offshore wells  and declines in the rockies mmcfd resulting from production problems 
natural gas liquids ngl volumes from producing properties increased by mbbld to mbbld primarily due to ethane recovery in the rockies and plains canada and additional lease gas being processed in the austin chalk by the expanded brookeland plant 
crude oil volumes were mbbld lower at mbbld as a result of production declines in plains canada and the rockies and the sale of certain non core properties  partially offset by property acquisitions and drilling in the austin chalk 
plants  pipelines and marketing revenues of million increased by million from million in increased plant volumes of mmcfed added million in plant revenues while higher prices of mcfe added million in plant revenues 
pipeline revenue increases of million were primarily attributable to increased throughput and higher prices at the ferguson burleson pipeline in the austin chalk million and ozona pipeline in west texas million 
revenues from the wahsatch pipeline in the rockies were down with lower throughput and tariff rates 
marketing revenues increased by million primarily as a result of improved natural gas and ngl margins  additional marketed volumes and increased natural gas storage activity 
years ended december  average product price realizations plants natural gas per mcf natural gas liquids per bbl average per mcfe sales volumes plants natural gas mmcfd natural gas liquids mbbld total mmcfed ngl volumes increased by mbbld to mbbld primarily due to the expansion of the ozona west texas  brookeland austin chalk and echo springs rockies plants  greater retention percentages at the east texas plant reflecting third parties elections to reject liquids  as well as ethane recovery in other rockies plants 
volume decreases occurred with a contract revision at gulf plains in east south texas  leaner gas streams and lower inlets at giddings plants in the austin chalk and the disposition of certain plants in west texas and the rockies 
natural gas volumes were up mmcfd to mmcfd resulting from the brookeland expansion and increased throughput at gulf plains 
in november  the company received a cash payment from columbia gas transmission company columbia as a part of columbia s emergence from chapter bankruptcy

the austin chalk accounted for mmcfd of the increase 
crude oil volumes declined by mbbld to mbbld 
the austin chalk declined by mbbld to mbbld as a result of more emphasis on the gas prone deep portions of the trend and the natural decline of older properties 
the october sale of point arguello  an offshore california heavy oil field  reduced crude production by another mbbld 
ngl production from producing properties increased by mbbld to mbbld 
all business units showed improvement with the majority of the increase coming from the rockies mbbld 
plants  pipelines and marketing revenues increased by million to million 
increased plant volumes of mmcfed added million in plant revenues  but lower prices reduced revenues by million 
plant revenues also benefitted from a million improvement in other revenues  stemming principally from higher processing and compression fees

pipeline revenues increased by million primarily as a result of the start up and expansion of pipelines in the austin chalk  west texas and the rockies 
years ended december  average product price realizations plants natural gas per mcf natural gas liquids per bbl average per mcfe sales volumes plants natural gas mmcfd natural gas liquids mbbld total mmcfed ngl volumes increased by mbbld to mbbld primarily due to the expansion of the company s two ozona plants in west texas 
natural gas volumes were up by mmcfd to mmcfd primarily because of higher throughput volumes associated with a full year of production at the brookeland plant in the austin chalk 
other oil and gas revenues increased by million in as a result of the columbia settlement million  partially offset by an million loss brought about by weakened correlation for natural gas hedges  lower gains on property sales million  a decrease in recognition of deferred revenue million reflecting lower preferential volumes distributed to an investor in the company s section limited partnership see business section tax credits and the absence of a favorable market sharing settlement million 
operating expenses operating expenses oil and gas operations years ended december  millions of dollars production exploration plants  pipelines and marketing depreciation  depletion and amortization production expenses decreased by million to million  largely because of lower production taxes million reflecting the successful resolution of a production tax audit  lower product prices and tax exemptions related to high cost gas wells 
production expenses excluding production taxes decreased on a per unit basis from mcfe to mcfe in as the sale of several properties with relatively high operating costs reduced lease costs by million 
exploration expenses decreased by million to million  primarily due to a decrease in dry hole costs million associated with a reduction in exploratory drilling 
expenditures for seismic data were million higher than in operating expenses for plants  pipelines and marketing were up by million to million principally due to expenses from the start up and expansion of additional gas value chain assets  partially offset by lower gas plant expenses

income taxes income taxes decreased by million in because of lower income before taxes  primarily reflecting the difference between the gain on the sale of the wilmington field million in and the gain on the columbia settlement million in and favorable tax adjustments totaling million 
the effective tax rate for  excluding such favorable tax adjustments  would have been including million of section tax credits compared with for including million of section tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations for was million  up by million from the increase principally relates to increases in producing property revenues net of production costs  improvements in cash margins from plants  pipelines and marketing  higher distributed equity income primarily from black butte coal company black butte and favorable changes in working capital 
these increases were partially offset by the absence of the columbia bankruptcy settlement  increased payments for interest and income taxes and  to a lesser extent  increased general and administrative costs associated with being a stand alone public company 
the company expects to increase its oil and gas sales volumes in while growing its reserves 
sales volume growth is anticipated primarily in the gulf onshore offshore  austin chalk and west texas 
the company expects to remain one of the most active drillers in the united states in based on the number of active drilling rigs  and will continue to search for properties and reserves which will supplement its drill site inventory 
in addition  third party pipeline expansions which will increase gas transportation capacity from wyoming by approximately mmcfd should be in service in this new capacity should enable rockies gas to be shipped to higher price markets in the future 
the company owns a nonoperating interest in black butte  a partnership which operates a surface coal mine complex in southwestern wyoming 
during  black butte s sales to its largest customer under an amended coal supply contract accounted for million  or  of the company s consolidated operating income 
operating income from this amended contract is expected to be relatively constant through the end of  when the financially beneficial terms of this agreement will terminate 
although black butte continues to seek new buyers for its low sulfur coal  its mining costs are considerably higher than the mining costs for competing supplies 
the company does not expect to be able to replace the operating income it receives currently under the amended contract with incremental coal sales 
capital spending for of million was up by million compared to million for the company s ability to maintain and improve its operating income and cash flow is dependent  among other things  upon continued capital spending 
a summary of capital expenditures for compared to is as follows years ended december  millions of dollars producing properties production exploration property acquisitions total producing properties plants  pipelines and marketing minerals and other total producing property capital spending was up by million as a result of higher lease acquisition costs of million primarily in the austin chalk million  east south texas million and north and south dakota million  and increased exploratory and development drilling million 
drilling accounted for million of capital expenditures  with million in the austin chalk 
property acquisitions totaling million were completed in compared to million in the company expects to increase its level of capital spending in to over billion 
spending is expected to focus on exploration and development activities in the austin chalk business unit  drilling in the gulf onshore offshore and exploration and development in east south texas as well as gas value chain assets 
the company plans to complete construction of the masters creek gas plant to facilitate development of the louisiana extension of the austin chalk  expand the patrick draw plant in the rockies from mmcfd of capacity to mmcfd and add a fifth gas processing plant at its east texas plant complex 
the company s capital spending programs may be adjusted as business and operating conditions change 
in addition  as a result of continued increase in the worldwide demand for soda ash  the company  along with its partner oriental chemical industries  inc  plans to expand the oci wyoming lp soda ash facility by  tons per year  from the plant s current nameplate capacity of million tons per year  by the company s share of expansion costs is expected to be funded primarily with partnership debt 
the company restructured its debt portfolio in  refinancing its indebtedness to upc with a combination of long term fixed rate notes and debentures and short term commercial paper 
as of december  and  the total capitalization of the company was as follows as of december  millions of dollars short term debt note payable to union pacific corporation advances to union pacific corporation total short term debt long term debt bank credit agreement commercial paper  net notes due debentures due debentures due tax exempt revenue bonds discount on notes and debentures total long term debt shareholders equity   total capitalization   debt to total capitalization in october  the company issued million of notes due and million of debentures due in november  the company issued million of debentures due proceeds were used  together with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper  to repay the company s note payable to upc and for general corporate purposes 
none of the company s notes and debentures are redeemable prior to maturity and none are subject to any sinking fund requirements 
in addition  the company has filed a form s registration statement with the securities and exchange commission which would permit the company to offer up to million in debt and equity securities upon the effectiveness of such registration statement 
the company has a million revolving credit agreement that expires in august borrowings under the agreement  at the company s election  bear interest either at a spread over london interbank offered rate libor or at a spread over domestic certificate of deposit rates  in each case depending on the company s senior debt rating 
the company is required to pay facility fees on the aggregate amount of the commitment ranging from 
to 
also depending on the company s senior debt rating 
the agreement contains covenants which limit the ratio of debt to the sum of debt and shareholders equity of the company to and which require the combined ebitdax the sum of operating income  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and exploration expenses of the company s principal operating subsidiaries as defined in the agreement to be at least of the company s consolidated ebitdax 
the agreement also imposes certain restrictions on the company regarding the creation of liens  incurrence of indebtedness  transactions with affiliates  sales of the stock of uprc and certain mergers  consolidations and asset sales 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility although borrowing capacity is reduced by outstanding commercial paper 
the company had the capacity to borrow million under such credit facility as of december excluding commercial paper  the company has no debt maturing in the next five years 
outstanding commercial paper has been classified as long term debt reflecting the company s intent to maintain these short term borrowings on a long term basis either through the continued issuance of commercial paper and or through new long term financings  or by using its currently available long term credit facility if alternative financing is not available 
the company paid cash dividends of million in  which represents a per share quarterly cash dividend on its outstanding shares of common stock 
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  to be declared and paid by the company will depend upon  among other things  the company s financial condition  funds from operations  the level of its capital and exploratory expenditures  future business prospects and other facts deemed relevant by the board of directors 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that dividends will be paid 
the company has no current plans to increase its dividend rate 
the company believes that  following the refinancing of its debt  cash from operations and additional available financing will enable it to fund its capital expenditures  dividends and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
other matters price risk management the company is principally a natural gas company  as natural gas and natural gas liquids made up of the company s production in natural gas and  to a lesser degree  crude oil and natural gas liquids prices are influenced by seasonal factors  natural gas transportation and storage infrastructure  imports  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy  and have been volatile over the last three years 
final prices for prompt month natural gas contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex for delivery of gas at henry hub  louisiana  during the period from january  to december   have ranged from mcf to mcf 
cash prices received by the company in its specific producing areas have exhibited similar volatility during this same period 
changes in sales prices received for production directly affect the company s determination to proceed with the exploration for and development of natural gas and crude oil and the quantity of proved reserves 
its revenues  profitability and cash flow are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for its hydrocarbon product 
based upon the results of operations for the year ended december   and excluding the effect of the company s hedging program  a change of mcf in the average price of natural gas  a change of bbl in the average price of natural gas liquids and a change of bbl in the average price of crude oil throughout such period would have resulted in approximate changes in net income of million  million and million  respectively 
the company uses hydrocarbon based derivative financial instruments from time to time to reduce risks associated with hydrocarbon price volatility 
while the use of these hedging arrangements may limit the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future gains from favorable movements 
hedging generally is accomplished pursuant to exchange traded futures contracts or master swap agreements based on standard forms 
hedging gains and losses are deferred and recognized at delivery of the commodity 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and does not hedge any significant amount of production beyond a month time frame 
the company also enters into long term fixed price sales agreements for physical deliveries of natural gas 
such long term commitments are not reflected in the company s consolidated statements of financial position 
the company had certain financial and fixed price sales contracts in place at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the total unrecognized mark to market present value gain related to such contracts at december  was million  consisting of a million net gain on contracts for physical delivery and a million net gain on financial contracts 
unrecognized mark to market gains or losses were determined based upon current market value  as quoted by recognized dealers  assuming a round lot transaction and using a mid market convention without regard to market liquidity 
in connection with its futures contract hedging activity  the company is required to deposit monies with nymex  representing cash requirements for contract margins and deposits for unrealized losses on open contracts 
such deposits are included in other current assets in the company s consolidated statements of financial position 
at december   the company had margin requirements totaling million  which had been met with cash deposits of million and unrealized gains on open contracts of million 
as a result of its hedging program  the company s oil and gas revenues can be higher or lower than revenues that would be reported if hedging did not occur 
during and  revenues were million and million higher  respectively  while during  revenues were million lower as a result of hedging activities 
environmental costs the company generates and disposes of hazardous and nonhazardous waste in its current and former operations  and is subject to increasingly stringent federal  state and local environmental regulations 
the company has identified sites currently subject to environmental response actions or on the superfund national priorities list or state superfund lists  at which it is or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements 
certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of various sites  consequently  the company s ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to other parties in addition to costs relating to its own activities at each site 
in addition  the company is or may be liable for certain environmental remediation matters involving existing or former facilities 
as of december   long and short term liabilities totaling million had been accrued for future costs of all sites where the company s obligation is probable and where such costs reasonably can be estimated  however  the ultimate cost could be lower or as much as higher 
this accrual includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites  as well as for ongoing monitoring costs  but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties 
the accrual also includes million for the obligation to participate in the remediation of the wilmington field properties 
cost estimates were based on information available for each site  financial viability of other potentially responsible parties prps and existing technology  laws and regulations 
the company believes that it has accrued adequately for its share of costs at sites subject to joint and several liability 
the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine with certainty because of the number of prps involved  site specific cost sharing arrangements with other prps  the degree of contamination by various wastes  the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites and the speculative nature of remediation costs 
the company also is involved in reducing emissions  spills and migration of hazardous materials 
remediation of identified sites and control and prevention of environmental exposures required spending of million in and million in in  the company anticipates spending a total of million for remediation  control and prevention  including million relating to the wilmington properties 
the majority of the december  accrued environmental liability is expected to be paid out over the next five years  funded by cash generated from operations 
based on current rules and regulations  management does not expect future environmental obligations to have a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of the company
