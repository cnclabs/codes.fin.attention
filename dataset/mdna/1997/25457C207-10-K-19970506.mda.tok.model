item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and liquidity the company has incurred consolidated net losses of   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively  and cumulative net losses of  through december  as of december   the company s current assets exceeded its current liabilities by  for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was  net cash used in operating activities for was less than the company s total net loss primarily due to non cash expenses including common stock and options issued for services of  common stock issued subject to forfeiture of  and amortization and depreciation of  in addition  as more fully described in note b  the company recorded a non cash interest charge associated with certain financing activities of  and  as described in note f  recorded a non cash unusual charge of  related to the settlement of certain litigation 
cash was also used for certain investing activities including capital expenditures of  and the purchase of software technologies of  these uses of cash were primarily financed through sales of convertible debentures  common stock and exercises of stock options approximating  net of commissions 
management s plan to continue as a going concern although the company s liquidity position at december   was adversely affected by the company s continuing losses  the equity placements during the year then ended have enabled the company to continue operating 
the company does not maintain a credit facility with any financial institution 
management s plans to remain a going concern  as more fully described below  require additional financing 
the financing is anticipated to be in the form of equity and convertible debenture investments  however there can be no assurances that the company will be able to obtain sufficient financing to execute its plan 
as a result of the continuing operating losses  and the lack of sufficient funds to execute its business plan  there is substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
no adjustments have been made with respect to the consolidated financial statements to record the results of the ultimate outcome of this uncertainty 
management s plans to remain a going concern rely upon achieving positive cash flows from operations through the continued growth of softworks and the successful exploitation of the company s dbexpress technology 
the company s primary source of revenue continues to be derived from its softworks subsidiary 
while to date  revenues from dbexpress have been insignificant  management believes that its proprietary software technology has significant potential in several areas  and solves certain significant business issues in the telecommunications and internet related markets 
in order to realize the potential of this product  management will need to aggressively pursue all marketing opportunities 
to date  the company has incurred significant losses both cash expenses and non cash expenses as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as a result of the development and marketing of dbexpress 
the company continues to pursue license and development agreements with various companies 
while none of the company s existing agreements or development opportunities provide sales commitments  management believes that the successful exploitation of its dbexpress technology will eventually enable the company to achieve positive cash flows from operations 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in achieving positive cash flows from operations with respect to the dbexpress product 
unless the company determines to discontinue its pursuit of dbexpress revenues which requires significant financial resources  the company will need to generate positive cash flows from operations from the sale of dbexpress product in order to decrease its dependency on cash flows from financing activities and remain a going concern 
growth of the company s softworks subsidiary is anticipated to continue for its existing product line  as well as from its new year and multi platform products  and the company anticipates that during the first half of  softworks will release it s first multi platform systems management products with a suite of products under the name centerstage mp which are being developed to resolve storage issues regardless of platform  and to expand softworks market beyond the mainframe segment 
the company believes softworks products are positioned to meet the market demand for systems management software 
the software products being developed for the year simplify the year conversion process by providing tools to help with the critical processes of identifying  diagnosing and simulating millennium issues throughout the mainframe environment 
management believes this product line will result in additional cash flows which will help to defray the company s consolidated costs of operations  however  there can be no assurances as to the volume of revenues which will be generated from this product line 
management believes that the successful exploitation of the company s dbexpress technology  the continuing success of the softworks subsidiary s existing product line and the launching of softworks year and multi platform technologies  among other things  should enable the company to eventually achieve positive cash flows from operations 
the long term success of the company  under its existing business plan  is dependent upon the continuing successful domestic and international growth of softworks  and the company s ability to generate material dbexpress revenues 
due to the recent success and rapid growth of the company s softworks subsidiary  management no longer believes that the company s future success is solely dependent upon the successful exploitation of the dbexpress technology 
entry into the year and multi platform markets through its softworks subsidiary and into the internet market with the company s new java based internet access technology  also opens additional markets for potential future sales 
softworks sells perpetual and fixed term licenses for its mainframe products  for which extended payment terms of three to five years may be offered 
in the case of extended payment term agreements  the customer is contractually bound to equal annual fixed payments 
the first year of post contract support pcs is bundled with standard license agreements 
in the case of extended payment term agreements  the customer may purchase pcs annually 
thereafter  in both instances  the customer may purchase pcs annually 
revenues with respect to such extended payment terms are deferred and recognized over the period of the installment payment plan 
at december   the amount of such future receivables extending beyond one year was  and is included in installment accounts receivable  due after one year and deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
further  the company is attempting to sell maplinx 
should the company not be successful in its efforts to sell maplinx  the company plans to effect substantial cost reductions by consolidating operations 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or over the prior years total of  this increase was primarily due to the increase in softworks revenues of  and dbexpress revenues of  offset by reductions in net revenues of maplinx of  and discontinued subsidiaries of  cost of revenues and technical support  of  represents a decrease of  from the prior year s amount of  due principally to reduced costs incurred by maplinx of  and by the discontinuation of superbase and ccel operations of  offset by increases related to dbexpress of  during  sales and marketing expenses for the company increased  to  from  for the year ended december  the increase was due  in part  to softworks efforts in establishing overseas operations of  the remaining portion of the increase was attributable to dbexpress 
general and administrative expenses decreased  to  for the year ending december  versus  for the year ending december  the decrease was principally due to discontinued subsidiaries of  reductions by maplinx of  offset by increases at softworks of  and costs associated with dbexpress of  research and development costs increased  in to  over the prior years amount of  due principally to refinements in dbexpress technology 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of unusual charges incurred for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the reduction in carrying value of long lived assets of  in  pertains to the write down of maplinx intangible assets 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or over the prior years total of  this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of maplinx  which had net revenues of  as well as an increase in softworks revenues of  offset by the loss of non recurring revenues generated by the product distribution agreements related to dbexpress of  in  and reductions in net revenues of  and  from superbase and ccel  respectively 
cost of revenues and technical support  of  represents an increase of  over the prior years amount of  due principally to the maplinx acquisition which incurred  and increases at softworks and ccel of  and  respectively  offset by decreases from dbexpress and superbase of  and  respectively 
during  sales and marketing expenses for the company increased  to  from  for the year ended december  the acquisition of maplinx accounted for approximately  of such increase 
other material components include an increase at softworks of  which was due  in part  to softworks efforts to bring the dbopen products to market  as well as establishing overseas operations 
general and administrative expenses increased  to  for the year ending december  versus  for the year ending december  a major effort put forth by management of the company to reduce corporate spending resulted in a reduction of  over the prior year 
this was  however  offset by the acquisition of maplinx  which was acquired effective december   and incurred expenses amounting to  during the year 
research and development costs increased  in to  over the prior years amount of  due principally to dbopen and refinements in dbexpress technology 
the charge to operations of  for the reduction in carrying values of long lived assets includes the write down of the software asset held for sale of  and the write off of the dbopen acquisition of approximately  both of which are described in note acquisitions of notes to the consolidated financial statements
