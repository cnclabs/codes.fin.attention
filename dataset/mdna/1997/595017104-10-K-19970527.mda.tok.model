item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring cost write off of in process technology amortization of negative goodwill operating income net sales microchip s net sales of million in fiscal increased by million  or  over fiscal and net sales of million in fiscal increased by million  or  over fiscal the company experienced growth in sales of bit microcontrollers and eeprom memories over these periods and a moderate decline in sales of its commodity memory and other product categories 
the company s family of bit microcontrollers represents the largest component of microchip s total net sales 
microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for  and of total net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
a related component of the company s product sales consist of serial and parallel eeprom memories and high speed and low voltage eproms 
these products accounted for  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the remaining component of total net sales was the company s lower margin memory and other miscellaneous products which accounted for  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
during the three year period ended march  the company increased the percentage of net sales attributable to bit microcontrollers as a result of the company s focus in this area 
it is anticipated that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future 
the company s net sales in any given quarter are dependent upon a combination of orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter turns orders and shipments from backlog 
the company has emphasized its ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of its competitive strategy 
this strategy  combined with current industry conditions  is resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules 
this has had the effect of increasing turns orders as a portion of the company s business in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and has reduced the company s visibility in projecting net sales levels 
because turns orders are more difficult to predict  there can be no assurance that the combination of turns orders and backlog in any quarter will be sufficient to achieve growth in net sales 
if the company does not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter  the company s revenues and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
in the quarter ended march   the company was unable to ship approximately million of product for which it had firm scheduled orders 
this shipment delinquency was a result of inventory mix issues which were exacerbated by the rapid growth in the company s product offerings and the low long term order visibility 
it is anticipated that low long term order visibility will continue for the foreseeable future and  as a result  the company expects it may have shipment delinquencies at the end of each quarter which could adversely affect quarterly operating results 
the company s overall average selling prices for its microcontroller products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of its non volatile memory products have declined gradually over time 
during fiscal  the company experienced increased pricing pressure on its non volatile memory products due primarily to a worldwide industry inventory correction and the less proprietary nature of these products 
there can be no assurance that average selling prices for the company s microcontroller or other products will not experience increased pricing pressure in the future 
an increase in pricing pressure could adversely affect the company s operating results 
the foregoing statements regarding product mix  turns orders  shipment delinquencies and pricing pressures are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbors created thereby 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter  inventory mix and timing of customer orders  competition and competitive pressures on pricing and product availability  customers inventory levels  order patterns and seasonality  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by the company s products  market acceptance of the products of both the company and its customers  demand for the company s products  fluctuations in production yields  production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization  changes in product mix  and absorption of fixed costs  labor and other fixed manufacturing costs 
foreign sales represented  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s foreign sales have been predominantly in asia  europe and japan which the company attributes to the manufacturing strength in those areas for consumer  automotive  office automation  communications and industrial products 
the majority of foreign sales are us dollar denominated 
the company has entered into and  from time to time  will enter into hedging transactions in order to minimize exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
although none of the countries in which the company conducts significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years  there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where the company conducts operations will not adversely affect the company s operating results in the future 
additional factors affecting operating results the company believes that future growth in net sales of its bit family of microcontroller products and related memory products will depend largely upon the company s success in having its current and new products designed into high volume customer applications 
design wins typically precede the company s volume shipment of products for such applications by months or more 
the company also believes that shipment levels of its proprietary application development systems are an indicator of potential future design wins and microcontroller sales 
the company continued to achieve a high volume of design wins and shipped increased numbers of application development systems in fiscal compared to previous fiscal years 
there can be no assurance that any particular development system shipment will result in a product design win or that any particular design win will result in future product sales 
the company s operating results are affected by a wide variety of other factors that could adversely impact its net sales and profitability  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include the company s ability to design and introduce new products on a timely basis  market acceptance of products of both the company and its customers  customer order patterns and seasonality  changes in product mix  whether the company s customers buy from a distributor or directly from the company  product performance and reliability  product obsolescence  the amount of any product returns  availability and utilization of manufacturing capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yield  the availability and cost of raw materials  equipment and other supplies  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by the company s products  technological changes  competition and competitive pressures on prices  and economic  political or other conditions in the united states  and other worldwide markets served by the company 
the company believes its ability to continue to increase its manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand and maintain satisfactory delivery schedules will be an important competitive factor 
as a result of the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to expanding its manufacturing capacity  the company s operating results may be adversely affected if net sales do not increase sufficiently to offset the increased costs 
the company s products are incorporated into a wide variety of consumer  automotive  office automation  communications and industrial products 
a slowdown in demand for products which utilize the company s products as a result of economic or other conditions in the worldwide markets served by the company could adversely affect the company s operating results 
gross profit the company s gross profit was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
gross profit as a percent of sales was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that its cost of sales will fluctuate over time  driven primarily by the product mix of bit microcontroller products and related memory products  manufacturing yields  wafer fab loading levels and competitive and economic conditions 
gross profit percentage was down from the prior years levels  primarily as a result of reduced inch wafer production at one of the company s wafer fabrication facilities and increased pricing pressure on its non volatile memory products 
the company anticipates that its gross profit percentage will fluctuate over time  driven primarily by product mix  manufacturing costs and yields  and competitive and economic conditions 
the company is continuing the process of transitioning products to smaller geometries and to larger wafer sizes to reduce future manufacturing costs 
eight inch wafer production commenced at the tempe wafer fabrication facility in early fiscal the company will continue the transition of products to its micron process 
the foregoing statements relating to anticipated gross margins  cost of sales  and the transition to higher yielding manufacturing processes are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbors created thereby 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others fluctuations in production yields  production efficiencie and overall capacity utilization  cost and availability of raw materials  absorption of fixed costs  labor and other direct manufacturing costs  the timing and success of manufacturing process transition  changes in product mix  competitive pressures on prices  and other economic conditions in the united states and other worldwide markets 
the company has consistently presented its results of operations for all periods on the last in first out lifo method and has assessed the net realizable value of inventory based on lifo costs 
lifo has the effect of matching current costs of production with sales generated during the same period 
production costs have decreased over time due to improvements in manufacturing productivity and yields  resulting in lower cost of sales for the year ended march  due to changes in sales and product mix which affected production costs  cost of sales increased during the years ended march  and the difference in cost of sales between the lifo and fifo inventory valuation methods for the reporting periods was immaterial 
all of microchip s assembly operations and a portion of its product final test requirements are performed by third party contractors in order to meet product shipment requirements 
reliance on third parties involves some reduction in the company s level of control over these portions of its business 
while the company reviews the quality  delivery and cost performance of these third party contractors  there can be no assurance that reliance on third party contractors will not adversely impact results in future reporting periods if any third party contractor is unable to maintain assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 
the company owns product final test facilities in kaohsiung  taiwan  republic of china and chachoengsao  thailand 
the company also uses various third party contractors in thailand  taiwan  the philippines and other locations in asia for product assembly and test 
the company s reliance on facilities in these countries  and maintenance of substantially all of its finished goods inventory overseas  entails certain political and economic risks  including political instability and expropriation  labor disruption  supply disruption  currency controls and exchange fluctuations  as well as changes in tax laws  tariff and freight rates 
microchip currently employs the alphatec electronics public company limited group of companies alphatec headquartered in bangkok  thailand for a significant portion of its product assembly volume and a portion of its product final test capacity 
while alphatec s assembly and test operations have performed reliably for the company for several years  alphatec has recently experienced difficulty in obtaining financing in connection with some of its unrelated joint ventures involving semiconductor fabrication facilities in thailand 
such financing difficulties have not impacted alphatec s assembly and test facilities nor its provision of services to the company 
however  there can be no assurance that assembly and test operations will not be affected in the future 
microchip currently has second sources for product assembly and test for most of its package types and can shift its wafer output to other factories  if necessary  however  that can be no assurance that such action would not result in short term disruption including possible temporary product shortages 
the company has not experienced any significant interruptions in its foreign business operations to date 
nonetheless  the company s business and operating results could be adversely affected if foreign operations or international air transportation were disrupted 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company commenced construction of an additional  square foot wafer fabrication module at tempe  arizona 
it is anticipated that the construction will be completed during the second quarter of fiscal and that the new wafer fabrication module will begin inch wafer production in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the company is also expanding capacity at its chandler wafer fabrication facility and expects to have an additional  square feet of capacity available in chandler during the second quarter of fiscal the foregoing statements regarding completion of construction and additional available capacity are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbors created thereby 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others delays in facilitation of the expanded tempe and chandler wafer fabrication facilities  production yields and efficiencies  factory absorption rates  capacity loading  supply disruption  operating cost levels  and the rate of revenue growth 
research and development the company is committed to continued investment in new and enhanced products  including its development systems software and in its design and manufacturing process technology  which are significant factors in maintaining the company s competitive position 
the dollar investment in research and development increased in fiscal over fiscal  and in fiscal over fiscal the company will continue to invest in research and development in the future  including an investment in process and product development associated with the capacity expansion of the company s fabrication facilities 
the company s future operating results will depend to a significant extent on its ability to continue to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis which can compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements 
the success of new product introductions depends on various factors  including proper new product selection  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  development of support tools and collateral literature that make complex new products easy for engineers to understand and use and market acceptance of customers end products 
because of the complexity of its products  the company has experienced delays from time to time in completing development of new products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any new products will receive or maintain substantial market acceptance 
if the company were unable to design  develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis  its future operating results would be adversely affected 
the company s future success will also depend upon its ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies 
semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change  requiring large expenditures for research and development 
other companies in the industry have experienced difficulty in effecting transitions to smaller geometry processes and to larger wafers and  consequently  have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries 
the company believes that its transition to smaller geometries and to larger wafers will be important for the company to remain competitive  and operating results could be adversely affected if the transition is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 
selling  general and administrative through expense controls and operating efficiencies  the company has reduced selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal to of sales  as compared to and of sales in fiscal and  respectively 
this has been achieved while the company has continued to invest significantly in incremental worldwide sales and technical support resources to promote the company s embedded control products 
however  there can be no assurance that revenue growth in the future will be sufficient to continue to reduce the current level of selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
other income expense interest expense in fiscal increased over fiscal and fiscal due to increased borrowings associated with the company s capital equipment additions and stock repurchase program 
interest income in fiscal decreased from fiscal but increased from fiscal  primarily as a result of changes in invested cash balances 
other income represents numerous immaterial non operating items 
the company s interest expense could increase in fiscal if the company increases its borrowings and interest expense would be adversely impacted by increased interest rates 
provision for income taxes provisions for income taxes reflect tax on foreign earnings and federal and state tax on us earnings 
the company had an effective tax rate of  and for the years ended march   and  respectively  due primarily to lower tax rates at its foreign locations 
the company believes that its tax rate for the foreseeable future will be approximately 
during fiscal  the internal revenue service irs completed an examination of the company s federal income tax returns for fiscal   and as a result of the completion of this examination by the irs and completion of examinations by certain foreign tax authorities  the company recognized a benefit to its effective tax rate in fiscal the foregoing statement regarding the company s anticipated future tax rate is a forward looking statement within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and is subject to the safe harbors created thereby 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others taxation rates in geographic regions where the company has significant operations  and current tax holidays available in foreign locations 
liquidity and capital resources the company had million in cash and cash equivalents at march   an increase of million from the march  balance 
the company has an unsecured line of credit with a syndicate of domestic banks totaling million 
there were no borrowings under the domestic line of credit as of march  the domestic line of credit requires the company to achieve certain financial ratios and operating results 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at march  the company also has an unsecured short term line of credit totaling million with certain foreign banks 
there were no borrowings under the foreign line of credit as of march  there are no covenants related to the foreign line of credit 
at march   an aggregate of million of these facilities was available  subject to financial covenants and ratios with which the company was in compliance 
the company s ability to fully utilize these facilities is dependent on the company remaining in compliance with such covenants and ratios 
during the year ended march   the company generated million of cash from operating activities  an improvement of million from the year ended march  and an improvement of million from the year ended march  the improvement in cash flow from operations was primarily due to increased profitability  the impact of changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses and an increase in depreciation expense 
the company s level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions 
capital expenditures in the years ended march   and were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment in each of these periods 
the company also acquired equipment under capital leases of million in the year ended march  the company currently intends to spend approximately million during the next months for additional capital equipment to increase capacity at its existing wafer fabrication facilities  to construct additional facilities and to expand product test operations 
the company expects capital expenditures will be financed by cash flow from operations  available debt arrangements and other sources of financing 
the company believes that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next months will provide sufficient additional manufacturing capacity to meet its currently anticipated needs 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended march   and respectively 
proceeds from sale of stock and put options were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
proceeds from issuance of long term debt were million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
proceeds from lines of credit were million for the year ended march  repayments on lines of credit were million for the year ended march  cash expended for the purchase of the company s common stock was million for the year ended march  on july   the company s board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan which permits the company to purchase up to  shares of its common stock and to sell up to  put options 
based on the price of microchip s stock and other pertinent factors  the company may from time to time purchase shares on the open market or sell put options 
see footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements  below 
the company believes that its existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  the semiconductor industry is capital intensive 
in order to remain competitive  the company must continue to make significant investments in capital equipment  for both production and research and development 
the company may seek additional equity or debt financing during the next months for the capital expenditures required to maintain or expand the company s wafer fabrication and product test facilities 
the timing and amount of any such capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including demand for the company s products  product mix  changes in industry conditions and competitive factors 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  and any additional equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing investors
