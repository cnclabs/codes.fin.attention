item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations bellwether is an independent energy company primarily engaged in the acquisition  exploitation  development and exploration of oil and gas properties 
the company has grown and diversified its operations through the acquisition of oil and gas properties and the subsequent development of these properties 
the company s results of operations have been significantly affected by its success in acquiring oil and gas properties and its ability to maintain or increase production through its exploitation activities 
fluctuations in oil and gas prices have also significantly affected the company s results 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method of accounting  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
oil and gas properties in the pool  plus estimated future expenditures to develop proved reserves and future abandonment  site reclamation and dismantlement costs  are depleted and charged to operations using the unit of production method based on the ratio of current production to total proved recoverable oil and gas reserves 
to the extent that such capitalized costs net of depreciation  depletion and amortization exceed the discounted future net revenues on an after tax basis of estimated proved oil and gas reserves  such excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  the writedown of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase 
sharp declines in oil and gas prices may cause companies who report on the full cost method  such as bellwether  to write down their oil and gas properties  thereby decreasing earnings during such period 
the company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage oil and gas price risk 
settlements of gains and losses on price swap contracts are generally based upon the difference between the contract price and the average closing nymex or other floating index price and are reported as a component of oil and gas revenue 
gains or losses attributable to the termination of swap contracts are deferred and recognized in revenue when the hedged oil and gas is sold

outlook the company has adopted a million capital budget for fiscal  primarily for development and exploratory drilling activities 
the company believes its working capital and net cash flows provided by operating activities are sufficient to meet these capital commitments 
the company is reviewing several acquisitions  any one of which could materially exceed the planned capital expenditure levels 
it is anticipated that such acquisitions  if consummated  would be funded through additional borrowings and or the issuance of securities 
bellwether exploration company and subsidiaries the company s results of operations and cash flow are affected by changing oil and gas prices 
increases in oil and gas prices often result in increased drilling activity  which in turn increases the demand for and cost of exploration and development 
thus  increased prices may generate increased revenue without necessarily increasing profitablity 
these industry market conditions have been far more significant determinants of company earnings than have macroeconomic factors such as inflation  which has had only minimal impact on company activities in recent years 
while it is impossible to predict the precise effect of changing prices and inflation on future company operations  the short lived nature of the company s gas reserves makes it more possible to match development costs with predictable revenue streams than would long lived reserves 
no assurance can be given as to the company s future success at reducing the impact of price changes on the company s operating results
