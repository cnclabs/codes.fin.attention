item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management strategy the company is pursuing a strategy that is designed to improve its performance by positioning the bank as a locally managed full service community bank in an increasingly competitive environment 
although mortgage lending is expected to continue as an important part of the company s business  a key component of the company s strategy is the provision of nonbanking financial services and products  such as annuity and insurance products and brokerage services through invest to retain and attract customers 
in addition  the third party loan originator network enables the company to be a competitive  low cost provider of single and multi family mortgage loans 
the nonbanking financial services and products are also intended to generate additional fee income and thereby improve profitability 
the company also intends to diversify its asset base and at the same time develop further customer relationships through increased consumer lending activities  such as home equity lending 
finally  the company will continue to pursue opportunities for growth and expansion in the bank s existing marketplace  whether through acquisitions  such as the bank s acquisition of deposits from the rtc in  or through additional facilities  such as the schaumburg and harlem avenue offices  opened in fiscal the company may seek additional asset growth to further leverage its net worth 
in the event that its traditional retail sources of funding and investment opportunities ie  deposits and direct lending are insufficient for this purpose  or appear to be inappropriately priced  the bank may further utilize the wholesale markets  such as fhlb advances  for funding or mortgage backed securities for investment opportunities 
year compliance the company utilizes and is dependent upon data processing systems and software to conduct its business 
the data processing systems and software include those developed and maintained by the company s third party data processing vendor and purchased software which is run on in house computer networks 
in the company initiated a review and assessment of all hardware and software to confirm that it will function properly in the year to date  those vendors which have been contacted have indicated that their hardware or software is or will be year compliant in time frames that meet regulatory requirements 
the costs associated with the compliance efforts are not expected to have a significant impact on the company s ongoing results of operations 
asset liability management the company s overall asset liability strategy is directed toward managing the bank s exposure to interest rate risk in changing interest rate environments 
asset liability management is a daily function of the bank s management due to continual fluctuations in interest rates and financial markets 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a special time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
at september   total interest bearing liabilities maturing  repricing  or estimated to prepay within one year exceeded total interest earning assets maturing  repricing  or estimated to mature or reprice  in the same period by million  representing a cumulative one year negative gap of of assets 
thus  during future periods of rising interest rates  the costs on interest bearing liabilities may increase more quickly than the yields on interest earning assets  which could adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  in a period of falling interest rates  the yields on its interest earning assets may decrease at a slower pace than the cost of its interest bearing liabilities 
the company closely monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies 
management s interest rate sensitivity strategy is designed to provide a relatively stable stream of net interest income in moderately varying interest rate environments 
the following table sets forth the scheduled repricing or maturity of the company s assets and liabilities at september   based on certain assumptions used by the ots with respect to passbook  now and checking account withdrawals 
the company s loan prepayment assumptions are based on national experience data 
these assumptions may not be indicative of the actual prepayments and withdrawals experienced by the company 
the effect of these assumptions is to quantify the dollar amount of items that are interest sensitive and may be repriced within each of the periods specified 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest yield because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other pressures beyond the company s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes

federal regulations require the bank to classify loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities  considered by the ots to be of lesser quality  as substandard  doubtful or loss assets 
the bank s classification policies provide that assets will be classified according to ots regulations 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated special mention by management 
when the bank determines that an asset should be classified  it generally does not establish a specific allowance for such asset unless it determines that such asset may result in a loss 
the bank may  however  increase its general valuation allowance in an amount deemed prudent 
general valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
the bank s policies provide for the establishment of a specific allowance equal to of each asset classified as loss or to charge off such amount 
a savings institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the ots which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
the bank reviews the problem loans in its portfolio on a monthly basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations  and believes its classification policies are consistent with ots policies 
as of september   the bank had classified assets of million 
classified loans of million were categorized as substandard  consisting of residential mortgage loans  commercial loan  and unsecured lines of credit 
in addition to the mortgage and consumer portfolio  the bank classified its investment in commercial leases as substandard 
there were no assets classified as doubtful 
from october through january  the bank purchased full payout commercial equipment leases located in various parts of the country with original aggregate outstanding principal balances of million 
since that time normal lease payments had reduced the aggregate outstanding balance to million at february  these leases were all originated by  serviced by  and financially guaranteed by bennett funding group of syracuse  new york bfg 
on march  it was reported that bfg was the target of a civil complaint filed by the securities and exchange commission 
on that same date bfg filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the northern district of new york and halted payments on the lease agreements 
the bankruptcy trustee is currently collecting the lease payments from the lessees and holding them in escrow pending the outcome of the litigation concerning bfg  its creditors  and related issues 
this disruption of payment flows from the servicer  bfg  has caused the company to classify all the leases as substandard  place them on non accrual status and to categorize them as non performing and impaired 
in august  the bank and the bennett bankruptcy trustee reached a settlement agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  the bank received post bankruptcy lease receipts totaling million 
repayment of the balance of  in lease receivables at september  is expected from future lease payments 
the settlement also ended all outstanding litigation 
as a result of the settlement  the company charged off  of leases in  against the previously established allowance 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan and lease losses based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in its loan portfolio and the general economy 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans on which full collection may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance 
in recent years  in light of the general economic conditions  management has  from time to time  increased its provision to account for its evaluation of the potential effects of such conditions 
the bank will continue to monitor and modify its allowances for loan losses as conditions dictate 
although the bank maintains its allowance at a level which it considers adequate to provide for potential losses  there can be no assurances that such losses will not exceed the estimated amounts 
the following table sets forth the bank s allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated

for internal purposes  the bank does not allocate the allowance among loan classifications 
in the following table  the allowance for loan losses has been allocated by category for purposes of complying with public disclosure requirements 
the amount allocated on the following table to any category should not be interpreted as an indication of future charge offs and the amounts allocated are not intended to reflect the amount that may be available for future losses on any category since the bank s allowance is a general allowance

the company is the holder of certain subordinated notes the notes issued by cole taylor financial group  inc the notes have a par value and cost basis of million 
the notes were acquired by the company in  when cole taylor financial group  inc was the parent company for both a consumer finance company and a chicago area 
earlier this year  cole taylor s bank subsidiary was spun off to certain cole taylor shareholders in exchange for stock and certain assets 
the notes remained as obligations of the surviving company  which is now known as reliance acceptance group  inc racc and is the parent company for the consumer finance company 
on november   racc filed a form q with the sec in which racc reported  among other things  substantial additions to its loan loss reserves  increasing delinquencies and repossession losses  a severe decline in its net interest margin  continuing defaults under senior credit agreements  a lack of future funding sources  and the imposition of substantial restrictions by senior lenders 
in addition  racc reported that it is seeking a buyer and that bankruptcy may become necessary under certain circumstances 
duff phelps credit rating co 
thereafter downgraded its rating on racc s subordinated notes to ccc triple c 
the company has evaluated currently available information about racc s present circumstances and future prospects in an effort to assess impairment and to place a value on the notes in the context of a possible racc liquidation  sale and or bankruptcy 
the company concluded that the impairment is other than temporary  and that a complete write down of the notes was appropriate  because of racc s worsening condition  the fact that the notes are subordinate to the senior debt and are structurally subordinate to the other obligations of racc s finance company subsidiary  and the substantial uncertainties that exist regarding ultimate realization of the asset 
accordingly  the company wrote the notes down million during the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended september  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the write down was charged against fiscal year earnings because the notes were considered to be temporarily impaired 
the company intends to closely monitor future developments concerning racc  and to continue to explore alternatives for realizing a recovery on this investment

recent regulatory developments pending legislation 
legislation is pending in the congress that would eliminate the federal thrift charter by requiring each federal thrift to convert to a national bank or to a state bank or state thrift 
under the pending legislation  any federal thrift that failed to convert to a national or state bank within two years following enactment of the legislation would  by operation of law  become a national bank as of the second anniversary of enactment of the legislation 
the bills would allow a converting federal thrift and its holding company to retain nonconforming investments and activities following conversion subject to certain conditions  including  in the case of a holding company  certain restrictions on the ability of the holding company to acquire other depository institutions or to be acquired 
the pending legislation would combine the ots with the office of the comptroller of the currency by the second anniversary of the enactment of the legislation  and would merge the bank insurance fund the bif and the savings bank insurance fund the saif as of the earlier of january  or the second anniversary of enactment of the legislation 
the pending legislation would also allow bank holding companies to engage in a wider range of nonbanking activities  including greater authority to engage in securities and insurance activities 
at this time  the company is unable to predict whether the pending legislation will be enacted and  therefore  is unable to predict the impact the pending legislation will have on the company and the bank

as a savings and loan holding company  the company is registered with  and is subject to regulation by  the ots under the home owners loan act  as amended the hola 
under the hola  the company is subject to periodic examination by the ots and is required to file with the ots periodic reports of its operations and such additional information as the ots may require 
investments and activities 
the hola prohibits a savings and loan holding company  directly or indirectly  or through one or more subsidiaries from i acquiring control of  or acquiring by merger or purchase of assets  another savings association or savings and loan holding company without the prior written approval of the ots  ii subject to certain exceptions  acquiring more than of the issued and outstanding shares of voting stock of a savings association or savings and loan holding company except as part of an acquisition of control approved by the ots  or iii acquiring or retaining control of a financial institution that does not have saif or bif insurance of accounts 
a savings and loan holding company may acquire savings associations located in more than one state in both supervisory transactions involving failing savings associations and nonsupervisory acquisitions of healthy institutions  subject to the requirement that in any nonsupervisory transaction  the law of the state in which the savings bank to be acquired is located must specifically authorize the proposed acquisition  by language to that effect and not merely by implication 
state laws vary in the extent to which interstate acquisitions of savings associations are permitted 
illinois law presently permits savings and loan holding companies located in any state of the united states to acquire savings associations or savings and loan holding companies located in illinois  subject to certain conditions  including the requirement that the laws of the state in which the acquiror is located permit savings and loan holding companies located in illinois to acquire savings associations or savings and loan holding companies in the acquiror s state 
a savings and loan holding company that controls only one savings association subsidiary is generally not subject to any restrictions on the non banking activities that the holding company may conduct either directly or through a non banking subsidiary  so long as the holding company s savings association subsidiary constitutes a qualified thrift lender 
if  however  the ots determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the continuation by a savings and loan holding company of a particular activity constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of its savings association subsidiary  the ots may require the holding company to cease engaging in the activity or divest any subsidiary which engages in the activity or may impose such restrictions on the holding company and the subsidiary savings association as the ots deems necessary to address the risk  including imposing limitations on i the payment of dividends by the savings association to the holding company  ii transactions between the savings association and its affiliates and iii any activities of the savings association that might create a serious risk that liabilities of the holding company and its affiliates may be imposed on the savings association 
federal legislation also prohibits acquisition of control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company  such as the company  without prior notice to the ots 
control is defined in certain cases as acquisition of of the outstanding shares of a savings association or savings and loan holding company 
dividends 
the statutes and regulations administered by the ots do not generally regulate the payment of dividends by savings and loan holding companies 
the ots  however  possesses enforcement powers over savings and loan holding companies to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations 
among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by savings and loan holding companies 
further  federal law and ots regulations do impose limits on the amount of dividends that a savings association may pay to its holding company see the bank dividends which can indirectly limit the payment of dividends by a savings and loan holding company if dividends from the holding company s savings association subsidiary represent a significant source of funds for dividends from the holding company to its stockholders 
in addition to the restrictions on dividends that may be imposed by the ots  the delaware general corporation law allows the company to pay dividends only out of its surplus  or if the company has no surplus  out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and or the preceding fiscal year

the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank system  which provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions 
deposit insurance 
as an fdic insured institution  the bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the fdic 
the fdic has adopted a risk based assessment system under which all insured depository institutions are placed into one of nine categories and assessed insurance premiums based upon their respective levels of capital and results of supervisory evaluations 
institutions classified as well capitalized as defined by the fdic and considered healthy pay the lowest premium while institutions that are less than adequately capitalized as defined by the fdic and considered of substantial supervisory concern pay the highest premium 
risk classification of all insured institutions is made by the fdic for each semi annual assessment period 
during the period october  through december   saif assessments rates ranged from of deposits to of deposits 
for the period january  through december   saif assessment rates ranged from of deposits to of deposits 
the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the fdic determines  after a hearing  that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  order  or any condition imposed in writing by  or written agreement with  the fdic 
the fdic may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for a permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital 
management of the company is not aware of any activity or condition that could result in termination of the deposit insurance of the bank 
fico assessments 
since  a portion of the deposit insurance assessments paid by saif members has been used to cover interest payments due on the outstanding obligations of the financing corporation fico  the entity created to finance the recapitalization of the federal savings and loan association corporation  the saif s predecessor insurance fund 
pursuant to federal legislation enacted september   commencing january   both saif members and bif members will be subject to assessments to cover the interest payment on outstanding fico obligations 
such fico assessments will be in addition to amounts assessed by the fdic for deposit insurance 
until january   the fico assessments made against bif members may not exceed of the amount of the fico assessments made against saif members 
currently  saif members pay fico assessments at a rate equal to approximately of deposits while bif members pay fico assessments at a rate equal to approximately of deposits 
between january  and the maturity of the outstanding fico obligations in  bif members and saif members will share the cost of the interest on the fico bonds on a pro rata basis 
it is estimated that fico assessments during this period will be less than of deposits 
ots assessments 
federal savings associations are required to pay supervisory fees to the ots to fund the operations of the ots 
the amount of such supervisory fees is based upon each institution s total assets  including consolidated subsidiaries  as reported to the ots 
during the year ended september   the bank paid supervisory fees to the ots totaling capital requirements 
the ots has established the following minimum capital standards for savings associations  such as the bank a core capital requirement  consisting of a minimum ratio of core capital to total assets of  a tangible capital requirement consisting of a minimum ratio of tangible capital to total assets of  and a risk based capital requirement  consisting of a minimum ratio of total capital to total risk weighted assets of  at least one half of which must consist of core capital 
for purposes of these capital standards  core capital consists primarily of permanent stockholders equity less intangible assets other than certain supervisory goodwill  certain mortgage servicing rights and certain purchased credit card relationships and less investments in subsidiaries engaged in activities not permitted for national banks  tangible capital is substantially the same as core capital except that all intangible assets other than certain mortgage servicing rights must be deducted  and total capital means core capital plus certain debt and equity instruments that do not qualify as core capital and a portion of the bank s allowances for loan and leases losses 
the capital requirements described above are minimum requirements 
higher capital levels will be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual institutions 
for example  the regulations of the ots provide that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of interest rate risk or the risks posed by concentrations of credit or nontraditional activities 
additionally  the ots has proposed to amend its capital regulations to provide that the minimum core capital requirement of applies only to the most highly rated savings associations  and all other savings associations must maintain a minimum ratio of core capital to total assets of 
during the year ended september   the bank was not required by the ots to increase its capital to an amount in excess of the minimum regulatory requirement 
as of september   the bank exceeded its minimum regulatory capital requirements with core capital ratio of  a tangible capital ratio of and a risk based capital ratio of 
federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions 
the extent of the regulators powers depends on whether the institution in question is well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned  the regulators corrective powers include requiring the submission of a capital restoration plan  placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities  requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock including additional voting stock or to be acquired  restricting transactions with affiliates  restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits  ordering a new election of directors of the institution  requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed  prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks  requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries  prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt  and ultimately  appointing a receiver for the institution 
dividends 
ots regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by savings associations  including cash dividends 
the rule establishes three tiers of institutions 
an institution that exceeds all fully phased in capital requirements before and after the proposed capital distribution a tier institution could  after prior notice to  but without the approval of  the ots  make capital distributions during a calendar year of up to the higher of i of its net income to date during the calendar year plus the amount that would reduce by one half its surplus capital ratio ie  the excess capital over its fully phased in capital requirements at the beginning of the calendar year  or ii of its net income over the most recent preceding four quarter period 
any additional capital distributions by a tier institution would require prior regulatory approval 
as of september   the bank was a tier institution 
the payment of dividends by any financial institution or its holding company is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations  and a financial institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if  following payment thereof  the institution would be undercapitalized 
as described above  the bank exceeded its minimum capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of september  further  under applicable regulations of the ots  the bank may not pay dividends in an amount that would reduce its capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with the bank s conversion from the mutual to the stock form of ownership in notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends  however  the ots may prohibit the payment of any dividends by the bank if the ots determines such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice

safety and soundness standards 
the ots has adopted guidelines which establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of savings associations 
the guidelines set forth standards for internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits  asset quality and earnings 
in general  the guidelines prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area  and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals 
if an institution fails to comply with any of the standards set forth in the guidelines  the ots may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance 
the preamble to the guidelines states that the ots expects to require a compliance plan from an institution whose failure to meet one or more of the guidelines is of such severity that it could threaten the safety and soundness of the institution 
failure to submit an acceptable plan  or failure to comply with a plan that has been accepted by the ots  would constitute grounds for further enforcement action 
branching authority 
federally chartered savings associations which qualify as domestic building and loan associations  as defined in the internal revenue code  or meet the qtl test see the bank qualified thrift lender test have the authority  subject to receipt of ots approval  to establish branch offices anywhere in the united states  either de novo or through acquisitions of all or part of another financial institution 
if a federal savings association fails to qualify as a domestic building and loan association  as defined in the internal revenue code  or fails to meet the qualified thrift lender test  the association generally may establish a branch in a state other than the state of its home office only to the extent authorized by the law of the state in which the branch is to be located

the term portfolio assets is statutorily defined to mean a savings association s total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets  the association s business property and a limited amount of its liquid assets 
as of september   the bank satisfied with the qtl test  with a ratio of qualified thrift investments to portfolio assets of and qualified as a domestic building and loan association  as defined in the internal revenue code 
liquidity requirements 
during the year ended september   ots regulations required the bank to maintain  for each calendar month  an average daily balance of liquid assets including cash  certain time deposits  bankers acceptances  and specified united states government  state or federal agency obligations equal to at least of the average daily balance of its liquidity base  defined as net withdrawable accounts plus short term borrowings ie  those repayable in months or less during the preceding calendar month 
during the year ended september   ots regulations also required the bank to maintain  for each calendar month  an average daily balance of short term liquid assets generally liquid assets having maturities of months or less equal to at least of the average daily balance of its net withdrawable accounts plus short term borrowings during the preceding calendar month 
penalties may be imposed for failure to meet liquidity ratio requirements 
at september   the bank was in compliance with ots liquidity requirements  with an overall liquidity ratio of and a short term liquidity ratio of 
pursuant to amendments adopted by the ots effective november   the minimum liquidity requirement has been reduced to of the liquidity base  the short term liquidity requirement has been eliminated  liquidity requirements will be determined quarterly  rather than monthly  and savings associations have the option of calculating their liquidity requirements either on the basis of i their liquidity base at the end of the preceding quarter or ii the average daily balance of their liquidity base during the preceding quarter 
the amended regulations also provide  however  that savings associations must maintain liquidity in excess of the minimum requirement if necessary to insure safe and sound operations 
federal reserve system 
federal reserve board regulations  as presently in effect  require depository institutions to maintain non interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts primarily now and regular checking accounts  as follows for transaction accounts aggregating million or less  the reserve requirement is of total transaction accounts  and for transaction accounts aggregating in excess of million  the reserve requirement is million plus of the aggregate amount of total transaction accounts in excess of million 
the first million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements 
these reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the federal reserve board 
the bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements 
the balances used to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the federal reserve board may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the ots 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services

no other new accounting policies were adopted and the application of existing policies was not changed during fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the ots requires all regulated thrift institutions to calculate the estimated change in the bank s net portfolio value npv assuming instantaneous  parallel shifts in the treasury yield curve of to basis point either up or down in basis point increments 
the npv is defined as the present value of expected cash flows from existing assets less the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of net expected cash inflows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
the ots provides all institutions that file a schedule entitled the consolidated maturity rate schedule cmr as a part of their quarterly thrift financial report with an interest rate sensitivity report of npv 
the ots simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option based pricing approach to measuring the interest rate sensitivity of npv 
the ots model estimates the economics value of each type of asset  liability  and off balance sheet contact under the assumption that the treasury yield curve shifts instantaneous and parallel up and down to basis points in basis point increments 
the ots allows thrifts under million in total assets to use the results of their interest rate sensitivity model  which is based on information provided by the bank  to estimate the sensitivity of npv 
since the bank had less than million in total assets at september   the results discussed this section were provided by the ots analysis 
the ots model utilizes an option based pricing approach to estimate the sensitivity of mortgage loans 
the most significant embedded option in these types of assets is the prepayment option of the borrowers 
the ots model uses various price indications and prepayment assumptions to estimate sensitivity of mortgage loans 
in the ots model the value of deposit accounts appears on the asset and liability side of the npv analysis 
in estimating the value of certificates of deposit account  the liability portion of the cd is represented by the implied value when comparing the difference between the cd face rate and available wholesale cd rates 
on the asset side of the npv calculation  the value of the customer relationship due to the rollover of retail cd deposits represents an intangible asset in the npv calculation 
other deposit accounts such as transaction accounts  money market deposit accounts  passbook accounts  and non interest bearing accounts also are included on the asset and liability side of the npv calculation in the ots model 
the accounts are valued at of the respective account balances on the liability side 
on the assets side of the analysis  the value of the customer relationship of the various types of deposit accounts is reflected as a deposit intangible 
the npv sensitivity of borrowed funds is estimated by the ots model based on a discounted cash flow approach 
the cash flows are assumed to consist of monthly interest payments with principal paid at maturity 
the ots model is based only on the bank level balance sheet 
the assets and liabilities at the parent company level are short term in nature  primarily cash and equivalents  and were not considered in the analysis because they would not have a material effect on the analysis of npv sensitivity 
the following table sets forth the company s interest rate sensitivity of npv as of september  net portfolio value as a net portfolio value of present value of assets changes in rates amount change change npv ratio change bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp
