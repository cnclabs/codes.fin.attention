item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
much of pmsi s business is based upon proprietary databases  computer technology and product know how  and assets that are generally difficult  time consuming or costly for third parties to duplicate 
the company s strategy is to take advantage of its operating leverage and grow the business by increasing the market penetration of existing products and services  by developing products and services for different national markets  and by creating new information services from data in the pmsi databases or from linking such data with data from third parties to meet the evolving information needs of the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry 
the company s future results will be dependent in part upon management s ability to take advantage of the operating leverage in the pmsi business by increasing revenues from both existing and new services 
revenue revenue for the year ended june  was million  an increase of million over revenue for the year ended june  revenues grew significantly in the united states market research and database businesses  japanese information services and uk market research division 
this growth was partially offset by the revenue reduction of million  due to the divestment of poorly performing database businesses at the end of fiscal and during this year 
currency exchange rate movements when compared to rates  principally in japan and the netherlands  negatively impacted the year s revenue by million  or 
revenue for the year ended june  was million  an increase of million over revenue for the year ended june  revenues demonstrated growth in the united states market research and database businesses  japan  our european scriptrac businesses and from acquisitions completed in fiscal this was offset by a continued decrease in revenue in the united states direct marketing business due to the phasing out of low margin programs and the restructuring of the united kingdom market research businesses 
production costs pmsi s production costs include the costs of data collection  outside supplies and services  internal computer costs and the costs attributable to personnel involved in the production of the company s products and services 
production costs for the year ended june  were million of revenue  compared to million of revenue for the year ended june  the increase in costs was primarily attributable to revenue growth and new product development in japan and europe 
production costs for the year ended june  were million of revenue  compared to million of revenue for the year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth  including from acquisitions completed in late fiscal  and the launch of scriptrac in spain 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million of revenues for the year ended june  as compared to million of revenues for the same period in this was due to a reduction in general and administrative expenses arising from improved cost control in the us and following the divestment of poorly performing database businesses with disproportionately high general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million of revenues for the year ended june  as compared to million of revenues for the same period in the increase was attributable to acquisitions completed in late fiscal  new product development for which no revenue was generated and increases in staff to support additional clients for existing services 
amortization of intangible assets acquired databases  software and other purchased intangibles are valued at their fair value at the date of acquisition and are amortized over periods of up to five years 
goodwill is amortized over periods between and years 
the cost of updating and maintaining databases is expensed as incurred  as is the cost of developing software for internal use 
in the company s consolidated financial statements  amortization has been recorded as follows in thousands databases software goodwill    total    for the year ended june  compared to the same period in  database  software and goodwill amortization decreased due to the effects of the charge for the impairment of long lived assets recorded during fiscal for the year ended june  compared to the same period in  database  software and goodwill amortization increased due to the inclusion for the full year of acquisitions completed in impairment of long lived assets and restructuring costs in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded million write down in the value of long lived assets  primarily goodwill and databases pursuant to the adoption of fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
in addition  the company recorded million of restructuring costs 
these charges to earnings  per share after tax effect  were primarily related to the disposal of two database businesses that did not meet performance expectations 
at june   accrued liabilities and accounts payable included million for restructuring liabilities 
all such liabilities were paid during fiscal interest and other income interest expense pmsi invests its excess cash with major banks  and cash equivalents and marketable securities in a professionally managed fund 
for the year ended june   the company s net interest expense was million as compared to million for the same period in an increased return on the company s investments was offset by an increase in the interest expense  due to the allocation of enterprise interest to discontinued operations for a full year in  but only for part of fiscal for the year ended june   the company s net interest expense was million as compared to interest income just under million for the same period in the preceding year 
the increased cost was primarily attributable to a decrease in funds invested 
income tax provision the tax provisions of million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively  reflect taxes payable in respect of profitable foreign and domestic operations 
at june   there were foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to reduce future foreign income taxes payable 
deferred tax assets recognized by the company result from the anticipated carryback of future tax deductions to offset income taxes previously provided and the utilization of future tax deductions to reduce taxes payable on future taxable income 
the reduction in the deferred tax asset recognized in the balance sheet at june  is due to the utilization of net operating losses in japan and the uk 
a valuation allowance has been made against a significant part of the net operating losses established in the current year  due to the expectation of further statutory tax losses in certain foreign jurisdictions 
discontinued operations following the decision to divest the company s non database segment  a million loss on disposal was recorded during fiscal this  together with the net loss for the period through march  of million were classified as the loss from discontinued operations  net in the statement of operations 
during fiscal  the company recorded a further net charge for the loss on disposal of discontinued operations of million 
this arose from changes to the original estimates of net proceeds and income expected to be generated during the disposal period 
at the end of the measurement period  one business from the discontinued non database segment still remained to be sold and the results of this business subsequent to the measurement period have been included within operating income from continuing operations as income from assets held for sale 
its net assets  together with the remaining accrual for the loss expected to be generated on disposition  are recorded in the balance sheet as net current assets held for sale and net assets held for sale 
it remains management s intention to sell the company s french point of sale business 
currency fluctuations as an international company  pmsi is affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
although most of the company s services are priced in the local currency of the business unit providing the service  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are mitigated by the fact that expenses of foreign subsidiaries are incurred in the same currency as sales 
the reported net income of foreign subsidiaries will be affected by changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies against the united states dollar 
the magnitude of the effects on the company of future exchange rate changes will be dependent upon the relative contributions to the company s results of its united states and non united states operations 
the foreign currency risk applicable to the company s operations has not been hedged 
quarterly results the production costs of the company s pharmaceutical information services which are expensed as incurred have a relatively high fixed direct cost component because of the relatively constant cost of maintaining the databases from which the services are derived 
once these fixed costs are covered  a higher gross margin is achieved on incremental revenues 
the company s overall gross profit margin in any quarter and any improvement in such margin over time will therefore be highly dependent on the relative gross profit margins of the company s various products and services that contribute to revenue in such quarter and the relative revenue growth rates for such products and services 
historically  quarter to quarter comparisons of the company s results of operations have not necessarily been indicative of these trends  principally as a result of i timing of acquisitions and divestments to create the pmsi business  ii revenue reductions resulting from product changes or discontinuations in the post acquisition period  iii cost of investing in the turnaround or profit improvement of certain acquired businesses  iv write downs of asset values and v the investment in new products and services 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million and its current ratio was the current ratio at june  was during the year ended june   cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities increased due to the switch from long term to short term marketable securities and proceeds from the sale of assets relating to the discontinued operations 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures in fiscal will be less than million and will be funded from internally generated funds 
the company anticipates that existing cash  together with internally generated funds  will provide the company with the resources that are needed to satisfy the company s working capital requirements in fiscal and subsequent years 
the timing and magnitude of future acquisitions will continue to be the single most important factor in determining the company s long term capital needs 
the company signed definitive agreements  subsequent to the year end  to acquire the source europe business from source informatics inc source  and to divest its minority interest in the source informatics venture in the united states together with its otc physician survey business 
the working capital injection necessary to fund the source europe business during fiscal and subsequently  will be provided from the proceeds of the sale of the joint operating venture and otc businesses in the us as well as the company s own internally generated funds 
subsequent events on august  the company announced that it had signed definitive agreements to acquire the source europe business and to divest its minority interest in the source informatics venture in the united states together with its otc physician survey business in a three way transaction with national data corporation ndc and source informatics inc source 
under these agreements  pmsi will receive i the source europe business  ii  pmsi common shares held by source  iii million in cash  and iv  registered shares in ndc 
the company will file a proxy statement with the sec  prior to calling a special meeting of pmsi s common stockholders 
subject to receiving the approval of pmsi common stockholders  the company expects the transactions to close before the end of calendar year on july  the company announced that it had finalized the sale of its dutch and us based international publishing and communications operations to excerpta medica  the medical communications division of elsevier science for million  resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately million 
the sale of these businesses formed part of the program of divestitures of non core businesses announced by the company in may year scriptrac for windows client software used for delivering scriptrac has been developed to ensure compliance with the year the us joint operating venture has successfully tested its software to ensure year compliance 
the internal systems within the pmsi local operations are to be reviewed for the impact of the year no significant impact on the company s financials is expected 
recently issued accounting standards in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 earnings per share  which is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after december  the new standard requires changes to computation  presentation and disclosure requirements of primary and fully diluted earnings per share 
the company has reviewed the impact of the new standard on the financial statements and related disclosures and determined that the calculated earnings per share will not be significantly affected
