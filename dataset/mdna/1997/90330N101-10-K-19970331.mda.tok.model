the company believes that its existing capital resources  together with anticipated revenues from operations  will provide the company with sufficient funds to finance its current level of business operations for at least the next months

this planned expansion and development will require substantial financing 
the company currently has no commitments or arrangements for such financing and there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
unlike the agency business which generates an immediate activation commission  the resale of wireless services requires immediate investment in subscriber acquisition costs as well as on going costs generated from the purchase of air time from carriers and for administrative support 
these costs are recoverable from the long term revenue stream created by the continuation of subscribers services 
the company s ability to capture such revenue streams may be adversely affected by service cancellations before subscriber acquisition costs are recovered and by losses caused by the fraudulent use of service which  by law  are not recoverable from subscribers 
inflation to date  inflation has not had any significant impact on the company s business
