page as more fully discussed below  the company and dst completed a public offering of dst common stock and associated transactions in november  which reduced the company s ownership of dst to approximately 
accordingly  the company s investment in dst was accounted for under the equity method for the year ended december  retroactive to january  recent developments concession to operate mexico s northeast railway 
on december   the company and transportacion maritima mexicana  sa de sa tmm  together with their joint venture  tfm  announced that the mexican government government had awarded to tfm the right to purchase of the common stock of ferrocarril del noreste  sa de sa fne for approximately billion mexican pesos approximately billion us fne holds the concession to operate mexico s approximate  mile northeast railway for the next years  with the option of a year extension subject to certain conditions 
the northeast railway is a strategically important rail link to mexico and the north american free trade agreement nafta corridor 
the line is estimated to transport approximately of mexico s rail cargo and is located next to primary north south truck routes 
the northeast railway directly links mexico city and monterrey  as well as guadalajara through trackage rights  with the ports of lazaro cardenas  veracruz  tampico  and the cities of matamoros and nuevo laredo 
nuevo laredo is a primary transportation gateway between mexico and the united states 
the northeast railway will connect in laredo  texas to the union pacific railroad up and the texas mexican railroad company tex mex  a wholly owned subsidiary of mexrail 
the tex mex links to kcsr at beaumont  texas through trackage rights 
with the kcsr and tex mex interchange at beaumont  and through kcsr s connections with major rail carriers at various other points in the united states  kcsr  together with tmm  has developed a nafta rail system which is expected to facilitate the economic integration of the north american marketplace 
tfm deposited approximately million us with the government on january  representing approximately of the purchase price as the initial installment under the agreement to purchase fne 
the company funded its proportionate amount approximately million us of the initial installment as a capital contribution to tfm using borrowings under existing lines of credit 
the government has transferred to tfm of the stock of fne and deposited an additional of the stock in trust pending receipt of the final installment of the purchase price from tfm 
the remaining of fne will be retained by the government 
the government has the option of selling its interest through a public offering  or selling it to tfm subsequent to october  at the share price paid by tfm indexed for inflation at the mexican base rate ie  the unidad de inversiones udi published by banco de mexico 
in the event that tfm does not purchase the government s interest  tmm and kcsi are obligated to purchase the interest in proportion to their ownership interest in tfm 
the remaining of the purchase price will be paid when tfm gains operational control of the northeast railway  but in no case later than july  tfm through fne has entered into a letter of intent with an investment banking institution to finance the majority of this remaining amount through a combination of a senior bank facility  a high yield note offering  and if necessary a high yield bridge loan facility 
together with a line of credit  the arrangements are expected to make available to tfm approximately million 
the terms of the letter of intent include a possible capital call of million from tmm and the company if certain performance benchmarks  to be agreed upon  are not met 
the company would be responsible for approximately million of the capital call 
concurrent with the arrangement of financing for tfm  tmm and the company entered into a letter of intent to sell approximately of tfm to the government for approximately million us the letter of intent contemplates that the government s interest would have limited voting rights  and that tmm and the company would have a call option  which could be exercised at the share price paid by the government plus a us dollar denominated interest factor based on one year us treasury securities 

page the proceeds from the government will be used to finance a portion of the fne purchase price 
upon completion of the transaction  the company s interest in tfm would be reduced from to approximately  and the company would account for its investment in tfm under the equity method 
in the event that the proceeds from the proposed debt financing and sale of of tfm to the government do not provide funds sufficient for tfm to make the final installment of the purchase price  the company may be required to make additional capital contributions 
in order to hedge against a portion of the company s exposure to a strengthening mexican peso  in february and march  the company entered into two separate forward contracts to purchase mexican pesos million to mature in july and million to mature in may any gains or losses associated with these contracts will be deferred until maturity and accounted for as components of the company s investment in tfm 
these contracts are intended to hedge only a portion of the company s exposure related to the final installment of the purchase price and not any other transactions or balances 
additionally  tfm has entered into approximately million in forward contracts to hedge against its exposure to a strengthening mexican peso 
see foreign exchange matters below 
upon completion of tfm s purchase of of fne  the company expects that its investment in tfm will total approximately million 
in addition to the initial contribution to tfm in connection with the acquisition of fne  the company expects that tfm will require substantial funding as it begins its efforts to upgrade the northeast railway s equipment  systems  procedures and marketing capabilities in order to meet the growing needs of mexico s domestic and foreign trade 
the company believes the anticipated financing arrangements discussed above will be sufficient to fund these expected investments 
gateway western purchase 
in december  kcstc a wholly owned subsidiary of the company acquired beneficial ownership of the outstanding stock of gateway western  a regional rail carrier with operations from kansas city  missouri to east st 
louis and springfield  illinois 
gateway western also has restricted haulage rights between springfield and chicago from the southern pacific rail corporation sp 
the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase 
the consideration paid for gateway western including various acquisition costs and liabilities was approximately million  which  based on initial purchase price allocations  exceeded the fair value of the underlying net assets by approximately million 
the resulting intangible will be amortized over a period of years 
the stock acquired by kcstc will be held in an independent voting trust until the company receives approval from the stb on the proposed transaction 
the approval process is expected to take approximately five months 
if approved  the voting trust will be dissolved and the shares transferred to kcstc  however  if the acquisition is not approved  the shares would have to be disposed to a non affiliated third party 
while the gateway western stock is held in trust  the company will account for gateway western under the equity method as a majority owned unconsolidated subsidiary 
if the shares are transferred to kcstc  purchase price allocations will be completed and gateway western will become a consolidated subsidiary reported under the kcsr segment 
under a prior agreement with the atchison  topeka santa fe railway company  burlington northern santa fe corporation has the option of purchasing the assets of gateway western based on a fixed formula in the agreement through the year panama railroad concession 
on july   the panamanian government notified the company and its partner  mi jack products  inc  that they had been awarded the exclusive right to negotiate a definitive agreement for the concession to operate the panama railroad company 
the current route of the panama railroad company runs parallel to the panama canal 
the company is in the process of evaluating the various alternatives available with respect to the concession

page results of operations consolidated operating results during were affected by the following significant developments 
southern capital joint venture 
on october   the company and gatx capital corporation gatx completed the formation and financing of a joint venture to perform certain leasing and financing activities 
the venture  southern capital  was formed through a gatx contribution of million in cash  and a company contribution through its subsidiaries kcsr and carland of million in net assets  comprising a negotiated fair value of locomotives and rolling stock and long term indebtedness owed to kcsi and its subsidiaries 
in an associated transaction  southern leasing corporation an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company prior to dissolution in october  sold to southern capital approximately million of loan portfolio assets and rail equipment 
as a result of these transactions and subsequent repayment by southern capital of indebtedness owed to kcsi and its subsidiaries  the company received cash which exceeded the net book value of its assets by approximately million 
concurrent with the formation of the joint venture  kcsr entered into operating leases with southern capital for the majority of the rail equipment acquired by or contributed to southern capital 
accordingly  this excess fair value over book value is being recognized over the terms of the leases 
the cash received by the company was used to reduce outstanding indebtedness by approximately million  after consideration of applicable income taxes  through repayments on various lines of credit and subsidiary indebtedness 
the company reports its ownership interest in southern capital under the equity method of accounting 
dst s investment in continuum 
on august   the continuum company  inc continuum  formerly an approximate owned dst unconsolidated equity affiliate  merged with computer sciences corporation csc  a publicly traded company in a tax free share exchange 
in exchange for its ownership interest in continuum  dst received approximately million shares representing an approximate interest of csc common stock 
as a result of the transaction  the company s earnings include approximately million after tax  or per share  representing the company s proportionate share of the one time gain recognized by dst in connection with the merger 
continuum ceased to be an equity affiliate of dst  thereby eliminating any future continuum equity affiliate earnings or losses 
dst recognized equity losses in continuum of million for the first six months of and million for the year ended december  dst recognized million in equity earnings from continuum in csc did not pay any dividends in  consistent with historical practice 
railroad industry trends and competition 
during the period from to  the railroad industry has experienced ongoing consolidation 
specifically  burlington northern  inc and santa fe pacific corporation bn sf merged in  as did the up and the chicago and north western transportation company up cnw 
also in  the up announced its intentions to merge with sp  and the stb issued its formal approval of this merger in august up sp 
in march  csx corporation and norfolk southern corporation announced that they would each be purchasing parts of conrail  inc as these transactions are not completed or have only recently been completed  the company cannot predict their ultimate outcome or effect on kcsr 
however  the company believes that kcsr revenues are being negatively affected by increased competition from the bn sf and up cnw consolidations as a result of diversions of rail traffic away from kcsr lines 
when taken together with the up sp merger  management believes that the recent railroad consolidations will negatively impact kcsr revenues by approximately million to million annually given current operating conditions and traffic patterns 
see the first paragraph of overview section of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations page  regarding forward looking comments 
page in addition to competition within the railroad industry  highway carriers compete with kcsr throughout its operating area 
since deregulation of the railroad industry  competition has resulted in extensive downward pressure on freight rates 
truck carriers have eroded the railroad industry s share of total transportation revenues 
however  rail carriers  including kcsr  have placed an emphasis on competing in the intermodal marketplace  working together to provide end to end transportation of products 
mississippi and missouri river barge traffic  among others  also competes with kcsr in the transportation of bulk commodities such as grains  steel  and petroleum products 
see union labor negotiations below for a discussion of the impact of labor issues and regulations on competition in the transportation industry 
stock repurchase program 
the company s board of directors board has authorized management to repurchase a total of eleven million shares of kcsi common stock as market conditions permit 
during  approximately million shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
cumulatively  in excess of million shares had been repurchased under the program as of december  the repurchases were financed through borrowings from existing lines of credit  and proceeds received from issuance of debentures in december and in connection with the november dst public offering and debt repayment to kcsi 
in connection with this program  the company entered into a forward stock purchase contract for the repurchase of shares 
see discussion in financial instruments and purchase commitments below 
berger joint venture 
berger entered into a joint venture agreement with bank of ireland asset management us limited  a subsidiary of bank of ireland  to develop and market a series of international and global mutual funds 
the new venture  named bboi worldwide llc bboi  is headquartered in denver  colorado 
regulatory approvals were received in october  and the first no load mutual fund product the berger biam international fund was introduced in fourth quarter berger accounts for its investment in bboi under the equity method 
union labor negotiations 
approximately of kcsr s employees are covered under various collective bargaining agreements 
in  the company effectively settled labor contract disputes with all major railroad unions  including the united transportation union  the brotherhood of locomotive engineers  the transportation communications international union  the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees  and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
the provisions of the various labor agreements  which extend to december   generally include periodic general wage increases  lump sum payments to workers  and greater work rule flexibility  among other provisions 
settlement of these labor issues effectively mitigates the possibility of a work stoppage and did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
as a result of these labor agreements  which will result in operating efficiencies  management believes the company is better positioned to compete effectively with alternative forms of transportation  as well as other railroads 
however  railroads remain restricted by certain remaining antiquated operating rules and are thus prevented from achieving optimum productivity with existing technology and systems 
kcsr and other railroads continue to be affected by labor regulations which are more burdensome than those governing non rail industries  such as trucking competitors 
the railroad retirement act requires up to a contribution by railroad employers on eligible wages  while the social security and medicare acts only require a employer contribution on similar wage bases 
other programs  such as the federal employees liability act fela  when compared to worker s compensation laws  vividly illustrate the competitive disadvantage placed upon the rail industry by federal labor regulations 
see the first paragraph of overview section of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations page  regarding forward looking comments 
page senior management employment agreements 
on january   the company announced the adoption of a performance based compensation plan for kcsi and kcsr senior management 
senior officers agreed to freeze their salaries for three years effective january   and to forego cash incentive compensation for the same period  in exchange for performance stock options  which provide returns based upon appreciation in the market value of the company s stock 
dst public offering 
on october   dst and the company effected an initial public offering for a total of million shares of dst common stock 
in conjunction with the offering  the company completed an exchange of dst shares for million shares of kcsi common stock held by the employee stock ownership plan esop 
on november   an over allotment option was exercised by the underwriters of the dst common stock offering for an additional million shares of dst common stock held by kcsi  effectively completing the public offering 
the company recorded an after tax gain of approximately million during the fourth quarter of from this transaction  representing per share in fourth quarter and per share for the year ended december  as a result of the offering and associated transactions  the company s ownership in dst decreased to approximately  and the dst investment was accounted for under the equity method retroactive to january  the purpose of the offering was to achieve market recognition of dst s performance as a stand alone entity and to obtain proceeds for the retirement of debt  repurchase of company common stock and general corporate purposes 
the net proceeds to the company from the offering and repayment of indebtedness by dst totaled approximately million  after applicable income taxes 
mexrail investment 
in november  the company purchased of the common stock of mexrail from tmm 
mexrail owns of the tex mex  as well as certain other assets 
the tex mex operates a mile rail line extending from corpus christi to laredo  texas 
the purchase price of million was financed through existing lines of credit 
upon completion of purchase price allocations in  approximately million of intangibles were recorded as the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the underlying net assets 
the intangible amounts are being amortized over a period of years 
the investment is being accounted for under the equity method 
as a result of efforts by the company in connection with the up sp merger  the stb  as a condition for approval of the merger  granted the tex mex trackage rights to operate over up lines between corpus christi and beaumont  texas 
in beaumont  the tex mex interchanges with kcsr  effectively extending the kcsr rail network to the mexican border  where it connects with the northeast railway 
as noted earlier  this interchange  together with kcsr s connections with major rail carriers at various other points in the united states and the company s partial ownership of the northeast railway through its equity investment  tfm  positions kcsr to be an integral component of the economic integration of the north american marketplace 
new kcsr management 
in may  the company s board of directors elected michael r 
haverty to the offices of president and chief executive officer of kcsr  and executive vice president of kcsi 
he was also appointed a director of kcsi 
with more than years of railroad experience  the addition of mr 
haverty demonstrates the company s renewed focus on its railroad operations 
the company also filled several other important kcsr senior management positions  bringing numerous years of relevant industry experience to the organization 
kcsr unusual costs 
during the first and second quarters of  kcsr recorded approximately million after tax  or approximately per share  of unusual costs and expenses related to employee separations and other personnel related activities  unusual system operational related expenses  and reserves for contracts  leases and property 

page debt securities registration and offerings 
the us securities and exchange commission declared the company s registration statement on form s file no 
 originally filed on september  effective april   registering million in securities 
however  no securities have been issued 
the securities may be offered in the form of common stock  new series preferred stock par value  convertible debt securities  or other debt securities collectively  the securities 
net proceeds from the sale of the securities would be added to the general funds of the company and used principally for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures  and acquisitions of or investments in businesses and assets 
on december   the company issued million of debentures due the debentures are redeemable at the option of the company at any time  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to the greater of a of the principal amount of such debentures or b the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate as defined in the debentures agreement plus basis points  and in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption 
the net proceeds of this transaction were used to repay indebtedness on the company s existing lines of credit and for acquisition of kcsi common stock 
kcsi credit agreements 
on may   the company established a credit agreement in the amount of million 
the credit agreement replaced approximately million of then existing company credit agreements which had been in place for varying periods since proceeds of the facility have been and are anticipated to be used for general corporate purposes 
the agreement contains a facility fee ranging from 
per annum  interest rates below prime and terms ranging from one to five years 
the company also has various other lines of credit totaling million 
these additional lines  which are available for general corporate purposes  have interest rates below prime and terms of less than one year 
at december   the company had million outstanding under its various lines of credit 
as discussed earlier  the company funded its proportionate amount approximately million of the initial fne purchase price payment made by tfm to the mexican government using borrowings under its lines of credit 
kcsr equipment trust certificates 
in late  kcsr completed the private placement of financing for locomotives and rolling stock using equipment trust certificates etc s 
the etc s were placed for an aggregate of million representing locomotives  boxcars and covered hoppers  which had been placed in service during and the financing represents of equipment value  bears interest at a rate of and matures in berger acquisition 
in october  the company acquired a controlling interest in berger 
berger is the investment advisor to the berger one hundred fund  the berger growth and income fund formerly the berger one hundred and one fund  the berger small company growth fund and the berger new generation fund  as well as to private and other accounts 
in  the company made payments of million in cash  pursuant to a stock purchase agreement the agreement 
the agreement also provides for additional purchase price payments totaling approximately million  contingent upon berger attaining certain levels up to billion of assets under management  as defined in the agreement  over a five year period 
any additional payments made under the contingency clause of the agreement will be reflected as an adjustment to the purchase price 
the acquisition  which was accounted for as a purchase  increased the company s ownership in berger from approximately acquired in to over 
adjustments to appropriate asset and liability balances were recorded based upon estimated fair values of such assets and liabilities 
the transaction resulted in the recording of intangibles as the purchase price exceeded the fair value of underlying tangible assets 
in and  contingent payments were made totaling and million  respectively  resulting in adjustment to the purchase price 
the intangible amounts are being amortized over their estimated economic life of years 

page the financial statements of berger were consolidated into the company effective with the closing of the transaction 
assuming the transaction had been completed on january   the addition of berger s revenues and net income including adjustments to reflect the effects of the acquisition on a pro forma basis as of and for the year ended december   would not have had a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations 
in january  berger purchased for treasury the common stock of a minority shareholder 
this transaction increased the company s ownership in berger to approximately  and resulted in approximately million of intangibles  which will be amortized over their estimated economic life of years 
termination of janus compensation arrangements berger minority stock transaction 
in fourth quarter  the company recorded certain one time charges to earnings from its financial asset management businesses 
these one time items were a result of the early termination of employment and earnings related compensation arrangements for certain janus key employees  and the establishment of additional minority stock ownership of berger for key berger employees 
the janus compensation arrangements  which began in  permitted individuals to earn units which vested over time based upon janus earnings 
these arrangements were scheduled to be fully vested at the end of and would have continued to accrue benefits in subsequent years 
the company negotiated the early termination of the arrangements  resulting in payments by janus of million in cash  of which approximately million had been accrued 
termination of the arrangements resulted in a net reduction in janus contribution to kcsi s consolidated earnings of million or per share 
by terminating this program  janus operating expenses were approximately million lower than what they would have been if the compensation arrangements were still in effect 
future years should continue to benefit from this transaction through savings in compensation expense that would have been incurred if these arrangements were still in effect 
the berger stock transaction established minority stock ownership for certain key berger employees and resulted in a one time pretax increase in berger s operating expenses of million 
the additional minority stock was intended to provide ownership incentive to these key employees for future growth of berger  and was anticipated in the berger acquisition discussed earlier 
together  these janus and berger transactions reduced kcsi s consolidated earnings by per share 
completion of kcsr track and structure rebuilding program acceleration of midsouth corporation rebuilding program 
during  kcsr concluded the major portions of a rail track and structure program which began in this program was implemented to upgrade the roadway in order to reduce operating costs  improve safety  increase the capabilities of kcsr and increase quality of service to customers 
in addition  as part of the midsouth corporation midsouth acquisition in july  a planned upgrade of the existing midsouth roadbed was added to the program 
increased traffic levels on both the original kcsr route and the midsouth  however  accentuated the need to accelerate the midsouth portion of the program 
by the end of  kcsr had essentially completed the midsouth upgrade program thereby improving the capacity  efficiency and safety of the east west midsouth route 
accordingly  kcsr capital expenditures for were million 
acceleration of the midsouth program and completion of the majority of the kcsr program in resulted in a reduction of railway capital expenditures to million in this roadway rebuilding program was funded with internally generated cash flows 

page midsouth net operating loss carryovers 
in connection with the company s purchase of midsouth  the company acquired operating loss carryovers totaling million  of which million remained at december  with expiration dates beginning in the year 
annual utilization of these loss carryovers may be limited by the internal revenue code as a result of a change in ownership 
anticipated future tax benefits associated with the loss carryovers were recorded as a reduction of recorded intangibles 
safety and quality programs 
kcsr continued the implementation of important safety and quality programs during related benefits are expected to be recurring in nature and realizable over future years 
safety and quality programs comprise two important ongoing elements of kcsr management s goal of reducing employee injuries 
associated program expenses are not anticipated to have a material impact on operating results in future years

page the presentation above presents and with dst as an unconsolidated affiliate versus historical if was restated to a comparable basis ie  dst would be reflected as an unconsolidated affiliate  consolidated revenues and operating income would have been as follows in millions revenues change from prior year operating income change from prior year the kansas city southern railway company the kansas city southern railway company segment includes kcsr  kcsr s wholly owned subsidiary  sgi which owns carland  and equity investments in southern capital and gateway western 
kcsr operates a rail system of  main and branch line route miles and  total track miles in a nine state region  including missouri  kansas  arkansas  oklahoma  mississippi  alabama  tennessee  louisiana  and texas 
kcsr has the shortest rail route between kansas city and the gulf of mexico  serving the ports of beaumont and port arthur  texas  and new orleans  baton rouge  reserve and west lake charles  louisiana 
through haulage rights  kcsr accesses the states of nebraska and iowa  and serves the ports of houston and galveston  texas 
kansas city  missouri  as the second largest rail center in the united states  represents an important interchange gateway for kcsr 
kcsr also has interchange gateways in new orleans and shreveport  louisiana  dallas and beaumont  texas  and jackson and meridian  mississippi 
major commodities moved by kcsr include coal  grain and farm products  petroleum  chemicals  paper and forest products  as well as other general commodities 
kcsr competes in the intermodal traffic market  including an east west line running from dallas  texas to meridian  mississippi  which has allowed kcsr to be more competitive in transcontinental intermodal transportation 
additionally  in november  kcsr began dedicated through train service between dallas  texas and meridian  mississippi for intermodal traffic  which competes directly with truck carriers along the interstate corridor  offering service times which are competitive with both truck and other rail carriers 
in  the kansas city southern railway company segment contributed million to the company s consolidated earnings as compared to million in the increase in over is primarily attributable to the unusual costs and expenses discussed in results of operations above  which reduced kcsr net income by approximately million in exclusive of the unusual costs and expenses  kcsr earnings were lower than  mainly due to reduced revenues and higher operating costs attributable to adverse winter weather in first quarter  train derailment expenses primarily in second quarter  and expenditures associated with kcsr s continuing emphasis on providing improved and reliable customer service 
the following summarizes components of kcsr s revenues in millions general commodities coal intermodal other total 
page kcsr revenues were lower than due to a reduction in general commodities revenues 
in particular  revenues decreased in grain traffic  bulk commodities such as non metallic minerals and petroleum coke  and paper forest products 
these lower general commodities revenues were primarily a result of an decrease in carloading volumes  offset partially by slightly improved revenue per carload average rates 
kcsr revenues were higher in than from increased volumes in general commodities  coal and intermodal 
lower kcsr carloading volumes in were primarily a result of competitive pressures from the various mergers recently completed in the railroad industry 
however  overall revenue per carload average rates were slightly better than largely due to changes in the mix of general commodities traffic eg  fewer carloadings of paper forest products compared to chemical and petroleum products in versus 
as noted earlier  the recent mergers could negatively impact kcsr revenues by approximately million to million annually given current operating conditions and traffic patterns 
in contrast to  rates in the last several years have experienced downward pressures  largely due to competition from over the road truck transportation 
changing regulations  subsidized highway improvement programs and favorable labor regulations have improved the competitive position of trucks as an alternative mode of surface transportation for many commodities 
in recent years  railroad industry management has sought avenues for improving its competitive positions and forged alliances with truck companies in order to provide faster  safer and more efficient service to its customers 
kcsr joined this industry trend and entered into agreements with several truck companies for through train intermodal service between dallas  texas and meridian  mississippi in november as noted above 
in  business volumes benefited from a full year associated with this new intermodal service  resulting in a million increase in revenues over comparable kcsr s intermodal revenues continued this growth trend increasing over  despite a flat intermodal market in general 
in terms of carloadings  coal continues to be the largest single commodity handled by kcsr  generating of total revenue carloadings in kcsr delivers coal to six electric generating plants  located at amsterdam  missouri  flint creek  arkansas  welsh  texas  mossville  louisiana  kansas city  missouri  and pittsburg  kansas 
two coal customers  southwestern electric power company and gulf states utility company  comprised approximately of total coal revenues generated by kcsr in kcsr also delivers lignite to an electric generating plant at monticello  texas tumco 
unit coal revenues were essentially equal to  reflecting historical tendencies of unit coal revenues to equalize on an annual basis 
petroleum and chemicals  serviced via tank and hopper cars primarily to markets in the southeast and northeast through interchange with other rail carriers  as a combined group represents the largest commodity to kcsr in terms of revenue million in versus million in 
the increase in is a result of increased volumes 
further  these carloading volumes and revenues could grow in future years if the stb approves kcsr s petition seeking approval for construction of a nine mile rail line from kcsr s main line into the geismar  louisiana industrial area  which is supported by three major chemical manufacturers 
the geismar area is a large industrial corridor with several companies engaged in the petro chemical industry  and is currently served by only one rail carrier 
however  initial construction will be delayed until the company receives approval from the stb which is still pending

page paper and forest products carloadings decreased versus comparable as a result of business related volume declines 
kcsr  the third largest railroad in terms of pulp and paper carload originations in the us  serves eleven paper mills directly including international paper co 
and georgia pacific  among others and six others indirectly through short line connections  and transports pulpwood  woodchips and raw fiber used in the production of paper  pulp and paperboard 
revenues from grain  farm and food products declined compared to  largely from significantly reduced export grain traffic 
this decline is attributable to traffic diversions resulting from the various rail mergers and the impact of weaker harvest conditions in fall despite the decrease in total kcsr revenues in versus  kcsr operating income increased million as a result of a decrease in costs and expenses to million compared to this decrease is attributable to the unusual costs and expenses 
exclusive of the unusual items  costs and expenses were higher than primarily due to adverse winter weather in first quarter  train derailment expenses  and kcsr s continuing emphasis on providing improved and reliable customer service

consolidated interest expense increased in to million compared to million in this increase was a result of higher average debt balances throughout although ending balances were lower due to repayment of credit lines using the proceeds received from the dst public offering and associated transactions

kcsr is a former owner of part of the land in question 
this matter was the subject of a trial in the us district court in shreveport  louisiana which was concluded in july the court found that joslyn manufacturing company joslyn  an operator of the plant  was and is required to indemnify kcsr for damages arising out of plant operations 
kcsr s potential liability is as a property owner rather than as a generator or transporter of contaminants 
the case was appealed to the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit  which court affirmed the us district court ruling in favor of kcsr 
in early  the environmental protection agency added the lincoln creosoting site to its cercla national priority list 
since major remedial work has been performed at this site by joslyn  and kcsr has been held by the federal district and appeals courts to be entitled to indemnity for such costs  it would appear that kcsr should not incur significant remedial liability 
at this time  it is not possible to evaluate the potential consequences of further remediation at the site 
the louisiana department of transportation ldot has sued kcsr and a number of other defendants in louisiana state court to recover clean up costs incurred by ldot while constructing interstate highway at shreveport  louisiana louisiana department of transportation v

b in the first judicial district court  caddo parish  louisiana 
the clean up was associated with an old oil refinery site  operated by the other named defendants 
kcsr s main line was adjacent to that site  and kcsr was included in the suit because ldot claims that a derailment on the adjacent track released hazardous substances onto the site 
however  because the derailment occurred on the side of the track opposite from the refinery site  management believes the company s exposure is limited 
in another proceeding  louisiana department of environmental quality  docket no 
ie  kcsr was named as a party in the alleged contamination of capitol lake in baton rouge  louisiana 
during  the list of potentially responsible parties was significantly expanded to include the state of louisiana  and the city and parish of baton rouge  among others 
studies commissioned by kcsr indicate that contaminants contained in the lake were not generated by kcsr 
management and counsel do not believe this proceeding will have a material effect on the company 
in the ilada superfund site located in east cape girardeau  ill  kcsr was cited for furnishing one carload of used oil to this petroleum recycling facility 
counsel advises that kcsr s liability  if any  should fall within the de minimus provisions of the superfund law  representing minimal exposure

page inflation 
inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations in the past three years 
generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical costs 
replacement cost and related depreciation expense of the company s property would be substantially higher than the historical costs reported 
any increase in expenses from these fixed costs  coupled with variable cost increases due to significant inflation  would be difficult to recover through price increases given the competitive environments of the company s principal subsidiaries
