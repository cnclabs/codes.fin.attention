item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in item of this report 
general industry the company currently derives substantially all of its revenues from the sale of steel containers manufactured at the company s plants 
the packaging market in which the company competes is generally mature and stable 
on average  domestic industry growth rates have historically followed us gdp growth rates 
management believes that companies that have managed sustained growth in these markets above the gdp level have typically accomplished this growth primarily through acquisitions 
industry consolidation has occurred during recent years 
sales growth the company s net sales have grown at a compounded annual rate of over the past five years  from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal  primarily as a result of acquisitions during this period and  to a lesser extent  market penetration in key existing product segments and new product development 
the acquisitions have strengthened and expanded the company s position in key product and geographic markets and  through consolidation  have enabled the company to achieve operating synergies 
raw materials the largest component of cost of sales is tinplate steel  which is currently supplied by large  national manufacturers 
tinplate prices have historically been negotiated once per year  with changes effective january  and have typically remained stable for the subsequent one year period 
the company is working with other companies to lower the overall cost of its steel purchases 
tinplate consumers typically negotiate late in the year for the next calendar year on terms of volumes and price 
terms agreed to have historically held through the following year  but there is no assurance that this practice will remain unchanged in the future 
steel prices have historically been adjusted as of january of a calendar year 
most domestic tinplate and blackplate steel producers have announced a price increase to become effective january  the company has historically arranged for raw material price increases which are lower than those publicly announced by its suppliers  although there can be no assurances that this practice will continue 
gross profit margins continuous advances in manufacturing productivity and cost reduction have been critical to the industry and the company s ability to improve gross profit margins 
the bsnj acquisition and the bso acquisition late in the third quarter of fiscal  and the mcc acquisition early in the first quarter of fiscal increased the company s sales by approximately 
the sales of the acquired businesses historically provided lower gross margins than those reported by the company 
the company s objective is to improve margins by maximizing synergies through employment of the company s historically successful r strategic initiative to rationalize  reengineer and recapitalize these acquired businesses 
although certain employee termination costs in connection with plant rationalizations  administrative workforce reductions  and other plant exit costs associated with the recent acquisitions have been accrued for through purchase accounting adjustments  the company incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal and throughout fiscal  and will continue to incur  other non recurring costs which  in accordance with current accounting pronouncements  have been charged against operating gross margins

fiscal income before income taxes and extraordinary items increased by million over fiscal  excluding the effect of the restructuring charge 
this increase resulted primarily from contributions from the recent acquisitions  cost savings realized to date from rationalization initiatives  and productivity and cost reductions resulting from capital spending initiatives  and the gain recorded by the company from curtailment of the post retirement benefits which resulted from the elimination of post retirement health care costs for certain employees at the cincinnati facility 
partially offsetting these improvements were period costs associated with rationalization initiatives  higher selling and administration expenses  and higher interest expense 
depreciation and amortization increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the recent acquisitions and as a result of capital spending related to the company s cost reduction  productivity improvement  and growth initiatives
