since the company does not have the resources to cause its products to be compatible with each new technology or standard and to provide all requested functionality  the ultimate success of the company s products is dependent  to a large degree  on the company allocating its resources to developing and improving products compatible with those technologies  standards and functionalities that ultimately become widely accepted by the company s actual and prospective customers 
the company s success is also dependent  to a large degree  on the company s ability to implement arrangements with other vendors with complementary product offerings to provide actual and prospective customers greater functionality and to ensure that the company s products are compatible with the increased variety of technologies and standards 
o intense competition in the voice automation industry 
see business competition 
o ability of the company to continue to introduce new features and products as the company s markets evolve  as new technologies and standards become available  and customers demand additional functionality  requiring a continued high level of expenditures by the company for research and development 
o ability of the company to properly estimate costs under fixed price contracts in developing application software and otherwise tailoring its systems to customer specific requests 
o continued availability of suitable non proprietary computing platforms and system operating software that are compatible with the company s products 
o the quantity and size of large sales sales valued at approximately million or more during any fiscal quarter  which can cause wide variations in the company s sales on a quarter to quarter basis 
o the ability of the company to retain its customer base and  in particular  its more significant customers such as siemens ag  an intervoice distributor  which accounted for over ten percent of the company s total sales during fiscal and mci telecommunications  which accounted for over ten percent of the company s total sales during fiscal and  since such customers generally are not contractually obligated to place further orders with the company

see 
business manufacturing

additionally  changes in foreign credit markets and currency exchange rates may result in requests by many international customers for extended payment terms and may have an adverse impact on the company s cash flow and its level of accounts receivable 
o legislative and administrative changes and  in particular  changes affecting the telecommunications industry  such as the recently enacted telecommunications act of while many industry analysts expect the telecommunications act of ultimately to result in at least a temporary surge in the procurement of telecommunications equipment and related software and other products  there is no assurance that the company can estimate with sufficient accuracy those products which will ultimately be purchased  the timing of any such purchases or the quantities to be purchased 
o the company s ability to hire and retain  within the company s compensation parameters  qualified technical talent and outside contractors in highly competitive markets for the services of such personnel 
o extreme price and volume trading volatility in the us stock market  which has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many high technology companies  frequently for reasons other than the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
o increasing litigation with respect to the enforcement of patents  copyrights and other intellectual property

sales sales are derived primarily from the shipment of voice automation systems to both new and existing customers in two major market categories customer premise equipment cpe and telecommunications telco 
due to customer demand  many of the company s transactions are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
the size and timing of some transactions have historically resulted in sales fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
in the past  the impact of these fluctuations has been mitigated to some extent by vertical markets and by the geographic location of the company s existing and prospective customers 
however  the company has become more prone to quarterly sales fluctuations due to its sales to the worldwide telco market which are generally large in dollar amount and unevenly distributed throughout the fiscal year 
worldwide sales in fiscal  and increased from the immediately preceding year  and  respectively 
worldwide cpe sales increased and in fiscal years and and declined in fiscal worldwide telco sales declined in fiscal and increased and in fiscal years and cpe sales constituted  and of the company s total sales in fiscal years  and  respectively  while telco sales made up  and of the company s total sales during the same time periods 
sales of system maintenance contracts expanded to over  end users and comprised  and of the company s total sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
domestic cpe sales in fiscal  and increased  and  respectively due to the company s continued investment in the addition of new distributors and in the hiring and training of new and existing sales  service and support personnel and is expanding its marketing and advertising programs 
international cpe sales in fiscal and increased and for the same reasons as domestic cpe sales and declined in fiscal due to a lower european demand for audiotex applications 
international cpe sales constituted  and of the company s total cpe sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company believes the decline in telco sales during fiscal was attributable to temporary delays by some telecommunications companies in implementing call automation solutions while they evaluate marketing and investment strategies in the light of new opportunities resulting from deregulation under the telecommunications act of and while they also evaluate the implications of the recent judicial stay of certain provisions of the act and its regulations 
telco sales increased in fiscal and as a result of the hiring and training of new and existing sales  service and support personnel and of the expansion of marketing programs 
international telco sales constituted  and of the company s total telco sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
prices for the company s products have remained stable  as measured by price per line shipped  during fiscal  and although the features and functions per line shipped have become more robust 
accordingly  the company s sales increases are largely the result of increased unit shipments 
the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is minimal as less than of total sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
cost of goods sold during fiscal  the company experienced an increase in cost of goods sold to of total sales from and in fiscal and  respectively 
this was the result of the company s continued investment in applications engineering and customer service resources to pursue opportunities in all of its markets despite lower than anticipated sales 
the company believes  based on anticipated sales  that in fiscal its cost of goods sold  as a percentage of sales  will be slightly lower than fiscal research and development fiscal  and research and development expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
fiscal expenses included porting the company s intersoft core software to the unix and windows nt operating systems  developing computer platform independent voice automation hardware and software  and the development of visualconnect the ability to communicate with onevoice systems via the internet  mediaconnect the multi media implementation of ivr  and invision the company s next generation custom application development tool 
additionally  expenditures were made in fiscal  and for the ongoing development of the company s onevoice software agent platform including onevoice systems the company s ivr system  interdial the company s outbound predictive dialer system  onelink a digital interface for analog switches  development of invision  and continued development of interform a custom applications generation  or script building  user tool and digital vocalcard software and hardware functionality 
research and development expenses in these years also reflect the development of computer platform independent hardware and software  a voice mail system  speech recognition in both alpha and numeric format including continuous speech  voice verification  a facsimile server  the onevoice callcenter  vertical industry application packages including applications targeted for the telecommunications industry  enhancements to the products acquired in the voiceplex transaction  and international homologations the approvals required for connectivity to the telephone network in numerous international markets 
the company has not capitalized internal hardware or software development expenses 
the company expects that in fiscal it will maintain its strong commitment to research and development at a targeted percentage of anticipated sales similar to fiscal the company believes that this level of commitment should enable it to stay in the forefront of technology development in its business segment  which is essential to improving the company s position in the industry 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal as the company continued to hire and train new and existing sales  service and support personnel and expand its marketing and advertising programs worldwide 
the company expects that in fiscal it will invest in selling  general and administrative resources at a targeted percentage of anticipated sales slightly less than fiscal other income other income is primarily interest income on cash and short term investments 
the increase in other income in fiscal versus fiscal and in fiscal versus fiscal reflected the company s increased average cash balances resulting from the company s positive net cash flow income from operations in order to understand the company s operating and net income over the last three fiscal years  it must be noted that the company  during fiscal  incurred a one time charge of approximately million million net of tax in connection with the settlement of certain litigation 
additionally  during fiscal  the company purchased voiceplex corporation for approximately million in cash and approximately  shares of the company s common stock 
substantially all the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development which resulted in a one time million charge to expense with no related tax benefit 
adjusting for these one time charges  the company generated operating income of approximately million  and net income of approximately million in fiscal and operating income of approximately million and net income of approximately million in fiscal adjusted operating income in fiscal decreased versus fiscal operating income as the company increased its investment in sales  marketing  application engineering  and research and development resources at a greater rate than the increase in the company s sales in order to continue to pursue opportunities in the cpe and telco markets 
operating income in fiscal increased versus fiscal adjusted operating income as a result of a increase in the company s total sales  improved gross margins due to an increased software content in the company s systems and productivity improvements from the company s sales  marketing and administrative staffs 
adjusted net income in fiscal decreased versus fiscal net income 
adjusted fiscal net income fell at a lesser rate than adjusted fiscal operating income due to a favorable tax rate versus fiscal resulting from the recognition of the cumulative losses of a foreign subsidiary 
net income in fiscal increased versus fiscal adjusted net income 
fiscal net income grew at a slightly faster rate than operating income due to a favorable tax rate versus fiscal as a result of increased sales through the company s foreign sales corporation any anticipated increases in operating income and net income are expected to be at a rate generally commensurate with the percentage increase in anticipated sales 
liquidity and capital resources the company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents at february   up from million at february  this increase is attributable to the company s internally generated cash flow 
the company believes that its cash reserves and internally generated cash flow will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company reviews share repurchase and acquisition opportunities from time to time and believes it has or has access to the financial resources necessary to pursue attractive repurchase and or acquisition opportunities as they arise 
as of may   the company has repurchased  shares of its common stock pursuant to an authorization by its board of directors to repurchase up to  shares 
the company believes that market conditions made such shares of value to its shareholders 
impact of inflation the company does not expect any significant short term impact of inflation on its financial condition 
technological advances should continue to reduce costs in the computer and communications industries 
further  the company presently is not bound by long term fixed price sales contracts and has no long term debt obligations  which should reduce the company s exposure to inflationary effects
