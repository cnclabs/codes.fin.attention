item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview although net revenue for the year was down  or over fiscal levels  reflecting the  decline in peri strips revenue  fiscal has many successes to report 
the company continues to see impressive growth from its core tissue guard product line  excluding peri strips 
in particular within the tissue guard product line  dura guard  vascu guard  peri guard and supple peri guard had significant revenue increases in the year  increasing  or over fiscal revenues 
in the surgical productivity tools product line  flo rester experienced excellent revenue growth  increasing  or over fiscal previous flo rester annual revenue increases have been in the range 
fourth quarter fiscal net revenues exceeded fiscal fourth quarter revenue by  this is the first quarter in which net revenues increased over the comparable prior year quarter since the hcfa non coverage decision in january of fourth quarter revenue growth was again led by dura guard  vascu guard and supple peri guard 
during fiscal the company launched peri strips dry  an advanced version of peri strips initially targeted for the european market  and is close to final development on two new products in the tissue guard product line 
the company also brought the manufacture of the bio vascular probe in house which will allow the company greater control over the manufacture of this growing product 
the company continues to expend significant time and resources in the research and development of new applications using its core tissue products and tissue processing technology 
domestic revenue from peri strips continued to be significantly affected by the hcfa decision in january of for lvrs 
domestic revenue from peri strips was down from fiscal the company believes that some hospitals in the us are no longer promoting lvrs cases 
however  the company is encouraged that surgeons and other medical professionals continue to seek training on the lvr surgical procedure 
peri strips fiscal revenue was also down from the company s original expectations due to a delay in the start date for a study of lvrs  the national emphysema treatment trial nett sponsored jointly by hcfa and nih 
see medicare non coverage decision on page for a more in depth discussion 
the start date is subject to the completion of organizational and procedural activities 
the company had orginally received indications that the study would commence in june the company accordingly anticipated demand for the peri strips product associated with the hcfa study and corresponding peri strips revenue in the second half of fiscal the company now believes that the earliest surgeries under the study will begin is january there can be no assurance  however  that further delays will not impact the commencement of surgeries under the study  or that the study will proceed on the basis anticipated by the company  if at all  as the study is subject to determinations made by hcfa and nih and is beyond the control of the company 
peri strips dry was launched in july the company believes that the peri strips dry design provides significant advantages for thorascopic surgical procedures over the original peri strips sleeve design 
peri strips dry eliminates the need to extract through the thorascope the sutured sleeve backing that was part of the original design 
a specially formulated psd gel enables the peri strip dry strip to adhere to the surgical stapler 
thorascopic procedures are currently estimated to comprise of the total lvr surgeries performed in europe 
the majority of surgeons in europe have performed lvrs without benefit of a staple line buttress 
the company was successful in convincing a leading european thoracic surgeon to evaluate peri strips dry 
this surgeon is now the lead investigator for the company s marketing clinical trials currently underway at three european sites 
the company expects european revenue growth from peri strips dry and peri strips will be gradual as reimbursement is obtained on a country by country basis 
however  this forward looking statement is dependent upon the receipt of reimbursement approval from european countries  and will be negatively impacted by any failure or delay in receiving such reimbursement approvals 
currently  european patients pay directly for the product 
in the us  peri strips dry is expected to replace the original peri strips sleeve configuration for thorascopic procedures 
the spin off of vital images on may   the company completed the spin off distribution of all the shares of vital images to the shareholders of bio vascular  with vital images thereafter operating as an independent public company 
vital images is currently traded on the otc bulletin board under the symbol vtal 
all bio vascular shareholders received one share of vital images common stock for each two shares of bio vascular stock held  with cash issued in lieu of fractional shares 
the company attempted to structure the transaction as tax free  but since no advance ruling was sought from the internal revenue service  no assurance can be made about the final tax treatment of the transaction 
both organizations should benefit from a tighter focus on their respective markets  be able to invest in research and development at levels appropriate to their respective stages of development and be able to evolve unique organizational and marketing structures to better serve their substantially different markets 
as a result of the company s spin off of vital images  the company s financial statements and notes thereto report the business of vital images as discontinued operations 
medicare non coverage decision effective january   hcfa made a non coverage decision with respect to lvrs  a surgical treatment for late stage emphysema 
this decision significantly impacted the company s revenues from sales of peri strips 
at the time that this non coverage decision was put into effect  the company estimates that approximately of the patients undergoing lvrs were medicare patients 
while the company understands that several private insurance companies and managed care organizations continue to reimburse lvrs based on their own evaluation of the procedure and its outcomes  it is unknown whether these private payers will change their reimbursement practices in the future or if more private payers will begin to cover the procedure 
nih  in collaboration with hcfa  has outlined and is in the process of organizing a prospective  randomized study of lvrs  the nett study  to determine whether it is safe and efficacious 
the nett study  as it is currently structured  is limited to a small number of patients relative to the number of medicare dependent patients who would be otherwise eligible for the procedure 
congress  responding to the concerns of their constituents and in light of a significant number of favorable peer reviewed published medical articles bearing out the safety and efficacy of lvrs  requested hcfa to present to congress updated information on the lvrs procedure by january hcfa requested an extension until april and as of the date of this report had not yet complied with congress request 
because hcfa and nih appear intent on proceeding with the study  no assumptions can be made as to whether the efforts of congress or the mounting evidence regarding the benefits of this procedure will cause them to alter the study 
the company continues to work for restoration of coverage of lvrs for medicare dependent patients 
results of continuing operations comparison of the year ended october  with the year ended october  revenue decreased to  from  primarily due to the decrease in peri strips revenue 
peri strips revenue decreased  to  from  revenue from sales of other tissue guard products  dura guard  vascu guard  peri guard and supple peri guard increased  to  from  all tissue guard products showed significant increases over the prior year 
increased revenues from tissue guard products in the fourth quarter of fiscal over the same quarter in fiscal more than offset the decreased revenue from peri strips for the first time since the hcfa decision in january of biograft revenue decreased  or  to  from  continuing a trend representative of the late stage of this product s life cycle 
revenue from sales of surgical productivity tools flo rester and the bio vascular probe increased to  from  the gross margin percentage was for and for during fiscal and the gross margin percentages declined through the quarters  primarily due to decreases in production volume in response to decreases in demand for peri strips 
the gross margin percentage was by the fourth quarter of and continued to decrease through the third quarter of gross margin improvements in the fourth quarter of were primarily due to increased production volume 
the company expects the gross margin percentage for to be slightly higher than the level 
this forward looking statement is influenced primarily by the company s current estimate of standard costs and would be impacted by significant increases or decreases in production volumes of the company s products  by material changes in the company s product mix and by the accuracy of the company s estimates of standard costs and other manufacturing costs 
selling  general and administrative expense increased  or between and general and administrative expenses increased  or  and was due in part to increases in regulatory personnel and related market clearance costs 
selling expense increased  or 
increases in selling costs originated from the launch of peri strips dry in the third quarter of  increased marketing efforts in europe including the addition of a european sales manager and renewed focus in the domestic marketplace of the company s strong line of tissue products 
the company has maintained and judiciously added to the basic corporate infrastructure which was developed during to support the company s rapid growth at that time 
although the rapid growth  which was fueled by peri strips was interrupted  the infrastructure that was built to support that growth is vital to moving the company forward to the next level of its corporate strategy 
the company continued to incur expenses related to efforts to inform congress and other interested parties of the devastating effect of the hcfa decision on patients in the late stages of emphysema and to seek consideration of a modification or reversal of that decision 
research and development expense increased  or between and  with the increase primarily due to the cost of moving projects forward in the research and development pipeline  including an increase in the number of animal studies 
the company has several projects under development including the company s small diameter graft 
r d efforts have included two new product opportunities  cv peri guard and ocu guard  which are expected to generate revenues in fiscal r d expense is expected to increase as these and other projects continue to progress 
this forward looking statement will be influenced primarily by the number of projects  the related r d personnel requirements  the development path and success of each project  the expected costs  and the timing of these costs 
primarily due to the continued decrease in revenue from peri strips  componded by lower gross margins earlier in the year and increased spending on research and development  regulatory and selling costs  continuing operations had an operating loss in of  as compared to operating income of  for other income  primarily interest income  was  and  in and  respectively 
as a result  continuing operations had a loss before income taxes in of  as compared to income from continuing operations before income tax of  in the company s provision for income taxes in is  including a  write off of an income tax asset in the third quarter 
the company expected to utilize a significant portion of vital images net operating loss carryforwards against the company s anticipated fiscal taxable income 
these net operating losses were generated by vital images prior to its spin off and are only available to the company in the fiscal year  reverting solely to vital images thereafter 
when the company realized its fiscal taxable income would fall short of original expectations  the deferred tax asset had no further value to bio vascular and was written off in the third quarter 
in  the company allocated its provision for income taxes to continuing and discontinuing operations based on their respective pretax income contributions and tax attributes 
as a result  the amount of the provision allocated to continuing operations in was  representing an effective tax rate of approximately 
continuing operations effective tax rate for reflected the benefit of recognizing a deferred tax asset associated with capital loss and research and experimentation credit carryforwards created in prior years 
loss from continuing operations was  or per share in  compared to income of  or per share in comparison of the year ended october  with the year ended october  revenue decreased to  from  primarily due to the decrease in peri strips revenue resulting from the hcfa decision  offset substantially by an increase in revenue from sales of other tissue guard products 
peri strips revenue decreased  to  from  revenue from sales of other tissue guard products  dura guard  vascu guard  peri guard and supple peri guard  increased by  to  from  primarily due to the increase in revenue from dura guard  which was cleared to market by the fda in june revenue from sales of biograft decreased to  from  revenues from the sales of biograft have been decreasing since late as new competitive treatments reached the market 
revenue from sales of surgical productivity tools flo rester and the bio vascular probe increased to  from  the gross margin percentage was for and for while the annual gross margin percentages appeared stable  they were not on a quarter to quarter basis during in  the gross margin percentage was increasing  primarily due to rapidly increasing production volume associated with rising peri strips sales  while in  the gross margin percentages declined  primarily due to decreases in the production volume in response to decreases in expected demand for peri strips as a result of the hcfa decision 
selling  general and administrative expense increased  or between and increases were generally across all functions and due in large part to the presence during much of of a complete basic corporate infrastructure  expenses related to the development of a quality system under iso and expenses related to efforts to inform congress and other interested parties of the devastating effect of the hcfa decision on patients in the late stages of emphysema and to seek consideration of a modification or reversal of that decision 
research and development expense increased between and  with the increase primarily due to the cost of moving projects forward in the research and development pipeline and including an increase in animal studies 
the increase in infrastructure  the increased level of business activities and the acceleration and expansion of research and development efforts  resulted in operating income of  compared to  for other income was  and  in and  respectively and consisted primarily of interest income 
a secondary public offering which the company completed in september of provided approximately  net of offering costs 
this comprised the basis for the increase in interest income in over the company allocated its provision for income taxes to continuing and discontinued operations based on their respective pretax income contribution and tax attributes 
as a result  continuing operations recorded a tax provision of  for and  for  representing an effective tax rate of approximately in both years 
continuing operations effective tax rate in reflected the benefit of utilizing remaining net operating loss carry forwards to offset income 
continuing operations effective tax rate for reflected the benefit of recognizing a deferred tax asset associated with capital loss and research and experimentation credit carryforwards created in prior years 
income from continuing operations was  or per share  compared to  or per share for liquidity and capital resources for the year ended october   activities from continuing operations provided cash of  excluding  used by discontinued operations as compared to  excluding  used by discontinued operations of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal cash was provided by continuing operations in fiscal through non cash expenses  increases in accrued liabilities  decreases in inventories and non trade receivables in excess of the loss from continuing operations 
these increases in cash were partially offset by an increase in trade accounts receivable 
the company invested  in equipment and leasehold improvements primarily related to new manufacturing processes related to peri strips dry and the bio vascular probe 
financing activities included  provided from stock option exercises and a related tax benefit  net of restricted stock repurchased from employees 
in addition  the company used  to repurchase shares of its own common stock in the open market in accordance with the company s ongoing stock repurchase program 
this program was announced in august whereby the company stated its intention to repurchase up to  shares of its common stock 
such purchases will be made in the open market from time to time as price opportunities arise 
the company believes existing cash and investments will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
at october   the company has cash and investments totaling  at october   the company s cash and investments totaled  the net decrease in cash and investments was largely attributable to the  funded to vital images 
the year issue computer designs that use microprocessors have consistently abbreviated dates by eliminating the first two digits of the year under the assumption that these two digits would always be as the year approaches  such systems will be unable to accurately process certain date based information 
this problem is commonly referred to as the year issue 
the company has not yet determined if it will be necessary to modify or replace significant portions of its software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations or on its financial condition 
foreign currency transactions substantially all of the company s foreign transactions are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates in other countries may therefore reduce the demand for the company s products by increasing the price of the company s products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold
