six months ended december  compared to six months ended december earnings before the extraordinary loss related to the extinguishment of debt for the six months ended december  decreased to million from million in the same period a year earlier

the six months ended december  also included an extraordinary loss of million  net of tax  as a result of the debt restructuring described above 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements arise mainly from its working capital needs  primarily accounts receivable and inventory 
the company does not offer financing to its customers 
fsi customers are billed for of each order eight weeks in advance of the publication date and are billed for the balance immediately prior to the publication date 
the company inventories its work in progress at cost while it accrues progress billings at full sales value 
therefore  the progress billings on the balance sheet include the amount of the gross margin 
because these practices are consistent  and receivables and payables are reasonably predictable  the company can operate with low  or even negative  working capital  and under normal circumstances  does not need to generate additional funds to cover the shortfall 
management believes that the company will generate sufficient funds from operations and have sufficient lines of credit available to meet its currently anticipated liquidity requirements  including interest expense under the notes and the credit facility 
restrictions as to the amount of dividends which may be paid exist under the credit facility and the indenture covering the notes

it is expected that equipment will be obtained from funds provided by operations
