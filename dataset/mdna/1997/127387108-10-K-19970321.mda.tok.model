the increase was attributed to increased sales volume of its automatic place and route  physical layout and verification  and timing driven design process tools 
also  demand increased for electronic systems design automation esda products  produced by the company s alta group  which are designed to allow customers to include product concepts in the eda environment by accelerating and enhancing the early phases of system development 
the increase in product revenue in was exemplified by increased sales volume of its ic  automated test equipment ate hardware business  top down design and alta group s systems design products 
the increases in services revenue in and were the result of significant demand for the company s spectrum services offerings  which provide a range of solutions to address the product development needs of its customers 
the increase in services revenue was driven by an outsourcing agreement with unisys corporation unisys to assume a substantial portion of unisys internal silicon design operation 
this five year agreement was signed in march for a total contract value of at least million 
the decreased services revenue growth rate in  as compared to  was due to a small services revenue base in the increase in maintenance revenue was attributable to an increase in the company s installed base of products 
the decreased maintenance revenue growth rate in  as compared to  was due to customers renewing maintenance contracts at a slower rate in as compared with revenue from international sources was approximately million  million and million  or  and of total revenue for  and  respectively

the increase in cost of product in absolute dollars in  as compared to  was primarily due to the increased cost of revenue associated with its ate products resulting from higher product demand  as well as increased purchased software amortization and the write off of million of capitalized software development costs related to products at the end of their life cycle 
the decrease in cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in  as compared to  was primarily due to revenues growing at a faster rate than costs 
the decrease in cost of product in absolute dollars and as a percentage of product revenue in  as compared to  was primarily due to productivity improvements in the software release and production process  and a reduction in printing and manufacturing costs due to decreased demand for manuals  partly offset by increased cost of revenue associated with its ate products resulting from higher product demand 
cost of services revenue includes personnel and related costs associated with providing services to customers and the infrastructure to manage a services organization  as well as costs to recruit  develop and retain services professionals

while primarily focused on serving the needs of unisys  the design and services resources acquired by the company are also being used to support other customers design needs 
the improvement in services gross margins to in  as compared to in  was due to increased operating efficiencies attained within existing services offerings 
continued investment in developing new services offerings and the cost of integrating new services professionals performing a growing number of services offerings will continue to put pressure on services gross margins until operating efficiencies are obtained 
cost of maintenance revenue includes the cost of customer services such as hot line and on site support and the production cost of the maintenance renewal process

the increase in was primarily due to increased earnings on cash investments resulting from higher interest rates during than during interest expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in  as compared to  was attributable to a larger notes payable balance being maintained during a majority of as compared to the increase in interest expense in  as compared to  was due to an increase in notes payable related to the purchase of corporate facilities in the first and fourth quarters of the note payable related to the first facility purchase was paid in full in may  and the note payable related to the second facility purchase was paid in full in october included in other income was an million gain on the sale of approximately of the stock of ims  a previously wholly owned subsidiary  in an initial public offering 
in  other income included a million gain related to the sale of an equity investment 
income taxes in millions provision for income taxes effective tax rate as of december   the company had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million against which the company had recorded a valuation allowance of million  resulting in net deferred tax assets of million 
a significant portion of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards which created the deferred tax assets was generated by acquired companies prior to their mergers with the company and by restructuring charges recorded as a result of these mergers 
approximately million of these deferred tax assets will affect equity and intangibles and will not be available to offset future provisions for income taxes 
realization of the net deferred tax assets of million is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss and tax credit carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of million will be realized 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts  including the estimate of future taxable income  differ from those estimated 
the tax rate without the fourth quarter write off of million of in process research and development costs associated with the hlds acquisition which is not deductible for tax purposes was 
the increase in the tax rate  as compared to the tax rate  excluding this fourth quarter write off  was primarily due to an increase in state income taxes and a smaller reduction in the valuation allowance 
the increase in the tax rate  as compared to the tax rate  was attributable to an increase in foreign earnings which were subject to a higher tax rate than the us tax rate  the related cost of repatriating these earnings and an increase in state income taxes 
the company anticipates that its effective tax rate will remain at in liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and short term investments as compared with million and million at december  and december   respectively  and a three year  million secured revolving line of credit agreement 
as of december   the company had no borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
cash generated from operating activities decreased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other  and lower deferred income taxes  partially offset by an increase in net income prior to the write off of in process research and development  an increase in accrued liabilities and payables  and higher deferred revenue 
cash generated from operating activities increased million in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to higher net income and increases in accrued liabilities and payables  and deferred revenue  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 
at december   the company had net working capital of million compared with million at december  the primary reasons for the increase were net proceeds from the company s secondary public offering of million  increases in accounts receivable of million and in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  partly offset by an increase in deferred revenue of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was attributable to increased billing activity late in the year 
the increase in deferred revenue was attributable to increased maintenance renewals and an increase in deferred product revenue 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily attributable to payments expected to be made in early  including bonus and commissions payments  sales taxes and issuances of stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan espp 
in addition to its short term investments  the company s primary investing activities were purchases of property and equipment  purchases of software and intangibles and the capitalization of software development costs  which combined represented million and million of cash used for investing activities in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
since  as part of its authorized stock repurchase program  the company has sold put warrants and purchased call options through private placements 
the company had a maximum potential obligation related to the put warrants at december  to buy back million shares of its common stock at an aggregate price of approximately million 
the put warrants will expire in march through september the company has both the unconditional right and the intent to settle these put warrants with stock and  therefore  no amount was classified out of stockholders equity in the accompanying balance sheet 
the effect of the exercise of these put warrants and call options is reported in stockholders equity 
in connection with and prior to the consummation of the cct merger  the company will rescind its stock repurchase program  with the exception of continued systematic stock repurchases under its seasoned stock repurchase program for the company s espp 
such repurchases are intended to cover the company s expected re issuances under the espp for the next months 
anticipated cash requirements for include the purchase of treasury stock through the exercise of call options for the company s seasoned systematic stock repurchase program and the contemplated additions of property  plant and equipment of approximately million 
as part of its overall investment strategy  the company has committed to participating in a venture capital partnership as a limited partner 
the company s total committed investment of at least million will be made over the next two to three years 
as of december   the company had contributed approximately million  which is reflected in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet 
the company anticipates that current cash and short term investment balances  cash flows from operations  and the million revolving line of credit should be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements on a short and long term basis 
factors that may affect future results because of rapid technological changes in the eda industry  the company s future revenues will depend on its ability to develop or acquire new products and enhance its existing products on a timely basis to keep pace with innovations in technology and to support a range of changing computer software and hardware platforms and customer preferences 
changes in manufacturing technology may render the company s software tools obsolete 
lack of market acceptance or significant delays in product development could result in a loss of competitiveness of the company s products  with a resulting loss of revenues 
the company has been involved in a number of significant merger and acquisition transactions 
these transactions have been motivated by many factors  including the desire to obtain new technologies  the desire to expand and enhance the company s product lines and the desire to attract key personnel 
growth through acquisition has several identifiable risks  including risks related to integration of the previously distinct businesses into a single unit  the substantial management time devoted to such activities  undisclosed liabilities  the failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings and synergies and issues related to product transition such as distribution  engineering  and customer support 
during the fourth quarter of  the company acquired hlds and entered into a merger agreement with cct mergers 
both mergers have several identifiable risks  including those described above 
to maintain and increase profitability  the company  hlds  and cct will need to successfully integrate and streamline overlapping functions 
costs generally associated with this type of integration that may be incurred by the company include the write off of capitalized software  severance payments  closing of excess facilities  and disposition of excess equipment 
while some of these costs have not been currently identified  any such costs will have an adverse effect on the company s operating results in the periods in which they are incurred 
the company  hlds  and cct each have different systems and procedures in many operational areas that must be rationalized and integrated 
there can be no assurance that such integration will be accomplished smoothly  expeditiously or successfully 
failure to effectively accomplish the integration of the operations of the company  hlds and cct could have a material adverse effect on cadence s results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  uncertainty in the marketplace or customer hesitation relating to the mergers could negatively affect the company s results of operations 
among the conditions that must be fulfilled in order to consummate the cct merger is the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the cct merger under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended the hsr act 
the review of the merger pursuant to the hsr act may substantially delay the company s ability to consummate the merger 
there can be no assurance that a challenge to the cct merger on antitrust grounds will not be made  or if such a challenge is made  the company will prevail or would not be required to terminate the merger agreement  divest certain assets  license certain proprietary technology or accept certain conditions in order to consummate the cct merger 
in addition  the company has the right to waive the condition that the cct merger be qualified for pooling of interests accounting treatment 
if the cct merger is consummated but fails to qualify for pooling of interests accounting treatment  then the transaction would be accounted for as a purchase 
accounting for the cct merger as a purchase could result in a significant intangible asset or a significant charge against results of operations or both  which could materially and adversely affect future results of operations 
there can be no assurance that all of the aforementioned conditions will be satisfied or waived  and therefore  there can be no assurance that the cct merger will be consummated 
during the first quarter of  the company completed the reorganization of its sales force and other operating groups into business units 
these business units alta  deep submicron  logic verification  full custom and performance engineering are focused on delivering solutions to customers for specific areas of the design process 
short term customer uncertainty relating to this reorganization could negatively affect the company s results of operations 
the company s operating expenses are partially based on its expectations regarding future revenue 
the company s results of operations may be adversely affected if revenue does not materialize in a quarter as anticipated 
since expenses are usually committed in advance of revenues and because only a small portion of expenses vary with revenue  the company s operating results may be impacted significantly by lower revenue which would be attributable to various factors and could affect quarter to quarter comparisons 
the company s focus on providing services is relatively recent 
the percentage revenue growth from this source from to may not be indicative of future growth 
in addition  a substantial portion of the company s revenues from services are earned pursuant to fixed price contracts 
variances in costs associated with those contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company s revenues are not generally seasonal in nature  the company has experienced  and may continue to experience  decreases in first quarter revenue compared with the preceding fourth quarter  which is believed to result primarily from the capital purchase cycle of the company s customers 
the company is dependent upon the efforts and abilities of its senior management  its research and development staff and a number of other key management  sales  support  technical and services personnel 
as noted above  the company has recently increased its focus on offering professional services to its customers 
to the extent that the company is not able to attract  retain  train  and motivate highly skilled employees who are able to provide services that satisfy customers expectations  the company s business and operating results would be adversely affected 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenues 
the company s international operations involve a number of risks normally associated with such operations  including  among others  adoption and expansion of government trade restrictions  volatile foreign exchange rates  currency conversion risks  limitations on repatriation of earnings  reduced protection of intellectual property rights  the impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the us  longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing foreign operations  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs and other trade barriers 
currency exchange fluctuations in countries in which the company conducts business could also materially adversely affect cadence s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
although the company attempts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  significant exchange rate movements may have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
due to the foregoing  as well as other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
in addition  the company s participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
any change in revenues or operating results below levels expected by securities analysts for the company or its competitors  and the timing of the announcement of such shortfalls  could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period
