item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations discontinued operations during the years and  the company derived most of its revenues from providing full service automobile insurance services policy processing  policy administration and claims administration through its isd business 
the company has also provided state of the art computer products for the property casualty insurance industry through its wholly owned subsidiary  cover all 
isd revenues in and primarily consisted of policy administration and claims servicing fees from customers such as atlantic pacific employers insurance company and to a lesser extent  clarendon national insurance company clarendon  for servicing policies in the new jersey voluntary and assigned risk markets 
the contract with atlantic pacific employers insurance company reached its peak level of activity in and policy volumes declined sharply in during and  atlantic pacific employers insurance company planned to non renew all of their auto insurance policies in new jersey in accordance with the accelerated withdrawal order entered into with the new jersey department of insurance in august in addition  the mtf program had been phasing out since and  as of march   the company s contracted activity for the mtf ended 
revenues earned under the contract with clarendon involved full service policy administration and claims services for approximately percent of the assigned risk drivers in new jersey 
this activity started in with the commencement of the new jersey personal automobile insurance plan paip following the end of new jersey s direct insurance program provided by its mtf 
the company s service for clarendon was performed under new jersey s limited assignment distribution program lad which required that servicing carriers such as the company bear some of the underlying insurance risk of the policies being handled 
for this reason  the company formed a wholly owned insurance subsidiary  alerion  and effective january   alerion reinsured a portion of clarendon s insurance risk under the paip program 
by the end of  the company decided that risk taking  even as a reinsurer  was not an attractive business strategy  particularly because of the substantial capital required by its insurance subsidiary relative to other company capital commitments 
the company and clarendon agreed  therefore  to end the reinsurance arrangement in the fourth quarter of and commute all reinsurance interests and liabilities back to the inception of the agreement  thus eliminating all reinsurance activity of alerion 
this had the effect of reducing revenues by million and operating income by 
million in the fourth quarter of since the company was no longer willing to share in the underlying insurance risk of paip policies  it could not  by law  continue to provide policy administration and claims servicing to clarendon under the lad program after most of the company s insurance services contracts included a variable fee structure based on the loss ratios of the underlying insurance policies which could increase or decrease fee revenues 
the company obtained periodic independent actuarial evaluations of the loss ratios for these programs and adjusted the amount of its revenue when required 
subsequent to december   the company obtained independent actuarial projections of loss adjustment expenses expected to be incurred in and beyond with respect to the company s contractual obligations under its insurance services contracts 
as a result of this review  the company determined that its deferred contract revenues at the end of should be increased by million to adequately cover contract costs and profit margins in and beyond 
this change in accounting estimate was recorded in the fourth quarter of as a reduction of insurance services revenue

in march  the company entered into a series of agreements resulting in the settlement and dismissal of the lawsuits and the release of the company from continuing obligations under contracts for the provision of insurance services to isd customers 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the various financial elements of those agreements 
in essence  the company no longer offers full service automobile insurance services  and its isd operations have been transferred to a subsidiary of the robert plan corporation which has replaced the company as a service provider to such customers
