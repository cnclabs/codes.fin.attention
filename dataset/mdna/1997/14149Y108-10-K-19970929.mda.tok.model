results of operations net revenues 
net revenues for fiscal increased  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to growth in the company s pharmaceutical distribution and pharmacy management service businesses 
the increase resulted mostly from internal growth generated primarily by the addition of new customers  and  to a lesser extent  increased volume from existing customers and price increases 
expansion of the company s relationship with kmart corporation kmart and opportunities created by the deterioration of the financial condition of a major pharmaceutical distribution competitor also contributed to the increases during fiscal net revenues in fiscal increased compared with fiscal primarily due to internal growth from pharmaceutical wholesaling activities  mostly due to the addition of new customers  and  to a lesser extent  increased sales to existing customers and price increases 
gross margin

the change in gross margin for the year is primarily due to the shift in net revenue mix caused by significant increases in the relatively lower margin pharmaceutical distribution activities the impact of this shift was partially offset by increased merchandising and marketing programs with customers and suppliers 
the company s gross margin continues to be affected by the combination of a highly competitive environment and a greater mix of high volume customers  where a lower cost of service and better asset management enable the company to offer lower selling margins and still achieve higher operating margins relative to other customer business 
the gross margin ratio increased to for fiscal from in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the gross margin generated from the acquisition of a pharmacy management operation in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
pharmacy management operations generally provide a higher gross margin than pharmaceutical wholesaling activities

the company s trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand its role as a provider of services to the healthcare industry 
this trend has resulted in both expansion of its pharmaceutical distribution business and diversification into related service areas which a complement the company s core pharmaceutical distribution business  b provide opportunities for the company to develop synergies with  and thus strengthen  the acquired business  and c generally generate higher margins as a percentage of net revenues than pharmaceutical distribution 
as the healthcare industry continues to change  the company is constantly evaluating acquisition candidates in pharmaceutical distribution  as well as related sectors of the healthcare industry that would expand its role as a service provider  however  there can be no assurance that it will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction 
if a transaction was consummated  additional merger related costs would be incurred by the company

partially offsetting this increase in fiscal is the impact of the extinguishment of the company s million notes on march  provision for income taxes

the increase in trade receivables is consistent with the company s revenue growth see net revenues above 
the change in cash and equivalents  marketable securities available for sale and accounts payable is due to the timing of inventory purchases and related payments
