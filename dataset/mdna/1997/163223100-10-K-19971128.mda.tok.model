liquidity and capital resources at august   the company had working capital of cdn  us  a decrease of cdn  from working capital of cdn  us  at august  this decrease is primarily due to the increased debt load assumed on the acquisition of the magic lantern group 
for the fiscal year  the company had a net increase in cash flow of cdn  us  an increase from its net decrease in cash flow of cdn  us  for the fiscal year 
net positive cash flow for the fiscal year was cdn  us 
the increase in net cash flow for the fiscal year was primarily due to cash provided from operations 
cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year was cdn  us  an increase of cdn  from cash used by operating activities for the fiscal year 
the major factors contributing to this increase from the fiscal year include an increase in net income before depreciation and amortization of cdn  us  a decrease in short term investments of cdn  us  a decrease in inventory of cdn  us  due to an increased level of inventory converted to rental equipment during the year  a decrease in prepaid expenses of cdn  us  and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and income taxes payable of cdn  us  and cdn  us  respectively  due mainly to expanding operations  higher debt load  and higher effective tax rates in  respectively

also  inventory increased by cdn  us  as required to service the increase in group subscriber locations  prepaid expenses increased by cdn  us  and accounts receivable increased by cdn  us  in the fiscal year  primarily due to increased sales levels 
cash used in investing activities in both the fiscal year and fiscal year was cdn  us  and cdn  us  respectively 
cash used in the fiscal year was greater than in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the company s purchase of the magic lantern group totaling cdn  us  the investment in viewer services of cdn  us  by magic and the purchase of certain of the business assets and the resulting goodwill of image media by magic for cdn  us 
the above uses of cash were somewhat offset by the decrease in notes receivable in the fiscal year of cdn  us 
cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year was cdn  us  which decreased by cdn  from the amount provided by financing activities of cdn  us  in the fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to the fact that in the fiscal year  the company received net proceeds of cdn  us  on the issuance of  shares of its common stock compared to only cdn  us  of net proceeds received on shares issued in the fiscal year 
the company believes that its working capital position provides the required liquidity on both a short and long term basis and that its will not require external financing for its operating activities during the fiscal year  as based upon the company s present plans for the fiscal year

no arrangements are presently in place for outside financing should the need arise 
inflation the rate of inflation has had little impact on the company s operations or financial position during the three fiscal years ended august   and inflation is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s operations or financial position during the fiscal year 
the company pays a number of its suppliers  including its licensor and principal supplier  communications  in us dollars 
therefore  fluctuations in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar will have an impact on gross profit as well as the net income of the company 
if the value of the canadian dollar falls against the us dollar  the cost of sales of the company will increase thereby reducing the company s gross profit and net income 
conversely  if the value of the canadian dollar rises against the us dollar  gross profit and net income will increase
