this is a forward looking statement and is inherently uncertain 
actual results may differ materially 
the company s ability to fund its working capital requirements and capital expenditures will depend in large part on the company s compliance with covenants in the lasalle facility 
no assurance can be given that the company will remain in compliance with such covenants throughout the term of the lasalle facility 
the company s balance sheet as of december  reflected a net deferred tax asset of approximately million 
a valuation allowance exists as of this date because based on the weight of all available evidence  management believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax asset will be fully realized 
the company  from time to time  reviews the possible acquisition of other products or businesses 
the company s ability to expand successfully through acquisition depends on many factors  including the successful identification and acquisition of products or businesses and the company s ability to integrate and operate the acquired products or businesses successfully 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in acquiring or integrating any such products or businesses 
seasonality consumer demand for beverage products distributed by the company tends to be greater during warmer months 
accordingly  the company s beverage sales and profits are generally highest in the second and third calendar quarters 
management believes that this effect will be mitigated by the results of its food operations which are less dependent on seasonal factors
