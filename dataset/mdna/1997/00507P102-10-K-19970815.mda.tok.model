results of operations during fiscal  ended june   the company had combined gross revenues from operations of  as compared to  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal total cost of revenues during fiscal were  as compared to  for fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal as a result  the company realized gross profit from operations of  during fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in gross revenues during fiscal  approximately above fiscal  was primarily due to the expansion of the company s operations through i the increased sales by its subsidiary actrade sa and ii significantly increased revenues by actrade capital inc capital through its tad program  discussed separately below see ii 
revenues segment information actrade capital  inc and the trade acceptance draft program 
the increase in revenues in fiscal was the result of increased product sales by actrade sa  rather than from price increases for the company s products  and substantially increased operating revenues derived from capital 
after selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  interest income and expenses  and provision for taxes  including an extraordinary benefit from utilization of net operating loss carry forward  the company realized a net operating profit of  or per share  as compared to  or per share  for fiscal and  or per share  in fiscal this represented an increase in net operating profits for fiscal of approximately above fiscal during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses showed a significant increase to  as compared to  for fiscal  an increase of approximately 
however  when expressed as a percentage of overall revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented approximately of total revenues for fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal 
additionally  approximately  of this amount was due directly to capital s expanded operations during fiscal management projects the costs related to capital s operations will continue to escalate in fiscal  particularly as it accelerates its marketing efforts for the tad program see ii 
revenues segment information actrade capital  inc and the trade acceptance draft program 
historically  the company s net operating income expressed as a percentage of gross revenues increased from during fiscal to a previous high of at the end of the third quarter of fiscal prior to the impact of the costs associated with capital s operations 
as had been expected  following the introduction of capital s tad program  this ratio fell to its all time low of at the end of fiscal  but began to recover significantly in fiscal when it rose to at the end of fiscal and at the end of fiscal during fiscal  due principally to significantly increased revenues from capital s tad program and actrade sa  this ratio continued its upward trend and  at the end of fiscal  reached an all time high of 
management believes that this ratio may level off during fiscal  due to the anticipated balance between the cost of its accelerated marketing program and the expected increased revenues from capital s operations 
during fiscal  management decided to defer expansion of allstate s operations due primarily to the concentration of its personnel and resources in the import export business of actrade 
in light of management s continued emphasis on the expansion of actrade s export operations and the ongoing expansion of capital s tad program  management has elected to terminate allstate s operations and to phase out this aspect of its operations during fiscal during fiscal  allstate s total sales aggregated only  which represented only a very slight increase in gross revenues from fiscal  and accounted for less than of of the company s total revenues 
as of june   of the company s total trade accounts receivable in the amount of  approximately have been collected as of the date of this report and  of the balance  approximately  are secured by commercial documentary drafts  and approximately  are open account 
this does not include  in trade acceptance drafts receivable which  for the most part  have been sold to an independent financial institution and which are insured see financial statements  note ii 
revenue segment information 
until fiscal  the company s revenues were comprised solely of export sales by actrade and revenues earned by allstate s travel agency business 
during fiscal the company  through capital  realized the first revenues from its newly introduced tad program 
since its introduction  capital s revenues have continued to increase to the point where it now constitutes the single largest revenue segment for the company

actrade capital inc and the trade acceptance draft program 
following a complete revision of the operating plan for capital in late fiscal  management developed new trade financing programs intended to be marketed to domestic companies in the united states 
although a departure from the company s core business of international trade  management be lieved that a strong demand for new  innovative trade financing methods exists among small to medium sized american companies 
in late fiscal  capital offered its first financial program to assist companies in the management and collection of small open accounts receivable the tad program 
during fiscal  the first full year of operations for this program  although still in its development stage  capital generated gross revenues of  as compared to  during fiscal during fiscal the company incurred general and administrative expenses directly attributable to capital s operations of  resulting in a loss from capital s operations  before interest income and expenses  of  after interest income of  interest expense of  and provision for taxes of  the net loss from operations for capital during fiscal was  although showing a modest loss  capital s operating results for fiscal exceeded management s expectations 
during fiscal  management decided to implement an aggressive new marketing plan for the tad program  principally in response to the perceived need to educate potential participants in the program about how trade acceptances work and how they could benefit from the tad program 
as a result  during fiscal  capital generated total gross revenues of  almost higher than in fiscal direct general and administrative expenses for capital totaled  during fiscal and  had management not elected to make a year end allocation of indirect general and administrative over head costs  net income before taxes would have been approximately  however  due the year end allocation to capital of a share of the company s indirect general and administrative costs in the amount of  capital reflected net pre tax income of only  during fiscal  capital generated gross revenues of  over higher than fiscal  with direct general and administrative expenses of  a decrease of over from fiscal as adjusted to include the year end allocation 
for fiscal  capital operations reflected a gross profit of  with net pre tax income of  an increase of more than  from fiscal during fiscal  ended june   capital generated gross revenues of  over higher that fiscal  with direct general and administrative expenses of  an increase of over fiscal the dramatic increase in both gross revenues and general and administrative expenses during fiscal were the direct result of management s aggressive expansion of its marketing efforts for its tad program during fiscal  which included the opening of two regional sales and marketing offices 
for fiscal  capital s operations reflected a gross of  up more than from fiscal  with net pre tax income of  up more than over fiscal

the international trade division 
during fiscal  the company s four principal overseas markets continued to be i the middle east  ii south america iii europe including eastern europe and iv the pacific rim 
during fiscal  the company showed increased revenues in all four of these primary markets 
the most significant increase occurred in the european area where sales increased almost from fiscal due principally to an increase in demand for computers in eastern europe and the continued increased sales of bard air conditioning units for the tele communications industry in europe 
the company also posted increases of in its south american market  over in its middle east market and in the far east 
the most significant increase in any single market occurred in the united states  due to the substantial increase in revenues earned by capital  where total us sales increased by approximately over fiscal the following table illustrates the company s gross revenues by market segment during the past four fiscal years market segment amount of revenues for fiscal year by area middle east     south america     europe     far east     united states     all others     see financial statements note foreign and domestic operations and export sales 
management plans to utilize current cash on hand in connection with its international trading operations principally for i general working capital reserves to meet any extraordinary or unexpected expenses  ii and to collateralize interim financing  if required  in connection with actrade s export operations 
management has  in many cases  utilized assignments of letters of credit from its overseas buyers in payment for products from american manufacturers 
although this procedure has been acceptable to most suppliers  with respect to new suppliers or for small purchase orders  this assignment procedure may not be acceptable and the company may be required to utilize available cash 
to date  it has not been necessary to use available cash for this purpose and management does not foresee the need for such financing in the future 
see business operations 
during fiscal  ended june   sales by actrade sa totaled  or of the company s total gross revenues  as compared to  or of the company s total gross revenues for fiscal and  or for fiscal the increase in gross revenues for actrade sa resulted primarily from the sale of computer systems and related equipment  which repre sents the culmination of a long term effort to open the developing markets of eastern europe and the former soviet union 
by opening these markets over the past few years  actrade sa has also solidified it s efforts to develop reliable sources for computer systems and hardware 
however  because of the continued volatile economic and political changes in the world  and particularly in eastern europe where actrade sa made a significant portion of its sales during fiscal  it continues to be impossible to accurately project revenues for actrade sa during fiscal however  although no assurances can be given  in management s opinion  revenues are expected to continue at approximately the levels experienced during fiscal and the operations of actrade sa will continue to be an important aspect of the company s overall operations for the foreseeable future 
the most significant factor which continues to impact the growth of actrade sa is the continued economic and political instability among the many new  developing nations of the world 
although no assurances can be given  management believes that  as many of these new and developing countries stabilize their internal political and economic conditions  provided that individual currencies can also be stabilized to permit participation in the international markets  the demand for commercial and consumer products will increase  a factor which is expected to benefit actrade  sa in the future 
another factor which management believes will favor the continued growth of actrade sa has been the improved economic environment in the united states 
with the end of the economic recession  and as domestic sales of products increase  management believes that many american manufacturers will de emphasize the export of their products and will no longer be willing to make the price concessions necessary to be competitive in the international marketplace 
this situation will favor the growth of actrade sa which deals only with foreign made products which are typically less expensive than their american equivalent  and trade financing among these developing countries

discussion of financial condition on a consolidated basis  as of june  the company had total assets of  compared with  at june  and  at june  with total current liabilities of  compared with  and  respectively for june  and 
of the company s assets at june   cash accounted for   represents trade accounts receivable  and  represented tads receivable including  of tads which have been sold to a bank 
the increase in the company s assets at june  was principally due to the increase in cash on hand resulting in significant part from the company s recently completed private placement of its common stock  an increase in trade acceptance drafts receivable bank and trade accounts receivable 
the increase of approximately  in trade accounts receivable at june  was principally due to sales made by actrade and actrade sa during the last quarter of fiscal which were shipped prior to the end of the fiscal year with payment to be made after year end 
as previously indicated see i 
result of operations above  of the company s receivables at june   approximately have been collected as of the date of this report 
despite the increase in trade accounts receivable  management believes that this was caused principally by the increased volume of business by both actrade and actrade sa and the normal variations in company s business and not due to any trend which is expected to have a continuing effect upon operations in the future 
since fiscal  the company has experienced a disproportionate growth rate in its accounts receivable and accounts payable as a percentage of gross revenues due to the nature of the sales made by its air conditioning and refrigeration division and by actrade sa revenues from the air conditioning and refrigeration division are primarily derived from the sale of large commercial and industrial scale units  as opposed to individual home air conditioning units 
consequently  the average invoice amount  as well as the average per item cost  is considerably higher than many of the other products sold by the company resulting in higher cost of goods sold as well as higher accounts receivable and payable 
similarly  the sales revenues generated by actrade sa are from the sale of less expensive foreign made products where the typical gross margins are much lower than for similar american made products 
however  management does not anticipate any additional difficulty in securing required trade financing  if required  as a result of these transaction since virtually all of these sales are based upon the buyers confirmed  irrevocable letters of credit 
at june   the company s total stockholders equity increased to  as compared to  at june  and  at june  the principal source of funds for the company s operations are revenues earned by its operating subsidiaries 
on may   the company commenced a private placement of its common stock pursuant to regulation d promulgated under the securities act of as of june   the end of the fiscal year  the company had received gross proceeds from this private placement of  virtually all of which has been designated by the company for the continued expansion of capital s tad program 
the company terminated this private placement effective the close of business on june  and currently has no additional financing plans for the balance of fiscal during the fiscal year ending june   the company projects no significant additional capital expenditures in connection with any of the company s operations except in connection with the continued expansion of the operations of capital 
although no definitive plans currently exist  management plans to establish a number of additional regional sales and marketing offices in connection with the marketing o capital s tad program 
however  no estimate can be made at this time of the cost of such expansion since no new sites have yet been identified 
at june  the company also had property  less accumulated depreciation  of  compared to  at june  and  at june  and security deposits and loans to employees of  and  respectively 
in connection with the company s relocation during fiscal  it received an month rent abatement from its landlord 
to conform with applicable accounting procedures  the value of this abatement is being amortized over the life of the lease 
at june  the company continued to show  in deferred rent liability 
based upon available cash on hand and expected revenues from operations  management is of the opinion that it will have adequate available funds to meet its anticipated capital expenditures and cash needs for fiscal thereafter  future capital expenditures will be decided based upon operating results and available revenues from operations 
apart from expenses associated with the implementation of capital s operations which cannot be estimated at this time  management projects no significant additional capital expenditures in connection with its operations during the next twelve months 
on a consolidated basis  management believes that operations from its subsidiaries will continue to reflect a profit in fiscal and management expects that revenues will be adequate to meet the company s operating cash needs 
the company plans to draw working capital from cash on hand and operating revenues 
the company s outstanding loans payable to banco portugues do atlantico bpa in the amount of  represent advances against capital s credit line which is fully secured by the proceeds due from tads which have been sold to bpa but which have not yet been collected 
this loan amount is constantly changing based upon a number of factors including the total amount of tads sold to bpa and the extent to which capital needs to utilize this credit facility 
as of the date of this report  the company has a total credit facility of million  in the aggregate  with bpa 
during june   capital secured an additional credit facility  similar to the one it has with bpa  from summit bank  new jersey  in the amount of million 
this facility will be available to finance the continued purchase of tads by capital from its customers in much the same manner as the bpa facility 
consequently  the payment of these outstanding loans is not expected to have an impact upon the company s liquidity 
iv 
trends affecting liquidity  capital resources and operations over the years  management has observed a substantial increase in demand for american made products 
in management s opinion  this is due to a renewed confidence in the quality of american products and the relative weakness in recent years of the us dollar as compared to other major foreign currencies 
this formed the basis of the company s operating philosophy since and  in management s opinion  continues to favor growth over the foreseeable future 
combined with recent changes in world political structures  management believes the demand for american products will continue to increase at least in the foreseeable future 
over the past decade  economic conditions in the united states have caused many american manufacturers to seek new markets for their products and  in particular  to turn to foreign markets to boost domestic sales 
management believes this trend  coupled with renewed demand for american products and improved buying power of foreign currencies  has been beneficial to the company and has been a major factor in its growth over the past four years 
this trend  although expected to continue for the foreseeable future  is now being affected by a number of other factors which could adversely affect future growth rates for the company s present operations 
however  recently management has observed that  with the collapse of traditional political and ideological barriers  the demand for products from all parts of the world has increased perceptibly with many developing and third world nations now looking for products from many different countries 
this has been particularly true of countries with soft currencies ie currencies not readily exchangeable into established currencies such as british pounds  us dollars  etc  which at present are unable to pay for their purchases in us dollars 
management believes that the greatest demand for all kinds of foreign products including those from the us and other industrial nations will come from these new developing third world countries over the next few years 
to meet this changing market demand  the company initiated an expansion of actrade s operations through the establishment of actrade sa  which is intended to compliment current operations by providing foreign sources for products 
as the us economy continues to improve and the dollar strengthens with respect to other currencies  foreign buying power for american products may decrease with foreign buyers looking for comparable  but less expensive  products from other sources 
although it is impossible to predict the extent to which this trend may affect the competitiveness of american products overseas  it is likely that any significant decline in buying power of foreign currencies will have an adverse impact upon actrade s present operations 
although no assurances can be given  management believes that by utilizing its foreign network both to promote new sales of american products and as a source of comparable  less expensive foreign made products  the company will gain the flexibility needed to meet changing product demands over the coming years 
a review of the company s statement of operations shows that the cost of goods sold  as a percentage of total sales  has increased from approximately in fiscal to approximately for fiscal which is slightly lower than the level reached in fiscal 
this increase is the result of three principal factors 
first  the recessionary factors which influenced economic conditions both in the united states and other major industrial nations worldwide over the past decade resulted in a significant increase in competition for a shrinking market 
this resulted in the need to reduce profit margins in order to remain competitive in the world markets 
second  as discussed above  as the company s operations have expanded the nature and mix of the products sold by the company it has also changed from smaller  less expensive products to larger or more expensive products  such as the commercial and industrial air conditioning and refrigeration equipment which made up a significant proportion of the company s total sales since fiscal with such higher priced products  the profit margins are typically less 
finally  the sales by actrade sa have typically consisted of larger orders primarily for computer systems and related equipment from foreign sources  which typically are based upon lower profit margins 
in combination  these factors resulted in a higher percentage cost of sales for the company 
management believes that for the foreseeable future the greatest demand for all kinds of foreign products including those from industrialized nations including the us will continue to come from the new developing and third world countries 
as a result of the elimination of old political and ideological barriers  many other factors now have an effect upon the markets for us products overseas including  among others  lower foreign labor costs and  probably most important  the availability of or lack of trade financing 
in management s opinion  the real key to success in international trading has  at least at present  become the ability to provide trade financing in addition to competitive pricing for products 
to meet this changing market demand  during fiscal the company initiated an expansion of the international trading operations of actrade sa  which was originally formed to compliment current operations by providing foreign sources for products to meet foreign demand 
due to the financial strength of the company  actrade sa has been in a position to fill the financing void created by the dramatic increase in worldwide demand  thereby allowing it to capture a larger share of the current market demand 
the effects of this trend are evident in the company s operating results during the current period 
sales of us products overseas represented by the activities of actrade international corp 
remained relatively stable at  while sales by actrade sa rose dramatically from  during fiscal to  during fiscal apart from proving management s assumption that as sales of us products decrease  sales of foreign products will increase  these results also point out another important factor  to wit  that worldwide demand for all types of products is increasing 
however  management cannot predict whether the extraordinary rise in sales revenues experienced by actrade sa will continue 
at present  while product demand is high and the availability of trade financing is low  actrade sa enjoys a favorable position in the market 
as these factors stabilize and as trade financing becomes more readily available  it is likely that this advantage will decrease 
during fiscal management experienced relative uncertainty as to the potential effect upon sales for actrade s air conditioning and refrigeration division of the recent change in control of hong kong  where a significant portion of this division s sales originate 
however  based upon discussions had with its major customers in the hong kong market  and the sales experience since july   although no assurances can be given  management does not believe that any materially adverse consequences will result from the recent changes in hong kong 
management knows of no other trends reasonably expected to have a material impact upon the company s operations or liquidity in the foreseeable future 
vi inflation 
during the past few years inflation in the united states has been relatively stable which  coupled with the relative strength of foreign currencies discussed above  has had a beneficial effect upon the company s operations in that the products it offers have been competitively priced in relation to comparable foreign made products 
in management s opinion  this is expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
however  should the american economy again experience double digit inflation rates  as was the case in the past  the impact upon prices for american goods could adversely affect the company s ability to effectively compete in its overseas markets
