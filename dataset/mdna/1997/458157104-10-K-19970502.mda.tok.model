the following table shows revenues and gross margins as a percentage of revenues  by business segment  for fiscal and fiscal dollars in millions 
fiscal fiscal gross gross revenues margin revenues margin indirect business   direct business intercompany eliminations totals   intercompany eliminations consist primarily of sales from the indirect business to the direct business 
revenues in the indirect business declined in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of continued competitive pressures throughout the industry primarily due to open sourcing and an additional week of sales in fiscal due to the company s week fiscal year 
the indirect business has experienced a trend of declining sales in recent quarters caused by the company s inability to retain and attract customers resulting from a number of factors 
these factors include fewer product lines offered by the company compared to its larger competitors  a less favorable allocation of constrained products which can command a higher gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal  increased competition  and continued consolidation in the reseller channel 
the increase in revenues by the direct business is due to the inclusion of its operating results for the full year in fiscal compared to only weeks in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of revenues in the indirect business was in fiscal compared to in fiscal exclusive of special inventory related charges recorded in fiscal of approximately million  gross margin percent in fiscal would have been 
the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to a less favorable allocation of constrained products  continued competitive pressures in the industry  increased freight and configuration costs  and the inability to take advantage of purchasing and prepayment discounts due to the company s limited financial resources 
the decrease in gross margin percent for the direct business in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to approximately million of charges recorded in fiscal during fiscal  a major customer of the direct business rental program announced the adoption of a new technology platform resulting in the reassessment by the company of the estimated future revenue stream under this program 
this resulted in an estimated shortfall  of approximately million  in future rental revenue compared to the company s future related lease obligations 
in addition  charges for changes in estimates for inventory reserves million and vendor payables and receivable issues million in the direct business were also recorded 
excluding these charges  the gross margin percent for the direct business for fiscal would have been  reflecting an increase in revenues from the services sector xlconnect of the direct business  which generates a higher gross margin percent 
competitive pressures and their impact on margins are expected to continue in the future 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million of revenues in fiscal compared to million of revenues in fiscal fiscal includes the establishment of reserves for certain accounts receivable in the indirect business of million and write offs for unutilized property and equipment and miscellaneous accruals totaling approximately million 
fiscal includes charges of approximately million consisting primarily of severance costs in connection with a reduction in the company s workforce and a charge related to certain management information systems projects reevaluated and realigned following the acquisition of fnow 
after the elimination of these items  sg a increased approximately million 
this increase is primarily due to an increase of approximately million in the direct business sg a and an increase of million in depreciation in the indirect business  partially offset by savings realized as a result of the workforce reductions which took place in fiscal the increase of the direct business sg a is due to the inclusion of operating costs for the full year in fiscal compared to only weeks in fiscal the increase in depreciation in the indirect business is related to the implementation and enhancement of certain management information systems 
it is anticipated that the workforce reductions and other cost control measures and processes implemented by the company will somewhat mitigate the higher selling  general and administrative costs required to support the operations of the direct business 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company closed the xlsource portion of five branch locations 
four of these branches were acquired from fnow in december and one was acquired from fnow in august as a result of these closures  the company recorded an million charge relating to the allocable portion of goodwill for these locations 
in addition to the goodwill write down  the company also recorded a charge of approximately million to reflect the write off of property and equipment and remaining lease obligations related to these branches 
during the third quarter of fiscal  a decision to adopt open sourcing was made by two of the company s largest vendors 
these vendors products have totaled approximately to of the company s revenues during the past three years 
under open sourcing  franchisees and other resellers are no longer required to purchase product exclusively from the company 
this change and a trend of declining sales  gross margins  earnings and cash flows in the indirect business caused the company to undertake a review of its long lived assets in this business unit 
as a result of this review  which was based on estimated future cash flows of the business  it was determined that certain assets were impaired 
the company determined that the carrying value of its goodwill relative to the indirect business would not be recovered from future operations 
accordingly  this goodwill  amounting to approximately million  was written off as of november  this goodwill was recorded in and with the acquisitions of entre computer centers  inc entre and connecting point of america  inc cpa  respectively 
both entre and cpa had substantial franchise operations when they were acquired 
also  as a result of this review  the company determined that certain technology investments would not be fully recovered from estimated future cash flows 
the company s configuration software  primarily consisting of licenses purchased from a third party in for the use of this system  was written down to its estimated recoverable value 
this write down  approximating million  was due to a continuing trend of expenses exceeding revenues in this portion of the business and the introduction of competitive technology available through the use of the internet 
amortization of intangibles increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a full year of goodwill amortization associated with the fnow acquisition  offset in part by the write off of goodwill in the indirect business discussed above 
investment and other income expense declined in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the use of available cash during fiscal for the payment of cash dividends  capital expenditures and the repayment of fnow s bank and finance company debt following the acquisition in august interest expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of the company s more frequent use of its available financing arrangements for inventory financing and working capital purposes  higher average borrowing rates and the addition of million of long term debt in october the long term debt was reduced to million in october the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was a benefit compared to a benefit for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for fiscal increased approximately compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the revenues generated by the branch locations acquired from fnow in december and the acquisition of the remainder of fnow in august  the addition of new network integrators  an additional week of sales in fiscal due to the company s week fiscal year  and industry growth 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the higher gross margin percent realized by the fnow locations which sell directly to end users  partially offset by continued competitive pricing pressures throughout the industry and special inventory related charges of approximately million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal which represented estimates of inventory obsolescence  damaged merchandise and inventory losses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of revenues in fiscal compared to million of revenues in fiscal during fiscal  the company incurred charges of approximately million as previously discussed 
other causes of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses include operating costs for the fnow locations  costs to service the higher volume of revenues  larger network  new programs and expanded vendor and sku base  and expenses and depreciation relative to the enhancement of existing and implementation of new management information systems 
these increases were offset in part by savings following the elimination of certain peripheral ventures 
in addition  certain costs were incurred in fiscal including a million reserve for litigation and arbitration matters  and costs relating to the implementation of ie ie was a project designed to transform the company to a process driven model 
amortization of intangibles increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to goodwill related to the fnow acquisition 
investment and other income expense declined in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the use of available cash for the payment of cash dividends and share repurchases  the acquisition of certain assets of branch locations from fnow in december  capital expenditures and the repayment of fnow s bank and finance company debt following the acquisition in august interest expense increased from fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of the company s more frequent use of its available financing arrangements for inventory financing and working capital purposes and the addition of million of long term debt in october the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was a benefit compared to a provision for fiscal the effect of non deductible goodwill amortization on the pre tax loss in fiscal was the primary reason for the difference in the effective tax rate 
liquidity outlook during fiscal  both of the company s segments incurred substantial operating losses and such operating losses are continuing 
management has been exploring the company s strategic alternatives  and in connection therewith  on april  the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the stock and related assets and liabilities the indirect business for million  subject to reductions depending on the date of closing and also on revenues during the period through closing 
the purchase price will be payable in cash and assumption of liabilities  based on the indirect business balance sheet at time of closing 
the company will be required  at closing  to pay to ingram any amount by which the estimated assumed liabilities exceed the adjusted purchase price and to fund a million escrow for final settlement of any purchase price adjustments 
it is currently anticipated that the transaction will close during the company s second quarter of fiscal or shortly thereafter 
the company expects  on a preliminary basis  that the sale will result in a pre tax gain of approximately million  subject to reductions depending on the date of closing and revenues during the period through closing 
the consummation of the transaction is subject to the approval of the company s shareholders and required government approvals  as well as other customary conditions 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the sale will be completed 
in the event the transaction is not consummated  and manage ment s operating plans are not achieved  the company s operating results will continue to adversely affect cash flows and liquidity 
the company is continuing to explore its strategic options with respect to the direct business segment  including the implementation of operating plans to improve its results and the possible sale of all or a part of the segment 
there can be no assurance that such results will improve or that any such sale will be completed 
one of the consequences of the company s operating losses was the failure to meet certain of the financial covenants of the company s financing agreement as of february  the company and the finance company have agreed to new covenants which management believes the company will meet throughout fiscal  if the sale of the indirect business is completed 
however  until necessary shareholder and governmental approvals are obtained  the long term portion of the facility will be classified as a current liability in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
notwithstanding such classification  the finance company has agreed that the long term debt  which is not due until october   will not be treated as short term debt for purposes of the financing agreement 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its growth to date from stock offerings  bank and subordinated borrowings  inventory financing and internally generated funds 
the principal uses of its cash have been to fund its accounts receivable and inventory  make acquisitions  repurchase common stock  invest in systems technology  and pay cash dividends 
during fiscal  cash used by operating activities totaled million compared to million of cash used in fiscal the decrease can be attributed primarily to the reduction of accounts receivable  partially offset by increased operating losses and lower inventory levels in fiscal compared to fiscal at february   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at february  this increase is primarily a result of proceeds from the public offering of xlconnect and the sale of preferred stock 
a portion of these proceeds were used to repay million of the long term debt with the balance used for working capital purposes 
working capital was negative million at february  compared to positive working capital of million at february  the reason for the negative working capital is the reclassification of million of long term debt to a current liability  as discussed above in liquidity outlook 
without this reclassification  the company would have had positive working capital of million as of february  based on fiscal year end balances  days sales in accounts receivable were days days in fiscal and inventory turnover was times times in fiscal 
the decrease in inventory turnover is primarily related to significantly lower sales particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal at february   the company had a million financing agreement with a finance company  of which million was available after considering the borrowing base formula and trade payables principally outstanding to a vendor related to the finance company 
the agreement has a rolling eighteen month term and is renewable for six month periods with the consent of the lender 
the facility can be used for inventory financing  equipment financing and working capital purposes 
of the million  million was available to xlconnect and its subsidiaries  which availability was measured against a borrowing base formula relying on xlconnect s separate assets 
xlconnect guaranteed up to a total of million under the agreement 
this facility imposes certain financial covenants relating to working capital  tangible net worth  long term debt to tangible net worth and fixed charge coverage 
as of february   the company was in violation of the working capital and the fixed charge coverage covenants 
the company has obtained a waiver for non compliance with these financial covenants as of february  additionally  the long term debt to tangible net worth and the fixed charge coverage financial covenants were deleted  a current ratio financial covenant was added and the financial covenants for working capital and tangible net worth have been amended for the year ending january  fiscal 
the company believes it will be in compliance with the financial covenants imposed under this agreement during fiscal  if the sale of the indirect business is completed 
the facility has been extended to october  in march  the agreement was further amended to delete the assets of xlconnect and its subsidiaries from the borrowing base  which in effect reduces the amount the company can borrow under this credit facility by million 
in conjunction with the march amendment  xlconnect entered into a separate credit agreement with this lender in the amount of million  which the company has guaranteed 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the board of directors suspended the company s quarterly dividend 
based on the company s expected level of operations  including plans to reduce the operating losses of xlsource  and capital expenditure requirements  management believes that the company s cash  internally generated funds  available financing arrangements and proceeds from the sale of the indirect business  will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal however  if the company is unable to complete the transaction with ingram  or continues to experience losses and negative operating cash flows  the company s vendors could elect to restrict product availability and modify credit terms  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity position 
in such circumstances  there can be no assurance that alternative sources of financing could be obtained 
inflation and seasonality the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity to date 
the company s financial performance does not exhibit significant seasonality  although certain computer product lines and the direct business follow a seasonal pattern with peaks occurring near the end of the calendar year
