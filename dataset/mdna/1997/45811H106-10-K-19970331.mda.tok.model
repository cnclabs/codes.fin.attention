for orders that are considered long term contracts under applicable accounting standards  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
long term contracts include a relatively high engineering content 
for such long term contracts  customers generally are not billed and payment is not received until products are shipped 
revenues recognized on long term contracts in excess of amounts billed to customers are classified as current assets  as these contracts are expected to be completed within one year 
most of the company s international sales are denominated in us dollars  canadian welding sales are denominated in canadian dollars and japanese sales of optical inspection equipment are denominated in yen 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations has historically not been significant 
for additional information on export sales  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements item 
the markets in which the company competes are technologically advanced and highly competitive 
accordingly  the company s continued success requires substantial research and development expenditures 
while developing new products  the company attempts to be cognizant of inventory currently in its possession in order to help mitigate inventory becoming obsolete 
software development expenditures that are not chargeable to specific customer orders are expensed as research and development until technical feasibility is established 
thereafter  such expenditures are capitalized  reflected as other assets at the lower of cost or net realizable value  and amortized over the shorter of the remaining estimated economic life of the related products or five years 
capitalized software development costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
amortization of capitalized software included in cost of sales was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
engineering and development expenditures relating to certain orders are incorporated in the price charged to customers and are reflected in cost of sales 
those costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company expects to continue its commitment to research and development in the future 
management s future expectations and results of operations  and other forward looking statements contained in this document  involve a number of risks and uncertainties

the increase in the sales of resistance welding products resulted principally from continued strong orders from general motors and chrysler to satisfy retooling programs 
the decrease in sales in optical vision products resulted principally from an industry wide drop in the growth of orders for audio cd s and cd rom s which resulted in reductions in and cancellations of orders for cd inspection equipment  particularly in the second half of the year 
cost of sales increased to million from million and as a percent age of net sales decreased to from 
although and percentages are comparative  the cost of sales percentage remains higher than prior years and management s goals 
this results from costs of amortization of software and other fixed costs not being fully absorbed at the sales levels achieved in and marketing expense decreased to million from million and as a percentage of net sales from to 
the decrease resulted from better control of marketing costs  particularly the more effective integration of the aid and integral vision sales forces in the current year 
general and administrative expense decreased to million from million and as a percentage of net sales from to 
the decrease resulted from cost savings following the closing of the former aid facility in toledo early in and better consolidation of general and administrative costs related to integral vision in the uk 
research and development costs increased to million from million and as a percentage of net sales from to 
the increase principally represents increased expenditures related to development of visionblox and dvd and cd r technologies 
page patent litigation costs and excess product quality  warranty and other costs represent expenses that were concluded as of december  interest expense increased to million from 
million and as a percentage of net sales to from

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company s sales and operating results have varied substantially from quarter to quarter 
net sales and earnings are typically lower in the fourth and first quarters 
the most significant factors affecting these fluctuations are the seasonal buying patterns of the company s customers 
the principal customers for the company s resistance welding control products traditionally make purchases in connection with re tooling for new automobile body styles and tend to purchase the company s equipment in the second and third quarters 
the end users of the company s optical inspection products typically add manufacturing capacity in the second and third quarters in anticipation of higher production requirements in the fourth quarter 
the company expects its net sales and earnings to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had a revolving note payable to bank due august   with a maximum balance of million 
in february   following negotiations with the bank  the company restructured its bank obligation as follows revolving note payable to bank  with interest at the bank s prime rate  plus  due august  note payable to bank  with interest at the bank s prime rate  plus  due million july  and million december  million demand note payable to bank  with interest at the bank s prime rate  plus  guaranteed by a stockholder 
the total of these obligations is limited to million decreasing to million on july  with availability of the revolving note based upon levels of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
million was borrowed on the line as of december  substantially all of the company s assets are pledged in support of these obligations and the mortgage notes payable 
the agreement with the bank includes tangible net worth covenants and ratios at levels which the company believes can be maintained over the life of the agreement 
in  the company used proceeds from long term borrowings to fund additions to capitalized software and property and equipment 
despite the operating loss  actual cash used in operations was minimal 
no significant commitments for capital expenditures existed as of december  the company expects to capitalize approximately million of software development costs in and has no other plans for significant capital expenditures 
although the company believes that current financial resources together with cash generated from operations are adequate to meet cash needs through  it expects to issue subordinated debt in the first six months of that will be used to refinance the demand note and support working capital requirements
