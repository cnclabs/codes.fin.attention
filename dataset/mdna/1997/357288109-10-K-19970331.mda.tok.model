item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including those set forth elsewhere in this form k 
general fremont general corporation is engaged domestically in select insurance and financial services businesses 
fremont general s insurance business includes one of the largest underwriters of workers compensation insurance in the nation 
the company also provides medical malpractice insurance 
fremont general s financial services business includes commercial real estate lending  residential real estate lending  commercial finance and premium financing 
the company s total assets as of december  were billion  with pre tax earnings of million 
the primary operating strategy of the company is to build upon its core business units through acquisition opportunities and new business development 
the company s secondary strategy is to achieve income balance and geographic diversity among its business units in order to limit the exposure of the company to industry  market and regional concentrations 
the company s stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol fmt nyse fmt 
the company began its workers compensation insurance operations in and continues to derive the majority of its revenues from this business 
the company s workers compensation insurance business has grown through internal expansion  as well as through the acquisition of other workers compensation insurance companies 
on february   the company completed the acquisition of all outstanding stock of casualty insurance company casualty and its wholly owned subsidiary workers compensation indemnity company of california wcic from the buckeye union insurance company 
casualty underwrites workers compensation insurance primarily in illinois and several other mid western states 
casualty currently is the largest underwriter of workers compensation insurance in illinois and has provided the company with a significant presence in the mid western region 
the casualty acquisition has provided geographic diversity within the company s workers compensation insurance business and approximately of the company s revenues from workers compensation insurance premiums were generated in the mid west region  with the remaining emanating from the west region  primarily in california 
the company believes this geographic diversity mitigates potential fluctuations in earnings from cyclical downturns in various regional economies 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to the acquisition of casualty 
in july  california enacted legislation to reform the workers compensation insurance system and to  among other things  adopt an open rating system through the repeal of the minimum rate law effective january  the repeal of the minimum rate law resulted in lower premiums and lower profitability on the company s california workers compensation insurance policies in and due to increased price competition 
see results of operations property and casualty insurance operations premiums 
the company s acquisition of casualty  with policies written primarily outside of california  lessened the impact of the repeal of the minimum rate law by providing geographic diversity  which mitigates the impact of economic and regulatory changes within a regional marketplace 
in illinois  where casualty underwrites the majority of its workers compensation insurance premiums  price competition continues to impact workers compensation companies due in part to overall average decreases in advisory premium rates of and which became effective january  and  respectively 
although insurance companies are not required to adopt such advisory premium rates  companies in illinois generally follow such rates

in an effort to provide a clearer understanding of the company s financial services business segment  the company has consolidated the real estate lending operations of fremont investment loan  a california thrift and loan  and the commercial finance operations of fremont financial corporation  under a newly formed company  fremont general credit corporation fgcc 
at december   fgcc had assets of approximately billion  and reported pre tax income of million 
the company s real estate lending operations  which began in through the acquisition of a california thrift and loan  now serves more than  customers through branch offices 
the thrift and loan operations are primarily engaged in commercial and residential real estate lending 
for commercial real estate loans  principal amounts primarily range between million to million and for residential real estate loans  principal amounts are generally below  the company s operating strategy is to pursue growth of the loan portfolio through origination of new loans and acquisition of loan portfolios that meet its underwriting guidelines applied to origination of new loans 
assets of the real estate lending operation grew from million at the end of to billion at the end of  due primarily to increased loan originations and to the purchase of loan portfolios from other financial institutions 
see item business financial services operations real estate lending 
the ability of the company to continue to originate loans  and of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  may be impaired by adverse changes in local or regional economic conditions which affect such areas or by adverse changes in the real estate market in those areas 
such events could also significantly impair the value of the underlying collateral 
if the company s collateral were to prove inadequate  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
the commercial finance operation of fgcc provides working capital loans  primarily secured by accounts receivable and inventory  to small and middle market companies on a nationwide basis 
additionally  insurance premium financing is provided and is collateralized by security interests in return premiums 
the total commercial finance loan portfolio grew from million at december  to million at december  this growth has been achieved primarily through development of the customer base through loan originations and through participation in syndicated loan transactions 
see item business financial service operations commercial finance 
the lending market has become increasingly competitive for small to middle market commercial borrowers 
as a result  fgcc has experienced decreasing yields on its commercial finance loans 
between and  the company discontinued its domestic treaty reinsurance business  its other primary and excess property and casualty insurance operations and the underwriting of all remaining assumed reinsurance 
in  a single management group was put in charge of all discontinued operations  and it is the intention of the company to complete the liquidation of these operations by the commutation of liabilities and as claims are paid

revenues were lower in as compared to  due principally to lower workers compensation insurance premiums and lower life insurance revenues in the financial services segment 
the lower workers compensation insurance premiums are due primarily to lower premiums earned in california and  to a lesser extent  lower premiums earned in illinois 
see property and casualty insurance operations premiums 
the lower life insurance revenues in the financial services segment are due to certain reinsurance and assumption agreements with a reinsurer which became effective december  and january  and resulted in the sale of substantially all of the company s life insurance operations 
see financial services

the financial services business segment posted increases of and in income before taxes for and  respectively 
although income before taxes was relatively flat in as compared to  the results in were negatively impacted by the establishment of a specific loan loss associated with one loan in the commercial finance loan portfolio 
also impacting the financial services segment in is the reduction in life insurance operations resulting from certain reinsurance and assumption agreements entered into between the company and a reinsurer which became effective december  and january  these transactions essentially resulted in the sale of the life insurance operations 
see financial services 
the increase in income before taxes of in is consistent with the increase in financial services revenues and is due primarily to the significant growth in the average loan portfolio in to billion from billion in the average loan portfolio further grew to billion in this segment  which consists principally of real estate lending  commercial finance and premium finance  recorded income before taxes of million  million and million for  and  respectively

the corporate loss before income taxes was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in the corporate loss before taxes in as compared to was due principally to increased interest expense and increased administrative expenses 
the increase in interest expense is mainly due to additional debt incurred in the acquisition of casualty  as well as to accrued dividends in connection with a public offering on march  of million of trust originated preferred securities sm the preferred securities sold by a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the accrued dividends on the preferred securities have been classified in the consolidated statements of income as interest expense 
see note j of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in the corporate loss before taxes in over was due primarily to increased interest expense and decreased investment income 
the increase in interest expense is due primarily to additional debt incurred in the acquisition of casualty  along with modest increases in administrative expenses 
income tax expense of million  million and million for  and  respectively  represents an effective tax rate of each year on pretax income of million  million and million for the corresponding periods 
the company s effective tax rates for all years presented are lower than the enacted federal income tax rate of  due primarily to tax exempt investment income which reduces the company s taxable income 
property and casualty insurance operations the following table represents information with respect to the company s property and casualty insurance operations year ended december  thousands of dollars revenues    expenses    income before taxes    revenues from the property and casualty insurance operations consist primarily of workers compensation insurance premiums earned  medical malpractice premiums earned and net investment income 
expenses consist primarily of loss and loss adjustment expenses  policy acquisition costs  other operating costs and expenses and  for the year ended december   dividends to policyholders 
premiums 
premiums earned from the company s workers compensation insurance operations were million for  as compared to million and million for and  respectively 
premiums were significantly lower in due primarily to lower premiums earned in california and to a lesser extent lower premiums earned in illinois 
premiums were significantly higher in as compared to  due primarily to the acquisition of casualty  partially offset by lower premiums earned in california 
for the year ended december   the company s workers compensation insurance premiums earned in its western region  consisting primarily of california  accounted for million  or of the company s total workers compensation insurance premiums earned for such period  representing decreases of million and million from west region premiums earned in and  respectively 
these decreases are due primarily to the increased price competition resulting from california s adoption of an open rating system and the repeal of the minimum rate law 
see workers compensation regulation 
this increased price competition has led to i lower premium rates and ii a lower average policy size due to the company s shift in focus to smaller employers 
additionally  an increase in in non renewing policies also contributed to the lower premium volume in california 
the increase in non renewing policies occurs as a result of certain premium prices falling below required minimum pricing pursuant to the company s underwriting standards 
for the year ended december   the company s workers compensation insurance premiums earned in its mid western region  consisting primarily of illinois  accounted for million  or of the company s total workers compensation insurance premiums earned 
price competition in illinois has impacted the company s results of operations and will continue to affect such results  due in part to overall average decreases in advisory premium rates of and that became effective january  and  respectively  and which workers compensation insurance companies in illinois tend to follow 
net investment income 
net investment income within the property and casualty insurance operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
significantly higher invested assets  due primarily to the acquisition of casualty  resulted in increased investment income in and as compared to see item business investment portfolio 
loss and loss adjustment expense 
workers compensation loss and loss adjustment expenses lae were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition  the ratio of these losses and lae to workers compensation insurance premiums earned was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the dollar amount of incurred loss and lae in as compared to is due principally to lower claim frequency and severity in the company s mid west region and a lower level of incurred losses and lae in the company s west region resulting from lower insurance premiums earned on california policies which resulted from increased competition 
see premiums 
the increase in incurred loss and lae in as compared to is due primarily to the acquisition of casualty  partially offset by lower incurred loss and lae in california 
additionally  the increase in the loss and lae ratio in as compared to is partially due to lower premiums on california policies which resulted from increased competition in the decrease in california premiums was greater than the decrease in california incurred loss and lae  thereby resulting in a higher loss and lae ratio 
the negative impact on the company s profitability resulting from the higher loss and lae ratio has been mitigated to an extent by the elimination of dividends accrued on california workers compensation business beginning in the dividend elimination occurred as substantially all of the workers compensation policies written beginning in were non participating 
this type of policy is not eligible for dividend consideration 
see dividends to policyholders and item business insurance operations loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
the company regularly reviews its reserving techniques  overall reserve position and reinsurance 
in light of present facts and current legal interpretations  management believes that adequate provisions have been made for loss reserves 
in making this determination  management has considered its claims experience to date  loss development history for prior accident years and estimates of future trends of claims frequency and severity 
however  establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and there can be no certainty that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
subsequent actual experience has resulted and could result in loss reserves being too high or too low 
future loss development could require reserves for prior periods to be increased  which would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
policy acquisition costs and other operating costs and expenses 
the ratio of policy acquisition costs and other operating costs and expenses to premiums earned is referred to as the expense ratio  which was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in this ratio in  as compared to  was due primarily to higher operating costs and expenses  partially offset by lower agents commission costs 
the increase in this ratio in  as compared to  was due primarily to higher agents commission costs 
dividends to policyholders 
in and there were no dividends accrued 
this is compared to million accrued in the ratio of dividends accrued to workers compensation insurance premiums earned therefore decreased to in and from in the significant decrease in dividends accrued is due in part to a change in the type of workers compensation insurance policy written on and after january  in  the company s workers compensation insurance policies  both in california and those underwritten by casualty  were predominately written as non participating  which does not include provisions for dividend consideration 
in and prior  the company s policies were predominately written as participating  thereby obligating the company to consider the payment of dividends 
this shift in policy type is due primarily to the increased competition in the california market which has resulted from the repeal of the minimum rate law  effective january  the company anticipates that this shift to non participating policies will continue and be a characteristic element of the competitive environment established by the july california legislation 
see workers compensation regulation 
variability of operating results 
the company s profitability can be affected significantly by many factors including competition  the severity and frequency of claims  interest rates  regulations  court decisions  the judicial climate  and general economic conditions and trends  all of which are outside of the company s control 
these factors have contributed  and in the future could contribute  to significant variation of results of operations in different aspects of the company s business from quarter to quarter and year to year 
with respect to the workers compensation insurance business  changes in economic conditions can lead to reduced premium levels due to lower payrolls as well as increased claims due to the tendency of workers who are laid off to submit workers compensation claims 
legislative and regulatory changes can also contribute to variable operating results for workers compensation insurance businesses 
for example  in  the company experienced the negative impact of lower premiums and lower profitability on the company s california workers compensation business due to increased price competition resulting from legislation enacted in california in july which  among other things  repealed the minimum rate law effective january  see workers compensation regulation 
also  the establishment of appropriate reserves necessarily involves estimates  and reserve adjustments have caused significant fluctuations in operating results from year to year 
workers compensation regulation 
illinois began operating under an open rating system in and california began operating under such a system effective january  in an open rating system  workers compensation companies are provided with advisory premium rates by job classification and each insurance company determines its own rates based in part upon its particular operating and loss costs 
although insurance companies are not required to adopt such advisory premium rates  companies in illinois generally follow such rates 
this characteristic has resulted in price competition in illinois  where overall average decreases in advisory premium rates of and became effective january  and  respectively 
however  insurance companies in california have  since the adoption of an open rating system  generally set their premium rates below such advisory premium rates 
before january   california operated under a minimum rate law  whereby premium rates established by the california department of insurance were the minimum rates which could be charged by an insurance carrier 
in july  california enacted legislation to reform the workers compensation insurance system and to  among other things  repeal the minimum rate law effective january  this repeal resulted in lower premiums and lower profitability in the company s california workers compensation insurance business due to increased price competition 
the company s acquisition of casualty  with policies written primarily outside of california  lessened the impact of the repeal of the minimum rate law by providing geographic diversity  which mitigates the impact of economic and regulatory changes within a regional marketplace

financial services the financial services operations of fgcc are principally engaged in commercial and residential real estate lending  commercial finance and premium financing 
the company also has small life insurance operations included in this segment which was substantially sold in revenues consist principally of interest income and  to a lesser extent  life insurance premiums  fees and other income 
the following table presents information with respect to the company s financial services operations year ended december  thousands of dollars revenues    expenses    income before taxes    revenues decreased in  due primarily to lower life insurance revenues 
these lower life insurance revenues resulted from certain reinsurance and assumption agreements which the company entered into on december  and january   primarily with one reinsurer  whereby assets and liabilities related to certain life and annuity insurance policies  primarily universal life and investment type contracts and credit life and accident and health  were ceded to the reinsurer 
the reinsurance agreements are part of several other agreements which have collectively resulted in a substantial reduction in the company s life insurance operations 
the effect on income before taxes and net income from these agreements was not material 
see note f of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues increased in  due primarily to greater loan interest and fee revenue attributable to the significant growth in the average loan portfolios of the real estate lending and commercial finance operations to billion in from billion in the average loan portfolio further grew to billion in income before taxes in the financial services operations was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
income before taxes was relatively flat in the financial services segment for as compared to the company realized higher income before taxes in the real estate lending operation as lower loan loss experience resulted in a lower provision for loan losses 
this was offset substantially by lower income in the commercial finance operation due primarily to a specific loan loss associated with one loan in the commercial finance loan portfolio 
additionally  lower income was earned in the life insurance operation due to certain reinsurance agreements which became effective on december  and january  and which resulted in a substantial reduction in the company s life insurance operations in the increase in income before taxes in as compared to is due primarily to the significant growth in the average loan portfolios  offset partially by increases in the provision for loan losses and other expenses

the margin between the company s interest income and cost of funds decreased in as compared to  due primarily to an increase in lower yielding cash equivalents in the real estate lending operation and a decrease in net margins in the commercial finance operation resulting from an increase in the credit quality of the commercial loan portfolio  as well as to increased competition 
these conditions affecting the commercial finance operation also existed in which resulted in net yields decreasing in as compared to additionally  net yields decreased in due to changes in the mix of loans in the real estate lending operation 
the change in portfolio mix occurred under a corporate strategy which began in  to shift away from high rate  high risk loans secured by personal property or junior liens on real estate  to lower yielding commercial and residential first trust deed real estate loans 
the lower yields on the commercial and residential real estate portfolios are compensated for by the improved underlying collateral and by the improved lien position on the collateral 
interest rate sensitivity data for the company s financial services operations as of december  is presented in the table below

the decrease in non accrual loans in the commercial finance lending operation is primarily due to one loan in the commercial finance portfolio classified as non accrual at december  and subsequently charged off in non performing assets remained relatively stable at december  as compared to december  the lower provision for loan losses in as compared to is due primarily to improved loan loss experience in the real estate lending operation  offset partially by an additional specific loan loss in the commercial finance operation associated with one loan in the commercial finance portfolio

net cash provided by used in operating activities of continuing operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by used in operating activities decreased in as compared to due primarily to a decrease in claims and policy liabilities  a lower amortization of policy acquisition costs  higher discount amortization on fixed maturity investments  and a decrease in other liabilities due primarily to the settlement of accrued operating costs 
these conditions were partially offset by higher net income  lower policy acquisition costs deferred  higher depreciation and amortization  and an increase in the change in accrued investment income 
the decrease in claims and policy liabilities  the lower amortization of policy acquisition costs  and the lower policy acquisition costs deferred resulted primarily from lower premium volume in the company s workers compensation insurance business 
the higher discount amortization on fixed maturity investments is due mainly to an acceleration of discount amortization on certain mortgage backed securities during the higher depreciation and amortization in is due primarily to amortization on certain deferred stock based compensation programs awarded in see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the significant increase in the change in accrued investment income in as compared to is due primarily to the acquisition of casualty which resulted in a significant increase in the accrual of investment income for and thereby negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities in net cash provided by used in operating activities decreased in over due primarily to the following items i a smaller net decrease in agents balances and reinsurance recoverables  ii the previously mentioned increase in accrued investment income  iii a greater decrease in claims and policy liabilities  iv and higher policy acquisition costs deferred  net of amortization 
these conditions were partially offset by higher net income  a net increase in other liabilities  net of other assets and a significant increase in the provision for deferred income taxes 
the decreases in agents balances and claims and policy liabilities are primarily due to lower premium volume in the company s california workers compensation insurance business 
higher policy acquisition costs deferred are due primarily to increases in annuity contract receipts in the company s life insurance operation 
see note f of notes to consolidated financial statements
