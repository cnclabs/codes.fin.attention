item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview  forward looking statements and certain factors that may impact future results the company commenced shipments of its digital audio workstation  the sonicstudio  in the first calendar quarter of sales of the sonicstudio product line including sonic developed software and sonic manufactured hardware  third party developed software and hardware peripheral devices and associated maintenance fees  together with sales of sonic medianet accounted for virtually all of the company s net revenue during the six fiscal years ended march   and approximately half of the company s net revenue during the fiscal year ended march  the company s future success will depend in part on sales of the sonicstudio to audio professionals 
the company believes there is little growth in the overall market for professional audio equipment 
sales of products by sonic have depended upon the substitution of digital audio workstations for other existing technologies  and sonic s ability to increase sales will continue to depend in large part on the continued substitution of digital audio workstations for other technologies 
in june   the company began shipments of its dvd creator system 
the company s future success will also depend in large part on sales of the dvd creator system which accounted for approximately half of the company s net revenue in the fiscal year ended march sonicstudio is an integrated assembly of software  signal processing cards and other sonic manufactured hardware  as well as peripheral devices such as disk drives and cd printers which are purchased as complete or largely complete devices from other manufacturers 
sonicstudio is integrated with a macintosh computer which is not typically provided by the company 
the company s gross margin on the software and sonic manufactured hardware is generally over  and the gross margin on hardware peripheral devices is generally less than 
as a result  overall gross margin from period to period will vary depending on the volume of peripheral devices relative to sonic developed software and sonic manufactured hardware included in net revenue 
during fiscal year  the company s gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of the various extra costs associated with the problems experienced in executing a transition to a sonicstudio product line including the usp card  as discussed in ultrasonic processor product transition  transition difficulties beginning on page in february of  the company began shipments of sonic medianet  a high performance  fully distributed networking system designed specifically to handle digital audio  digital video  high resolution graphics and other multimedia data types  for use with applications other than sonicstudio 
in the fiscal year ended march   sonic medianet revenues constituted approximately of company revenues 
of total sonic medianet sales during fiscal  approximately were for use with applications other than sonicstudio 
sonic medianet allows users to share digital audio and other multimedia data types efficiently among multiple workers in a facility 
sonic medianet consists of specialized network adapter plug in cards installed in the nubus or pci bus of an apple macintosh computer 
sonic medianet combines fddi or cddi fiber based or copper based technology with a special file system running on scsi disks attached directly to the network cards 
this file system  called the media optimized file system  addresses the needs of multimedia applications 
in addition to its use in digital audio applications  sonic medianet has uses in other areas of the computer industry whenever work groups wish to collaborate on applications which require high  sustained rates of data transfer  a high degree of compatibility with conventional computing systems and some degree of guaranteed bandwidth 
in the last quarter of fiscal  the company became aware of competitive announcements which would significantly reduce demand for sonic medianet in the prepress industry 
based on these announcements  the company began preparing for transitioning the current sonic medianet product  which included various charges to the fiscal year results of operations  as discussed in early sonic medianet technology transition difficulties beginning on page it is the company s intention to introduce in fiscal a second generation sonic medianet product line  incorporating newer networking technologies and supporting increased performance levels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing such a product line  or that  if successfully developed  such a second generation product line will be attractive to customers when compared to other network product offerings 
further  transition between the first generation and second generation product lines may present a number of difficulties for the company including slow sales or returns of dealer stocks of the first generation product 
such difficulties could have an adverse affect on revenues in future periods 
in the fall of  apple computer discontinued sales of macintosh computers with nubus interfaces  transitioning to a product line based exclusively on the pci bus 
while compatible equipment suppliers clone makers have continued to supply nubus computers until recently  they also have signaled their intention to transition to product lines based exclusively on the pci bus 
shortly before the end of the fiscal year  the company began shipping sonic medianet cards compatible with the pci bus 
during june   the company began shipping the first installation phase of the dvd creator system for dvd encoding and premastering including the audio and authoring subsystems 
during the quarter ended september   the company began shipping the video subsystem of the dvd creator system 
for the fiscal year ended march   dvd creator systems constituted approximately of the company s net revenue 
the company s quarterly operating results vary significantly depending on the timing of new product introductions and enhancements by the company and its competitors and on the volume and timing of orders  which are difficult to forecast 
customers generally order on an as needed basis  and the company normally ships products within one week after receipt of an order 
the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
a disproportionate percentage of the company s quarterly net revenue is typically generated in the last few weeks of the quarter 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is relatively fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
as a result  if revenue generated in the last few weeks of a quarter do not meet with the company s forecast  operating results may be materially adversely affected 
the company capitalizes a portion of its software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
such costs are amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated economic life of the product  which is generally three years
