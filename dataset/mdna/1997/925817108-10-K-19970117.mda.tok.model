comparable consolidated same store sales decreased  reflecting a increase for village inn and a decrease for bakers square 
village inn s comparable sales increase was due primarily to increased average customer expenditures from menu mix changes coupled with a modest customer count increase 
bakers square s comparable sales decrease was due primarily to lower customer counts 
a menu price decrease for bakers square taken in the middle of was offset by the addition of higher priced manager s daily specials in september and other menu changes in consolidated restaurant sales decreased in versus the company operated approximately fewer restaurants in compared to due to restaurant closures 
a comparable same store sales decline of also contributed to the overall decrease in sales 
the bakers square division registered the majority of the decrease which was affected by a menu price reduction put into place in the middle of  which decreased average customer expenditures by approximately 
this action of reducing prices was taken to reverse a four year decline in customer counts in that division 
compared to the prior year  same store customer counts for bakers square decreased in prior to the price reduction  but only decreased thereafter 
consolidated restaurant operating profit increased in versus bakers square accounted for the majority of the improvement as a result of programs to control waste and gain efficiencies 
also  more pronounced costs of programs to improve customer counts in  reduced advertising costs  and the closure of unprofitable locations contributed to the improvement 
village inn s restaurant operating profit improved due largely to reduced food and advertising costs 
consolidated restaurant operating profit decreased in versus bakers square s restaurant operating profit decreased significantly due to the menu price reductions  lower comparable sales in relationship to fixed costs  and investments in food  labor and certain other restaurant related items in order to improve customer counts 
village inn s restaurant operating results were essentially unchanged from the prior year  but improved as a percentage of sales 
the closure of unprofitable restaurants and reduced advertising and insurance costs were largely offset by higher labor costs from increased staffing 
angel s  the company s experimental concept  recorded a restaurant operating loss in due to preopening costs and a higher than expected cost structure 
franchise income decreased in versus due to higher costs to resume growth in that group 
franchise income increased in versus due to lower administrative costs 
general and administrative expense decreased in versus due to cost control measures  but increased to of revenues from in general and administrative expense decreased in compared to as the result of administrative office consolidations  staff reductions  reduced incentive and legal expenses and a  sign up bonus for the company s president paid in interest expense increased in versus due to increased average levels of borrowing partially offset by reduced capital lease interest 
other income expense in included  of income related to settlement of litigation against certain of the company s insurance carriers 
in  the company recorded a  asset disposal charge related to its decision to close almost all of its angel s diner restaurants after determining that its strategy of using that concept to invigorate underperforming restaurants was not economically feasible 
the charge reduced the carrying values of related assets to net realizable value and provided for closure and carrying costs 
in  the company recorded a  charge related primarily to a plan to close and dispose of underperforming restaurants and discontinue a portion of the company s manufacturing and distribution activities 
also  included were charges to impair the carrying values on four properties and to accrue for administrative restructuring costs 
as of october   all of the restaurants scheduled for disposition had been closed 
operating results for the closed restaurants for the past three fiscal years were as follows bakers square sales    restaurant operating profit loss    village inn sales    restaurant operating profit loss    angel s sales    restaurant operating profit loss    total sales    restaurant operating profit loss    in  the company discontinued internal warehousing and distribution of grocery products for its restaurants 
the company does not anticipate significant changes in delivered product costs as a result of the change 
also  the company closed its bakery facility in phoenix  arizona in and its bakery facilities in denver  colorado and orlando  florida in the effective income tax rates used for financial reporting were in  in and in the higher rates in and were primarily due to the greater impact of tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of funds is cash provided by operations 
cash flow from operations increased in due primarily to higher operating income 
the company s working capital is generally in a deficit position because  like most restaurant businesses  substantially all sales are for cash  while credit is received from trade suppliers 
furthermore  the company has not maintained large excess cash balances  but rather has utilized available cash for capital spending  repayment of borrowings or the repurchase of its common stock 
the company supplements cash provided by operations with bank borrowings and occasional lease financing 
during fiscal  the company reduced its outstanding debt borrowings by  at october   the company had  of outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facility  with approximately  available for additional direct advances 
at october   the company had properties remaining which it was trying to dispose of 
seven of these properties were owned in fee and the rest were leased 
the company intends to sell the fee properties over the next year and million of proceeds are expected to be realized from their sale 
the company does not anticipate significant proceeds from the disposition of the leased properties 
it is expected that the majority of the leased properties will be disposed of through sublease over the next twelve to sixteen months 
cash carrying costs of approximately million are expected to be incurred over that period 
the company expects to sublease five of the properties at rentals lower than the company s obligations under the prime leases 
those sublease losses will be incurred over the remaining years of the leases and the company does not anticipate that the losses will materially affect the company s liquidity 
in and   shares of the company s common stock were repurchased for  under authorizations approved by the board of directors 
at october   authorization to repurchase an additional  common shares was available 
future purchases with respect to this authorization may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and will be dependent upon various business and financial considerations 
capital expenditures in totaled  and consisted of  for improvements to existing restaurants   for the purchase of equipment previously leased  and  for other support related projects 
capital expenditures of  are expected for no new restaurants are planned during cash flow from operations  funds available under a bank credit facility  or other financing sources are expected to be adequate for planned capital projects and any repurchases of common stock authorized by the board 
at october   the company had  of net deferred tax assets  the majority of which relates to federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling  the company has established a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty that the full amount of the operating loss carryforwards will be applied against future taxable income 
while a continuation of the company s taxable income level is not sufficient to realize the portion of the net deferred tax asset related to the operating loss carryforwards before the expiration periods  the company feels that its operating results are not indicative of future performance 
historically  the company had taxable income in excess of the amount necessary for realization and believes it will do so again in future years 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
cumulative taxable income of approximately  for fiscal years through will be necessary to realize net deferred tax assets of approximately  before expiration for a majority of the net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
management outlook federal law was recently enacted that raised the hourly minimum wage by cents to on october   and will raise it again by another cents to on september  however  the legislation freezes the wages of tipped employees to an hour assuming the difference is earned in tip income 
the tipped wage is higher in certain states in which the company operates that either do not allow tip credit or provide for a smaller tip credit than allowed under federal law 
also  the minimum wage in california is scheduled to increase to per hour in march and to per hour in march  and a number of other states have indicated that they are considering raising their minimum wage rate above the federal level 
the company expects an annual impact from the federal minimum wage increase of approximately million  prior to the benefits of the operational efficiencies that are being implemented to offset this increase 
raising menu prices is not contemplated at this time 
the mid scale segment of the restaurant industry remains extremely competitive 
the company has discontinued opening new restaurants until existing operations improve 
improvements in future operating performance will be primarily dependent upon the company s ability to increase comparable sales  especially given the significant profit impact associated with incremental sales at existing restaurants 
cost controls will also play a significant factor in future profit growth 
in addition  numerous external factors could have a significant impact on future performance  including but not limited to food commodity costs  labor availability  site availability  the economy  the weather and government initiatives such as minimum wage rates  mandated benefits and taxes 
historically  the company has mitigated the effects of inflation through cost controls and periodic price increases 
management believes it will be able to minimize the effects of future inflation through similar measures  although such price increases will be subject to competitive constraints and other business considerations
