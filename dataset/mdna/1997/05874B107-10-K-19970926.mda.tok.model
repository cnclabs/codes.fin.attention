customer financing management believes that customer financing terms and leasing have become an increasingly important competitive factor for the gaming equipment and systems and wall machine and amusement games business units  respectively 
competitive conditions sometimes require gaming equipment and systems to grant extended payment terms on gaming machines systems and other gaming equipment  especially for sales in emerging markets 
while these financings are normally collateralized by such equipment  the resale value of the collateral in the event of default may be less than the amount financed

it is possible that one or more customers whose obligation has been guaranteed by gaming equipment and systems may be unable to make payments as such amounts become due 
in such event  gaming equipment and systems may become responsible for repayment of at least a portion of such amounts over the term of the receivables 
accordingly  the company will have greater exposure to the financial condition of its customers in emerging markets than has historically been the case in established markets like nevada and atlantic city

competition gaming equipment and systems 
the market for gaming machines is extremely competitive  and there are a number of established  well financed and well known companies producing machines that compete with each of gaming s product lines in each of gaming s markets 
the domestic market for gaming machines is dominated by a single competitor  international game technology igt  with a number of smaller competitors in the field 
in addition  certain technology oriented companies have recently entered or may enter the gaming machine market 
management believes that some of these competitors have greater capital resources than the company 
competition among gaming machine manufacturers  particularly with respect to sales of gaming machines into new and emerging markets  is based on competitive customer pricing and financing terms  appeal to the player and quality of the product  and having an extensive distribution and sales network 
sales to established casinos in nevada normally require completion of a successful trial period for the machines in the casino 
the competition for the computerized monitoring systems designed and sold by systems currently consists of igt  casino data systems and  to a lesser extent  acres gaming  inc  gaming systems international  inc 
and mikohn gaming corporation 
competition is keen in this market due to the number of providers and the limited number of casinos and the jurisdictions in which they operate 
pricing  product feature and function  accuracy  and reliability are all main factors in determining a provider s success in selling its system 
systems believes the future success of its operations will be determined by its ability to bring new and innovative products to the marketplace while at the same time maintaining the base of loyal existing customers 
wall machines and amusements games 
germany s wall machine manufacturing industry is dominated by bally wulff and two of its competitors 
management believes these three entities collectively account for more than of the entire market for wall machines which exists almost exclusively in germany 
bally wulff s two major competitors have greater resources than the company and own and operate a significant number of arcades  which gives them a competitive advantage arising from a built in market for their games and the ability to test market new games in their own arcades 
in addition  wall machines compete for floor space in arcades with token machines  which are not subject to the strict german licensing requirements governing wall machines 
alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  route operations 
the competition for obtaining and renewing route contracts in nevada is high and continues to intensify 
such competition has  over time  reduced the company s gross profit margins for such operations 
in addition  such competition has required the company to provide financial incentives to retain or obtain certain route locations 
such incentives include long term lease commitments  guarantees of leases in favor of owners of local establishments  substantial advance deposits  payments of lease rentals in advance and loans for buildings and tenant improvement costs 
although the company believes that it now has adequate procedures for evaluating and managing such risks  historically substantial losses have been incurred in connection with such transactions reflecting  in part  former management s willingness to accept higher levels of risk to further its policy of emphasizing market share 
notwithstanding the change in the company s business strategy to one emphasizing profitability rather than market share  the future success of the company s route operations will continue to be dependent to some extent on its ability and willingness to provide such financial inducements 
although the company has historically generated sufficient new route contracts to offset the loss of old route contracts  due to increased competition  the increased sophistication and bargaining power of customers and possibly other factors not yet known  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain new route contracts or renew or extend its route contracts upon their expiration or termination  or that  if renewed or extended  the terms will be favorable to the company 
in louisiana  the company s route operations at the racetrack and otbs compete with various truck stops and locations with liquor licenses throughout the new orleans area  as well as riverboat gaming and one land based casino which may re open in new orleans 
casino operations 
the operation of casinos is also a highly competitive business 
the principal competitive factors in the industry include the quality and location of the facility  the nature and quality of the amenities and customer services offered and the implementation and success of marketing programs 
in sparks  nevada  the principal competition for the company s operations comes from larger casinos focusing on the local market 
the company s rainbow casino in vicksburg  mississippi faces intense direct competition from other gaming facilities serving this market 
competition from casinos in nearby locations may also be reducing the market area from which vicksburg casinos draw most of their patrons 
moreover  additional potential gaming sites remain in and around vicksburg and sparks  some of these sites may be closer to larger population centers and  if developed  might enjoy a competitive advantage over the company s casinos 
product development the future success of the company depends to a large extent upon its ability to design  manufacture and market technologically sophisticated products that achieve high levels of player acceptance 
the development of a successful new product or product design by a competitor could adversely affect sales of the company s products and force it to respond quickly with its own competing products 
the company s plans with respect to the introduction of more sophisticated technology into the electronic gaming machine market are designed to lead to an increase in market share and profitability for the company 
however  there is no assurance that any such products will be developed  or that if developed they will receive necessary regulatory approvals or be commercially successful 
sales to non traditional gaming markets the continued growth of the non traditional markets outside of nevada and atlantic city for electronic gaming machines is contingent upon the public s acceptance of these markets and an ongoing regulatory approval process by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
the company cannot predict which new jurisdictions or markets  if any  will approve the operation of electronic gaming machines  the timing of any such approval or the level of the company s participation in any such markets or that jurisdictions currently permitting gaming will continue to do so in the future 
foreign operations alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  the company s business in foreign markets is subject to the risks customarily associated with such activities 
these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls  expropriation  nationalization and other economic  tax and regulatory policies of local governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 
the company does not generally enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
in addition  the proposed conversion of currency in germany from the deutschemark to the euro will require the company to redesign new and  possibly  existing bally wulff wall machines and gaming devices to accept such new currencies  the financial impact of which is uncertain 
dependence on key personnel the success of the company will be dependent  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of a relatively small group of executive personnel 
the loss or unavailability of one or more of such executive officers or the inability to attract or retain key employees in the future could have an adverse effect upon the company s operations 
in december  the company s president and chief executive officer stepped down as the company s strategic direction changed after the bgii acquisition 
in june   the company named morris goldstein as its president and chief executive officer

the company and its key personnel have obtained  or applied for  all government licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits and approvals necessary for the manufacture and distribution  and operation where permitted  of its gaming machines in the jurisdictions in which it currently does business 
however  there can be no assurance that such licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits or approvals will be given or renewed in the future or that the company will obtain the licenses necessary to operate in emerging markets 
gaming was previously licensed by the new jersey commission as a gaming related casino service industry  which is required by the new jersey casino control act in order for the company to sell gaming devices and systems in new jersey 
due to the change of ownership of gaming as a result of the bgii acquisition  gaming s new jersey license was invalidated 
prior to the change of ownership of gaming and in anticipation of same  the company submitted an application for casino service industry licensure 
the new jersey commission deemed the application complete and  as a result  since the bgii acquisition the company s operations in new jersey have continued uninterrupted pursuant to transactional waivers which have been granted by the new jersey commission on a six month blanket basis for parts and service and on a sale by sale basis for all other products pending final action on the company s license application 
the company s business is dependent on regulatory requirements 
for example  recurring demand exists for bally wulff s products because german regulations limit the permissible use of wall machines to a period of four years 
a change in applicable regulations could adversely affect the market for the company s products and services 
the company currently has an agreement with fair grounds corporation  jefferson downs corporation and finish line management corporation to be the exclusive operator of video poker machines at the only racetrack and ten associated otbs in the greater new orleans area

the german federal constitutional court recently let stand a regulation that permits local municipalities to impose additional taxes on gaming machine operators 
in the past  the imposition of such taxes by certain municipalities has adversely affected bally wulff s sales 
there can be no assurance that municipalities will not impose new taxes or raise existing taxes in the future 
the company pays and expects to continue to pay substantial taxes and fees in nevada  louisiana and mississippi and expects to pay substantial taxes and fees in any other jurisdiction in which it conducts gaming operations 
there can be no assurance as to future increases in taxation on gaming operations
