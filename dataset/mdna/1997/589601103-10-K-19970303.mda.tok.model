item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general prior to  the company then known as parallan computer  inc developed and supported high performance network superservers 
during  the company exited its prior business and product line  which had generated substantial losses 
the company fundamentally changed its business in december with the purchase of meridian data  inc mdi 
the total purchase price was million 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and included million allocated to in process research and development which was charged to expense on december  since the acquisition  the company has been engaged in the business of developing cd rom software products and selling cd rom networking software both separately and integrated with cd rom network servers 
due to the fundamental operational change in the company s high performance network superserver business brought about by the transition from manufacturing to royalties and service in  to the subsequent exit from that business and product line in  and the acquisition of mdi on december   management believes that any comparison between   and would not be germane to the discussion of or operating results 
since december   the company s revenues consist primarily of the sale of meridian products 
mdi s results of operations are included in those of the company from december  the following discussion focuses primarily on material events which occurred during the year ended december   and the material events and trends for the four quarters of and because the company generally ships its software and systems within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and total revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
the company s quarterly operating results may also vary significantly depending on other factors  including the introduction of new products by the company s competitors  market acceptance of new products  seasonality  mix of software and systems sales  adoption of new technologies and standards  price and other forms of competition  the cost  quality and availability of third party components used in the company s systems  changes in the company s distribution arrangements  and the inability of the company to accurately monitor end user demand for its products due to the sale of products through distributors and vars 
in and  identifiable sales to federal governmental agencies accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s product sales  and the company anticipates that such sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
in the event that there is any reduction or deferral in spending by such governmental agencies  the company s quarterly results may be adversely affected 
similarly  if such government agencies reduced their purchases of meridian products in favor of those of its competitors  the company s quarterly results may be adversely affected 
moreover  the company s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality in the form of higher sales for its products during the quarters ending in september and december and weaker sales during the quarters ending in march and june 
the company s operating results will also be affected by the economic condition of the personal computer industry  which has from time to time experienced cyclical  depressed business conditions  often in connection with or in anticipation of a decline in general economic conditions 
results of operations the statement of operations data on the following pages for the years ended december  and and the balance sheet data at december  and are derived from the financial statements of the company which have been audited by price waterhouse llp  independent accountants 
the statement of operations data for each of the quarters in the years ended december  and and the balance sheet data for the quarters ended march  june  and september  and  are derived from the unaudited financial statements and include all adjustments  consisting of normal recurring accruals  which the management of the company considers necessary for the fair presentation of the information set forth therein 
the operating results of any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 
in late and early  the company made several decisions to address the disappointing systems revenue growth experienced in the last three quarters of late in the fourth quarter of  meridian increased its sales and promotional expenditures and at the end of january significantly reduced system prices due to competitive pressures 
the company believes that it will be at least several months at a minimum before any positive revenue results from these actions will become evident  if at all 
as a result  the company anticipates that its earnings for at least the first half of will be below those of  and there can be no assurance that earnings will improve thereafter

the company s product sales increased from million in to million in  an increase of approximately  due to higher sales in the first quarter of this increase was driven by sales of new software products released throughout and a resulting increase in the company s system sales 
sales for the last nine months of were flat over the comparable period of during this time  the company s revenue mixed shifted towards higher software sales and lower system sales 
this was due to increasing price competition on system sales beginning late in the second quarter of and a heavy promotional emphasis on software products by the company throughout in response to the heightened competitive environment  meridian increased promotional spending in the fourth quarter of and  in january  reduced prices on its systems by approximately 
as a result of the january price decreases  the company expects that its revenues will be sequentially down from the fourth quarter of through at least the first two quarters of  and there can be no assurance that revenues will improve thereafter 
the company s sales in the first quarter of were favorably impacted by new software products released over the prior twelve months 
in the second quarter of  sales decreased from the prior quarter due to the heightened company and customer focus on meridian s software products 
this resulted in a shift in meridian s revenue mix towards higher software content  and lower sales of systems 
included in the company s second quarter sales was approximately  from the sale of two software site licenses 
sales in the third and fourth quarters of continued the trend from the second quarter  exacerbated by increased price competition from the company s largest competitors 
the company s revenue mix continued its shift towards higher software content and lower sales of systems 
as this trend accelerated  meridian s revenue growth slowed  while gross margin increased 
approximately of the company s product sales are derived from two tier distribution sales to distributors and vars 
two distributors  ingram micro  inc and techdata corporation  accounted for and  respectively  of meridian s product sales 
the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations

the company s product sales in the first quarter of consisted primarily of dos based products  some of which had become non competitive 
in the second quarter of  sales increased over the first quarter primarily due to the commercial release in june of the company s windows based cd net plus v and customer response to increased advertising 
sales in the third quarter of increased over the second quarter primarily as a result of a full quarter of sales of cd net plus v  customer response to increased advertising  the introduction of companion releases for windows nt and banyan vines networking environments  and federal government purchases at the end of its fiscal year 
fourth quarter sales increased over the third quarter due to the impact of calendar year end business purchases and the continuing favorable reception of the products introduced in the second and third quarters 
product sales to non ibm customers in totaled million which consisted of million of sales and service revenue related to non ibm parallan customers and million of meridian product sales for the month of december other revenue 
other revenue totaling million in the first quarter of consisted of a non recurring sale of oem software relating to the company s former network superservers product line 
in the second quarter of  other revenue of million resulted from the recognition of project revenue that had been attributed to the company s former product line and deferred from the company does not expect any additional revenues from its former product line 
product sales and services to and royalties from ibm there were no product sales and service to  and royalties from ibm in product sales and services to and royalties from ibm were million and million in and  respectively 
revenue related to ibm in consisted of project revenue deferred from no future product sales and services to  or royalties from ibm are expected 
gross margin gross margin on product sales  exclusive of amortization of purchased technology  increased from in to in this increase was due to the higher proportion of software sales in the company s revenue mix in relation to systems sales  site licenses  and increased price performance ratios for cd rom drives 
in january  meridian lowered prices on its cd rom networking systems by approximately due to competitive pressures 
the company anticipates that this will result in a reduction in its gross margin percentage in gross margin was    and in the four sequential quarters of  respectively 
throughout  gross margin was favorably impacted by the increase in the proportion of meridian s revenues derived from the sale of stand alone software products  sales of site licenses in the second quarter  and increased price performance ratios for cd rom drives gross margin  excluding other revenue and including the amortization of purchased technology  was   and in the four sequential quarters of  respectively 
during the first quarter of  the company s gross margin was adversely impacted by a general decrease in prices for the company s products  particularly due to competition for low end networked cd rom systems  and additional reserves for inventory obsolescence 
the company s gross margin generally increased after the first quarter of as a result of increased sales of the company s stand alone software products  the increase in the product mix to higher margin systems with higher software content  and the completion in the second quarter of of the cost reduction program implemented in the first quarter of the company s gross margin increased in the second half of as compared to the first half of due to the completion in the second quarter of of amortization of purchased technology 
technology acquired in the purchase of meridian data  inc was amortized over its estimated useful life of seven months  beginning at december  amortization of purchased technology was million for  all of which occurred in the first half of another factor affecting meridian s gross margin in was the declining cost of purchasing cd rom drives manufactured in japan  reflecting changes in exchange rates for the yen  increased price competition  and availability 
cost of sales in was entirely due to the inclusion of one month of meridian cost of sales in the company s results of operations 
for a discussion of certain risks affecting cost of sales  see risk factors dependence on third party suppliers and expansion of international operations  foreign currency fluctuations 
amortization of purchased technology there was no amortization expense in technology acquired in the purchase of mdi was amortized over its estimated useful life of seven months  beginning in december purchased technology had been completely amortized by june  cost of product sales and services to  and royalties from ibm there was no cost associated with product sales and services to  and royalties from ibm in or the cost of product sales and services to  and royalties from ibm in exceeded the level of product sales due to manufacturing overhead expenses which were geared to a higher level of shipments than occurred 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expense in was million  an increase of million  or  over this increase was due to higher payroll  overhead expenses  and the amortization of an advance made to a development stage company dsc  developing a media independent software search technology 
as envisioned  the product would allow searches of textual  audio  and video data stored on corporate intranets  the internet  or such possible future media such as digital video disc s dvd s 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with dsc 
as part of this agreement  meridian loaned million the loan to dsc  which was recorded in other assets 
in return  the company received warrants convertible into the common stock of dsc  the right to license dsc s software technology  and a security interest in dsc s technology 
to the extent that dsc expends the funds advanced under the loan  meridian reduces the carrying value of this investment and recognizes the expense as research and development expense 
as a result  the company recorded million in research and development expense which reflects meridian s estimate of the development activities of dsc through december  the company expects to record additional charges to research and development expense concurrent with dsc s development efforts due to uncertainty over the future realization of the loan 
meridian is under no obligation to advance additional funds to dsc 
the company expects research and development expense to increase in both in absolute dollars and as a percent of sales 
research and development expense consists of salaries and related expenses incurred in the development of the company s products  as well as expenses related to consultants and prototype material purchased in the development of the company s cd rom networking software and extensions of its system offerings 
research and development expense was million in each of the first three quarters of  and million for the fourth quarter 
this represents approximately    and of product sales  respectively 
for a discussion of certain risks related to research and development  see risk factors rapid technological change  potential for product defects 
research and development expense was million  million  million and million for the four quarters of  representing   and of product sales  respectively 
research and development expense declined in absolute dollars in the second quarter of from the first quarter due to reductions in the number of research and development consultants and employees as a result of organizational changes made following the acquisition of meridian data  inc research and development expense increased moderately in the second half of as a result of higher spending on new products which were subsequently released in late and early meridian believes that  as cd rom server hardware increasingly becomes a commodity item  it will be difficult to create a significant competitive advantage through hardware development 
therefore  the company devotes substantially all of its engineering resources towards software development 
for a discussion of certain risks related to research and development  see risk factors rapid technological change  potential for product defects 
in  research and development expenses were million 
this includes approximately  of research and development expense related to meridian products incurred in the month of december the remaining expense was related to the company s development of a new server for ibm  which ibm eventually declined to accept

sales and marketing expense was million in  and increase of approximately million  or over this increase was to higher payroll and related expenses  and increased advertising and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expense was million for each of the first three quarters of  and million in the fourth quarter 
this represented approximately    and of product sales  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  meridian substantially increased is promotional and advertising expenditures to counteract decreasing revenues and increasing price competition

as such  the company anticipates that sales and marketing expenses will increase in the future both in absolute dollars and as a percent of sales 
sales and marketing expense was million  million  million and million in the four quarters of  representing   and of products sales  respectively 
in the last six months of the company expanded its marketing efforts  increased its product introduction expenses  and shifted its advertising from vertical niche periodicals to broad industry publications  such as pc week and lan times

in process research and development acquired in mdi acquisition after allocating the purchase price to net tangible assets  acquired technology  which represented mdi s current products  was valued by an independent appraiser using a risk adjusted cash flow model 
under the model  future cash flows were discounted taking into account risks related to existing and future markets and an assessment of the life expectancy of the acquired technology 
this analysis resulted in an allocation of million to acquired technology  which was capitalized in other assets 
the acquired technology was amortized over seven months  beginning december  with respect to mdi s in process r d at december   none had reached a stage where feasibility  delivery  or product features were certain 
prior to the acquisition by the company  mdi had begun developing applications and system software for windows 
however  mdi s experience developing and marketing windows based applications or systems was minimal 
acquired research and development in process was valued by an independent appraiser using the same methodology as the acquired technology 
expected future cash flows associated with acquired in process r d were discounted considering risks and uncertainties related to the viability of the products  to the work required to establish feasibility  and to the completion of products that will be ultimately marketed by the company 
this analysis resulted in an allocation of million to acquired in process research and development expense 
this amount  which is not deductible for tax purposes  was charged to operating expense at the acquisition date 
restructuring costs in  meridian recorded two restructuring charges totaling million 
the total charge included million in non cash charges relating to the write off of fixed assets and prepaid expenses and million for anticipated cash charges 
the first charge of million was accrued in the second quarter of and was related to the downturn in business with ibm 
this charge consisted primarily of the write down of fixed assets identifiable with meridian s relationship with ibm  estimated carrying costs of excess capacity  and a provision for noncancleable purchase commitments 
in december of  with the acquisition of mdi  the company took an additional charge against earnings of million 
this charge was primarily related to occupancy expenses incurred in connection with terminating the lease on the mountain view  california  office  severance pay for certain employees  and the write off of certain fixed assets 
the total number of employees terminated due to reductions during was these employees responsibilities covered all functional departments 
restructuring actions were completed during other income and expense interest income and expense 
interest income increased to million in due to funds provided by a public offering of the company s common stock in april interest income decreased from million in to million in due to the use of funds required in acquiring mdi 
interest income could decrease in the future if the company were to acquire another company or technology  or if interest rates were to decline 
income taxes the company s estimated effective tax rate for and was approximately and respectively 
this rate is lower than the statutory rate due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
the company s tax liability results primarily from federal and state alternative minimum taxes  as well as state franchise taxes 
at december   the company has a net operating loss carryforward for us federal income tax purposes of approximately million that expires between and the net operating loss carryforward includes approximately million of tax deductions resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
the tax benefit of this deduction  when realized  will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders equity rather than as a reduction in the income tax provision 
the company has federal research and development tax credit carryovers of approximately million at december   that expire primarily in through the company s net operating losses  tax deductions and credit carryforwards may be limited by changes in ownership as defined under the internal revenue code 
based on the company s evaluation of the weight of available evidence  it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will be realized and therefore has provided a full deferred income tax valuation allowance at december  meridian did not have income tax expense in due to net operating losses 
the company did not record any benefit of these losses due to uncertainty as to their realization 
the charge for purchased research and development of million in was not deductible for tax purposes 
capital resources and liquidity meridian s source of cash flow from operations for was principally net income from operations adjusted for noncash depreciation and amortization charges and the amortization of advance for research and development arrangements 
these were offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of sales  and a decrease in account payable and accrued payroll related expenses 
the company s capital expenditures for were approximately million 
the company s source of cash flow from operations for was principally net income from operations adjusted for noncash depreciation and amortization charges 
these were offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales  payment of restructuring expenses accrued at december   and a decrease in deferred revenues 
the company s capital expenditures for were approximately million 
also included in cash flows from investing activities in was million for cash released from the restricted escrow account set up as part of the acquisition of mdi 
on april   the company completed an offering of  shares of its common stock at an offering price of per share the offering 
the net proceeds from the offering were million 
in conjunction with the offering  the company acquired an option to repurchase million shares of common stock from certain shareholders the option 
the company exercised the option on may  for an aggregate of million 
the balance of the net proceeds from the offering were million and were invested in marketable securities 
meridian believes that success in its industry requires substantial capital in order to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
the company may  from time to time  as market and business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies  or develop products in house which leverage off the company s extensive experience in networking software and server development 
such investment or acquisitions may be funded by internally generated cash  marketable securities  or additional equity 
the sale of additional equity could result in dilution in the equity ownership of the company s shareholders 
at december   meridian s principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and marketable securities totaling million and accounts receivable of million 
the company believes that its current cash and marketable securities  and accounts receivable will satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through the end of
