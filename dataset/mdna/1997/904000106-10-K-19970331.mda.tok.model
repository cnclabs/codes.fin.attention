item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general on december   the company issued  shares of its common stock and  shares of its newly created cumulative convertible preferred stock in exchange for all the outstanding common and cumulative convertible preferred stock of diamond shamrock  inc diamond shamrock pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated september  common shareholders of diamond shamrock received shares of uds common stock for each share of diamond shamrock common stock and one share of uds cumulative convertible preferred stock for each share of diamond shamrock cumulative convertible preferred stock 
the company also amended its certificate of incorporation to change its name to ultramar diamond shamrock corporation 
the merger was accounted for using the pooling of interests method 
the company s operating results are affected by company specific factors  such as its refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance turnarounds  seasonal factors  such as the demand for petroleum products and working capital requirements in the northeast  both of which vary significantly during the year  and industry factors  such as movements in and the general level of crude oil prices  the demand for and prices of refined products and industry supply capacity 
the effect of crude oil price changes on the company s operating results is determined  in part  by the rate at which refined product prices adjust to reflect such changes 
as a result  the company s earnings have been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future 
during  the company changed its method of accounting for refinery maintenance turnaround costs from an accrual method to a deferral and amortization method to better match revenues and expenses 
the change resulted in a cumulative adjustment through december  of million after income taxes of million or 
per share  which is included in net income for the year ended december  to facilitate the comparison to the results of operations for the years ended december  and  historical data for the year ended december  has been adjusted to reflect the change in accounting for refinery maintenance turnaround costs as if the new method had been applied from the inception of the company

refinery operating expenses in included the cost of the brief operation and then closure of the company s halifax  nova scotia refinery following the expiration of the company s processing agreement with statoil north america inc selling  general and administrative expenses of million during were million lower than in as a result of reduced transportation and other marketing related costs during and one time non officer employee bonuses of million recorded in combined interest and taxes net interest expense was million in compared to million in average borrowing increased from billion in to billion in and the average interest rate on the company s borrowings approximated in both and the impact of increased borrowings was partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest to million in from million in as a result of various major capital projects underway in the provision for income taxes in of million decreased  as a percentage of pre tax income  from in to in  principally as a result of non taxable income recognized in from changes in accounting estimates and the favorable settlement of previously accrued liabilities as well as certain state income tax credits in the southwest 
environmental matters the company s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the company has accrued liabilities for estimated site restoration costs to be incurred in the future at certain facilities and properties 
in addition  the company has accrued liabilities for environmental remediation obligations at various sites  including the multiparty sites in the southwest where the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party 
under the company s accounting policy  liabilities are recorded when site restoration and environmental remediation and cleanup obligations are either known or considered probable and can reasonably be estimated 
at december  and  accruals for environmental matters amounted to million and million  respectively 
charges to income during for environmental matters  principally to conform the accounting of diamond shamrock and ultramar  totaled million 
environmental charges during the two years ended december  were not significant 
total future environmental costs cannot be reasonably estimated due to unknown factors such as the magnitude of possible contamination  the timing and extent of remediation  the determination of the company s liability in proportion to other parties  improvements in clean up technologies and the extent to which environmental laws and regulations may change in the future 
although environmental costs may have a significant impact on results of operations for any single period  the company believes that such costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial position 
see item business regulatory matters environmental for further discussion of these matters 
capital expenditures the refining and marketing of petroleum products is a capital intensive business 
significant capital requirements include expenditures to upgrade or enhance operating facilities to meet environmental regulations and maintain the company s competitive position as well as to acquire  build and maintain broad based retail networks 
the capital requirements of the company s operations consist primarily of i non discretionary expenditures  such as those required to maintain reliability and safety and to address environmental regulations including reformulated fuel specifications  stationary source emission standards and underground storage tank regulations  and ii discretionary opportunity expenditures  such as those planned to expand and upgrade its retail marketing business and to increase the capacity of certain refinery processing units and pipelines 
during  capital expenditures totaled million and included the completion of a high pressure gasoil hydrotreater at the wilmington refinery and a heavy gasoil hydrotreater at the three rivers refinery 
the addition of the gasoil hydrotreaters increases each refinery s ability to upgrade unfinished product into finished product and to process lower cost  heavy crude oil and less expensive feedstocks 
other capital projects included modifications to the quebec refinery to enhance its ability to process acidic crude oils and modifications to accommodate a unit train to transport product from the refinery to montreal 
capital expenditures also included construction of a second million pound per year propylene splitter at mont belvieu which was completed in august marketing related capital expenditures in included construction of new retail stores  principally in arizona  and the acquisition of home heating oil and wholesale distribution operations in the northeast united states 
additional capital projects included the rebranding and integration of the acquired ncs stores into the company s southwest system 
the rebranding and integration program included signage on the street and at the service station pumps and upgraded security  computerization and store interiors 
although the company intends to continue to pursue acquisitions and other capital investment opportunities  the company s objective is to reduce capital expenditures on presently operating assets 
capital expenditures budgeted for total million  a substantial decrease from the company s four year annual average through of million 
over the next five years the company plans to invest approximately million to expand and upgrade its retail and wholesale marketing operations in the southwest and northeast 
the company plans to expand its retail marketing presence through the acquisition and construction of approximately company owned and operated stations with convenience stores 
the current estimated cost of the southwest retail growth program for the next several years is million 
in the northeast  the company plans to continue a program begun in to operate up to of the sites it owns or controls in its eastern canadian retail marketing network 
in connection with the program  the company intends to invest approximately million over the next five years by adding approximately convenience stores to existing and new company operated locations 
in addition  the company plans to spend approximately million over the next five years to expand its retail home heating oil business  primarily through acquisitions in eastern canada and the northeastern united states 
the following table sets forth a summary of the growth capital projects planned by the company for the next several years at its refineries 
many of the projects contain both a non discretionary component and a discretionary component intended to take advantage of opportunities to achieve a high return on investment 
the estimates of the level of expenditures set forth below  are based upon the company s current expectations 
it should be noted that investment plans are subject to change depending on further detailed engineering and economic studies and that construction costs  which are particularly difficult to anticipate  could change substantially if the demand for construction outstrips supply 
the effect of these uncertainties upon the estimates set forth below could be material and there can be no assurance that actual costs will not exceed these estimates 
estimated future project purpose project costs in millions crude oil and conversion unit capacity increases modifications to increase the capacity to process available feedstocks and improve light product yields heavy crude oil processing improvements modifications to increase heavy crude oil processing capability advanced computer controls modifications to improve process control and increase light product yields light products distribution expansion modifications to increase pipeline  terminal and railcar distribution capacity the company believes that the quebec provincial government will issue new refinery liquid effluent regulations during that  if adopted  will require modifications and additions to the quebec refinery s waste water treatment facilities 
the company has completed a detailed process design and estimates the cost of potential capital expenditures required to comply with the expected regulations to be approximately million 
it is expected that any required construction for the modifications and new equipment would begin in and be completed to meet the anticipated new regulations 
see item business regulatory matters environmental canadian operations 
the company is continually investigating strategic acquisitions and other business opportunities  some of which may be material  that will complement its current business activities 
the company expects to fund its capital expenditures over the next several years from cash provided by operations and  to the extent necessary  from the proceeds of borrowings under its bank credit facilities and its commercial paper and medium term note programs discussed below 
in addition  depending upon its future needs and the cost and availability of various financing alternatives  the company may  from time to time  seek additional debt or equity financing in the public or private markets 
liquidity and capital resources the company had a cash position of million at december  following the merger  the company negotiated new committed  unsecured bank facilities which provide a maximum of million of available credit to the company the us facility and cdn 
million of available credit to canadian ultramar company cuc  formerly canadian ultramar limited 
in addition  the company has a million commercial paper program supported by the us facility 
the bank facilities extend through and reflect a reduction in interest rates compared to the facilities they replaced 
the company s bank facilities and certain of its other debt instruments require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and contain covenants that must be complied with to maintain borrowing privileges 
the company believes these covenants will not have a significant impact on the company s liquidity and ability to borrow funds as needed 
at december   the company had approximately million of borrowing capacity under the bank facilities and commercial paper program and approximately million of borrowing capacity under uncommitted short term lines of credit with a number of financial institutions 
the company also has the ability to issue an additional million of medium term notes under a million shelf registration filed with the security and exchange commission in august in  the company entered into a long term lease agreement the jamestown lease to accommodate its retail outlet construction program 
pursuant to the terms of the lease  the lessor has agreed to finance the acquisition and or construction of retail marketing sites up to million and to lease these sit es to the company 
after the non cancelable lease term  which expires in july  the jamestown lease may be extended by agreement of the parties  or the company may purchase or arrange for the sale of the retail outlets 
substantially all of the million commitment is presently available to the company 
the company believes its current sources of funds will be sufficient to satisfy its capital expenditure  working capital  debt service and dividend requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in february  the company s board of directors declared a common stock dividend of 
per share payable on march   to holders of record on february  in addition  the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 
per share on its cumulative convertible preferred stock  payable on march   to holders of record on february  cash flow net cash provided by operating activities  consisting principally of net loss income adjusted for depreciation and amortization  provisions for losses on receivables  changes in deferred income taxes and changes in working capital accounts  amounted to million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
investment activities consist principally of refining and marketing capital expenditures and acquisitions  net of the proceeds of asset disposals in the ordinary course of business and  beginning in  deferred refinery maintenance turnaround costs 
net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  amounted to million 
in june  diamond shamrock issued million of debentures due in july in addition  the company had borrowings under its various bank credit facilities and commercial paper program aggregating million during the year ended december  during the company repaid million of long term debt consisting of million of scheduled debt maturities and million under its various bank credit facilities 
other financing activity in included million of proceeds received principally from the exercise of employee stock options and dividend reinvestment  million received from diamond shamrock s esops and from the sale of treasury stock and the payment of million in preferred and common stock dividends 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities totaled million including million of proceeds from a secondary offering of the company s common stock and the exercise of employee stock options and dividend reinvestment and million of proceeds from long term borrowings including million of medium term notes  million of and debentures and million of borrowings under its various credit facilities 
during  the company repaid million of long term debt consisting of million of scheduled debt maturities and million under its credit facilities 
the company also received million from its esops and the sale of treasury stock and made preferred and common stock dividend payments of million during financing activities in the year ended december  did not result in a change in the company s net cash position as the proceeds of long term borrowings and the exercise of employee stock options and dividend reinvestment were offset by the repayment of short and other long term debt and the payment of preferred and common stock dividends 
the effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the company s net cash position during the three year period ended december  was not material 
income taxes at december   the company had deferred tax assets of million and million and deferred tax liabilities of million and million from its us and canadian operations  respectively 
current accounting standards require  among other things  recognition of future tax benefits measured by enacted tax rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that the realization of such benefits is more likely to occur than not 
the realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on the company s ability to generate taxable income in both the us and canada 
management has determined  based on the company s history of operating earnings and its expectations for the future  that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note income taxes 
outlook the company s earnings depend largely on refining and retail marketing margins 
the petroleum refining and marketing industry has been and continues to be volatile and highly competitive 
the cost of crude oil purchased by the company as well as the price of refined products sold by the company have fluctuated widely in the past 
as a result of the historic volatility of refining and marketing margins and the fact that they are affected by numerous diverse factors  it is impossible to predict future margin levels 
in general  industry inventories are lower than they were a year ago 
this should bode well for the industry as we enter the driving season 
in addition  backwardation has moderated in the crude oil market and crude oil prices have been declining and are relatively stable at present 
although  we believe crude oil spreads will be improved over  we do not expect a secular improvement in the industry in the near term 
california refining margins have improved in early due in part to persistent refinery problems experienced by some competitors and scheduled turnarounds in the industry 
the retail margins  although improving  remain weak because of the very competitive west coast market 
early in the first quarter  the refining margins in texas remain weak due to the fall in product prices 
if product prices stabilize  refining margins should improve as the refineries run the lower cost crude 
retail margins in texas and surrounding states are weak and remain flat from the fourth quarter 
in eastern canada  refining spreads have weakened while retail margins have strengthened because of strong heating oil retail prices 
derivative financial instruments the company uses interest rate swaps and forward contracts  foreign exchange contracts and commodity futures  forward and option contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate  exchange rate and commodity price volatility 
the company controls its derivative positions based on their underlying principal values and does not transact derivative positions that exceed the company s underlying business exposure 
the company does not use complex  leveraged derivative transactions with the intent of producing speculative gains 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note financial instruments 
seasonality in the northeast  demand for petroleum products varies significantly during the year 
distillate demand during the first and fourth quarters can range from to above the average demand during the second and third quarters 
the substantial increase in demand for heating oil during the winter months results in the company having significantly higher accounts receivable and inventory levels during the first and last quarters of each year 
the company s southwest operations are less affected by seasonal fluctuations in demand than its operations in the northeast 
the working capital requirements of the southwest operations are limited  due to lower inventory requirements and show little fluctuation throughout the year 
exchange rates the exchange rate between the canadian and us dollar has weakened substantially from the inception of the company in the rate  however  has remained relatively constant during the three year period ended december  as well as during the first two months of the company expects the exchange rate to fluctuate during but cannot reasonably predict its future movement 
as the company s canadian operation is in a net asset position  the weaker canadian dollar has reduced  in us dollars  the company s net equity at december  by million 
with the exception of its crude oil costs  which are us dollar denominated  the weaker canadian dollar has also had the effect of reducing  in us dollars  the revenues and the related costs and expenses reported by the company s canadian operation 
the potential impact on refining margins of fluctuating exchange rates together with us dollar denominated crude oil costs is mitigated by the company s pricing policies in canada  which generally pass on any change in the cost of crude oil 
marketing margins  on the other hand  have been adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuation  as competitive pressures have  from time to time  limited the company s ability to promptly pass on the increased costs to the ultimate consumer 
the company periodically enters into short term foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the negative effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the trade payables of its canadian operation that are denominated in us dollars 
the company generally does not hedge the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of its foreign results of operations or financial position 
however  the company has considered various hedge alternatives available to it  along with their attendant costs  and expects to hedge the translation impact when such hedging is considered economically appropriate 
impact of inflation although inflation has slowed in recent years  it is still a factor in the us and canadian economies  increasing the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment and increasing the costs of supplies and labor 
as previously noted  to the extent permitted by competition  the company passes along increased costs to its customers 
in addition  the company is affected by volatility in the cost of crude oils and refined petroleum products as market conditions continue to be the primary factor in determining the costs of the company s products 
the company uses the lifo method of accounting for its inventories 
under this method  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current cost and thus reduces distortion in reported income
