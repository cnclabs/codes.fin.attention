sufficient taxable income exists in the carryback periods to recognize the deferred tax asset  accordingly  no valuation allowance has been recognized

liquidity and capital resources on november   the company entered into a new collateralized revolving credit facility the new facility with a syndicate of banks led by national city bank of pennsylvania national city bank  providing for loans or letters of credit up to million  subject to formula based availability 
the syndicate consists of four banks  with national city bank  lasalle national bank  and harris trust and savings bank each committed for a ratable share of  and heller financial  inc committed for an ratable share 
the new facility replaces the existing million collateralized credit agreement with first source financial llp 
of the million available under the new facility  approximately million was used to refinance previously existing senior indebtedness and million was used to redeem the company s series a redeemable preferred stock 
the company redeemed the preferred stock at a discount to face value resulting in a gain of million 
as of september   the unused portion of the new facility was approximately million with approximately million of availability 
on february   the company completed the private placement of the debentures 
the debentures are due february  and are convertible into shares of common stock  without par value  of the company at a conversion price of per share 
the debentures will become subject to redemption at the option of the company on february  at a price of 
the redemption price will decrease at a rate of per year  reaching a price of in the year and remaining fixed until the date of maturity 
the indebtedness evidenced by the debentures is subordinated and junior in right of payment to the extent of payment in full of all amounts due on all senior indebtedness 
the debentures bear an annual interest rate of with semi annual payments in august and february  beginning august  the company filed a registration statement to register for resale the debentures and the shares of common stock underlying the debentures with the securities and exchange commission on may  and the registration statement became effective on june  the net proceeds raised on issuance of the debentures were used in conjunction with the rental king acquisition see note to the financial statements 
on october   the company exercised its right to convert mandatorily the million convertible subordinated notes the notes held by massachusetts mutual life insurance company and certain of its affiliates 
the notes were convertible by the company at a conversion price of per share upon the company s common stock trading at a price above per share for consecutive days during any day period 
the notes converted into  shares of common stock  which have been registered for resale pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed by the company that became effective in june for the year ended september   the company s net cash provided by used in operating activities increased to million from million for the year ended september  the increase was principally due to a million increase in rental merchandise purchases  a million increase in net income  a million increase in non cash depreciation and amortization  a million decrease in other liabilities  a million decrease in income taxes payable and a million increase in deferred income taxes 
the increase in depreciation and amortization and rental merchandise resulted primarily from the coleman acquisition and the rental king acquisition  which significantly increased the size of the company 
for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   the company s net cash used in investing activities increased to million from million 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to the acquisitions and the remodeling costs and computer hardware costs incurred in connection with the coleman acquisition and the rental king acquisition 
for the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september   the company s net cash provided by financing activities increased to million from million 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was principally due to cash received in connection with the company s private placement of the debentures issued in connection with the rental king acquisition 
historically  the company s growth has been financed through internally generated working capital  borrowings under its available credit facilities and  in connection with acquisitions  issuances of its common stock  preferred stock and convertible debt 
during fiscal  the company s acquisitions were financed by a combination of cash generated by the company s private placement of the debentures and borrowings under the new facility 
the company s primary requirements for capital other than those related to acquisitions consist of purchasing additional rental merchandise and replacing rental merchandise that has been sold or is no longer suitable for rent 
the company intends to increase the number of stores it operates primarily through acquisitions 
such acquisitions will vary in size and the company will consider large acquisitions that could be material to the company 
to provide any additional funds necessary for the continued pursuit of its growth strategies  the company may incur  from time to time  additional short and long term bank or other institutional indebtedness and may issue  in public or private transactions  its equity and debt securities  the availability of which will depend upon market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
inflation during the year ended september   the cost of rental merchandise  store lease rental expense and salaries and wages have increased modestly 
these increases have not had a significant effect on the company s results of operations because the company has been able to charge commensurately higher rental for its merchandise 
this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future
