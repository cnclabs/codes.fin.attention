recent accounting pronouncements 
in  the financial accounting standards board fasb released the statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  earnings per share 
sfas simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share eps and makes them comparable to international eps standards 
it replaces the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps 
it also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted eps on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic eps computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted eps computation 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after december   including interim periods 
sfas requires restatement of all prior period eps data presented 
management has not yet determined the impact of sfas on the company s statements 
in october  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition which supersedes sop  software revenue recognition 
this sop provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions 
this sop is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe this statement will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations
