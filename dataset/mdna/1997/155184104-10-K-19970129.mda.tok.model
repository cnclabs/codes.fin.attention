the company s programs to develop and expand production and marketing of products have continued to increase sales 
the company experienced unit sales gains in sales of virtually all major product groups 
the glass bulb fire sprinkler models continue to lead the company s sprinkler sales gains 
strong market demand helped the company achieve increased unit sales in other products that are sold for use in complete automatic fire sprinkler systems 
the company also experienced particularly strong unit sales of its valves and cpvc plastic pipe and fittings products 
sales also benefited from several new or expanded distribution centers and sales offices in the us and abroad as well as the expansion of the company s pipe and fittings product lines 
in fiscal  domestic sales increased and sales outside the us increased from fiscal the company has experienced very competitive conditions in the sprinkler market causing increased price competition resulting in depressed sales prices 
sales were also unfavorably impacted early in the fiscal year due to severe weather conditions in many parts of the us which slowed construction activity and demand as well as construction and expansion delays limiting production at the company s grooved fittings facility in alabama 
the significant increase outside the us is the result of increased marketing efforts worldwide  increased production capacity in the us and at spraysafe and new sales offices in hong kong and china 
in july  the company announced sales list price increases of on most of its sprinkler and valve products in an effort to improve the company s gross profit 
fiscal net sales were million  an increase of million or from the net sales recorded in fiscal the significant increase in sales was led by the strong demand for fire sprinklers and related products

cost of sales for fiscal  in terms of dollars of expense  increased or million from fiscal the increase in cost of sales is due to higher sales volume  increased costs of manufacturing and an unusual non recurring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company s cost of sales increased to of net sales from of net sales in fiscal this resulted in a gross margin percentage of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin percentage was due to several items 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an unusual non recurring charge of million resulting from the program announced by the company to encourage customers to test and possibly replace some omega tm sprinklers that have been exposed to harmful substances in certain installations 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
excluding the unusual non recurring charge  cost of sales as a percent of net sales would have been in fiscal and the gross margin percentage would have been in fiscal another factor reducing the gross margin percentage in fiscal from fiscal were increased costs of manufacturing sprinklers  valves and associated products 
in response to increased sales volumes  the company significantly increased production levels which resulted in some manufacturing inefficiencies 
these inefficiencies along with higher raw material costs and the delay in the startup of the grooved fittings facility all contributed to the reduction in gross margin in fiscal late in fiscal the company experienced improvement in sprinkler and valve manufacturing efficiencies as compared to earlier in the fiscal year 
the expansion of the grooved fittings facility which depressed earnings in the earlier quarters of fiscal improved in virtually all areas in the fourth quarter including improved production levels and lower costs per unit

the company s cost of sales decreased to of net sales from of net sales in fiscal this resulted in a gross margin percentage of in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase in gross profit margin percentage was due primarily to a stronger sales mix of higher margin product lines 
other factors include additional sales from new products  certain price increases that were put into effect in fiscal and lower costs of certain products 
the increase in production of manufactured fire sprinkler products to meet market demand has increased utilization of the company s production capacity 
this has resulted in a lower unit product cost for certain products 
the gross profit margin percentage for fiscal was somewhat lower than expected due to the costs related to the continuing expansion of the foundry and manufacturing facility for grooved piping products acquired in late fiscal the gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by price increases to the company from suppliers of certain materials in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal such expenses were of net sales in fiscal as compared to of net sales in fiscal the principal increases in selling  general and administrative expenses are due to the increase in sales volume and the expansion of its distribution operations to better serve existing and new customers

selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal the reduced percentage of such expenses to net sales is due to sales increasing at a faster rate than the selling  general and administrative rate of increase 
the total dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses increased by or million from fiscal the majority of the increase in expenses is due directly to the increased sales volume 
the expense increases included a higher amount of personnel  fringe benefits  freight  travel and certain marketing costs

the effective income tax rate for fiscal was as compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective income tax rate includes a higher effective state income tax rate due to several factors that also increased the effective us federal income tax rate 
one factor is a substantial reduction in the nontaxable investment income in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulting from a lower balance in investments 
the company also had a higher level of pretax income 
income before income taxes increased by million  or  to million 
the higher level of pretax income combined with lower amounts of nontaxable income and tax credits proportionately reduces the favorable effect on the effective tax rate in fiscal the company s sales are affected by seasonal factors and the weather as well as the level of new construction activity  remodeling and retrofitting of older properties in the commercial  industrial  residential and institutional real estate markets 
the company s sales tend to increase the most when there is a high level of new construction activity in all such real estate markets
