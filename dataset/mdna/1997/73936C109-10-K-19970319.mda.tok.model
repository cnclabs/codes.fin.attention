these licenses encompass an area of approximately  square miles with a population of approximately million people and  when combined with the company s existing licensed territory  give the company one of the largest contiguous pcs footprints in the southeastern united states 
the company will pay approximately million for these licenses of which the company has already paid million and expects the final grant of these licenses to occur in the second quarter of the company expects its expanded pcs footprint to provide a competitive advantage in attracting new customers in its markets 
average revenues per subscriber in the wireless industry have declined during recent years and are expected to continue to decline in the future 
the company believes that this downward trend is the result of the addition of lower usage customers who utilize cellular service for personal convenience  security or as backup for their traditional landline telephones 
in addition  the company expects that revenue per minute will continue to decline as competition within the wireless telecommunications industry intensifies 
the company believes the effect of this trend on the company s earnings will be mitigated by corresponding increases in the number of subscribers and the number of minutes of usage per subscriber 
the company s overall historical financial performance has been impacted positively by its efforts to attract and retain subscribers and encourage more use of its services 
unlike many other companies in the cellular industry that continue to experience operating losses due to the substantial capital costs associated with constructing a system and acquiring licenses  the company has been successful in achieving positive operating income from its cellular operations

the southern cellular market s churn rate decreased to from in while the churn rate for the maine cellular market increased from to during the same period 
the company believes that its improved churn rate in the southern cellular market is due to continued efforts to ensure consistently high levels of customer satisfaction coupled with a proactive customer retention program 
the company offers its pcs customers a choice of multiple pricing plans  with varying amounts of unbilled or free minutes included in the monthly access charge 
from november  to january   the company offered its customers with the exception of certain subscribers in the memphis area who were unable to obtain the pcs handset model of their choice due to a handset shortage in that market and for whom the promotional pricing extends through april  a special  limited time promotional pricing plan  the prestige partners promotion  in all of its operational markets 
this special limited time promotional pricing plan offered unlimited local airtime through december  for a per month access charge excluding toll and roaming charges  taxes and other optional fees

additionally  the company s depreciation and amortization expense will significantly increase as a result of the fixed assets and pcs licenses related to pcs systems placed in service during and as a result of systems to be placed in service in and thereafter
