cash earnings earnings before amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amounted to million or per common share in the major components of the company s operating results are summarized in the comparative earnings analysis table 
net interest income increased in over after having increased less than in over without valley s net interest income of million  net interest income in would have increased by million or over net overhead  which is the amount by which noninterest expense exceeds noninterest income  increased in from and in over excluding valley  net overhead for would have been below by million or 
the provision for possible loan losses charged to earnings increased in from after reflecting a decrease in from without valley s provision of  in  the provision for loan losses would have increased by 
applicable income taxes increased by million or following an decrease in over net interest income 
net interest income  which is the difference between interest and fees earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and other funding sources  is the primary source of earnings for the company 
this component represented approximately of the company s net revenues in a detailed analysis highlighting the changes in net interest income is provided in the analysis of changes in interest differential table 
interest earned on tax exempt loans and investments is adjusted for comparative purposes to a taxable equivalent basis using the federal tax rate of  resulting in a fully taxable equivalent fte net interest income 
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled million in compared to million in and million in the significant increase in net interest income in includes an increase of million due to volume increases in following a million increase due to volume in the volume increase was fueled by the earning assets and interest bearing liabilities added to the company s balance sheet in through the acquisition of valley 
rate movements also increased net interest income by million in after negatively impacting net interest income by million in average earning assets increased by million or for with increases of million in loans  net of unearned income  and million in investment securities 
the average earning assets include million of loans  net of unearned income  and million of investment securities of valley 
interest bearing liabilities increased million or for with valley adding million in interest bearing liabilities 
absent valley  interest bearing liabilities increased by million the net of increases of million in time deposits  and million in subordinated and other long term notes  offset by decreases of million in short term borrowings  million in interest bearing demand deposits and million in savings deposits 
the increase in time deposits in continues the trend which began in during  the company introduced its anydayeveryday account which is priced to yield a return above the average money market rate 
this product continues to be very successful in terms of generating time deposits for the company 
the company s net interest margin measured on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased to in from in and in although the company continues to experience significant pressure on net interest margin  the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was compared to in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of provision and allowance for possible loan losses 
the allowance for possible loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated probable loan losses 
to facilitate the periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses  the company utilizes a loan grading system that helps identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  should they arise  in an accurate and timely manner 
credits of a significant nature are reviewed on an individual basis and a specific allocation of the allowance for possible loan losses may be made if so warranted 
the company s charge to earnings as a provision for possible loan losses was approximately million in  million in and million in net loan charge offs amounted to million in  million in and million in net charge offs as a percent of average loans outstanding were  
and 
for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   the company s allowance for possible loan losses totaled million or of total loans outstanding as compared to in and in the ratio of the allowance for possible loan losses to nonperforming loans of for compares to at the end of and at december  nonperforming loans including nonaccrual loans  accruing loans past due days or more  and restructured loans amounted to million at year end compared to million at year end and million at year end nonperforming loans represented just 
of total loans outstanding at december  compared to one year ago and at the end of nonperforming assets nonperforming loans plus other real estate owned represented 
of total assets  the lowest level in the past five years and significantly better than the company s peer ratio of 
other than those loans included in the nonperforming assets table and related notes thereto  there are no other loans which management is closely monitoring  or which have been classified by bank regulators  which are being monitored or classified because of trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity or capital resources 
noninterest income and expense analysis increase decrease amount amount dollars in thousands noninterest income fiduciary fees     service charges on deposit accounts     other service charges     net securities gains  other income    total noninterest income     noninterest expense salaries and wages      employee benefits     
net occupancy expense     equipment expense     fdic assessment     amortization of goodwill and other intangibles   
other expense      total noninterest expense      noninterest income and expense 
a ratio often used to evaluate the noninterest income and expense performance of banking organizations is the efficiency ratio 
this ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense by the total of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis and noninterest income less securities transactions 
the lower the ratio  the more efficient the organization is at generating income in relation to the expenses incurred to obtain that income 
the company has historically outperformed its peers with efficiency ratios of  and  respectively in  and compared to peer ratios of  and  respectively for the same periods 
excluding the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  the company s efficiency ratio would be  and  respectively in  and during  fiduciary fees increased million or from following the increase in from valley contributed less than million to the increase 
the market value of assets under supervision by the company s trust and investment group continues to increase  amounting to billion at december   up from billion at december  and billion at december  service charges on deposits grew million or in after increasing in over while valley added million to this category in  the company continues to realize an improvement in its collection of various deposit fees 
other service charges increased  or in however  other service charges at valley amounted to  therefore  this category decreased by  or net of valley 
this category also decreased by million in from the variance from to is attributed primarily to a decrease in insurance premium income of  a decrease in merchant discount fees of  and a decrease in income generated from referrals on annuity prospects of  the decrease was also attributed to a decrease in income generated from referrals on annuity prospects of  other income reflected a  or increase in from with  contributed by valley and  contributed by an increase in electronic banking income 
in addition  the company recognized  in capitalized originated mortgage servicing rights as a result of adopting statement  accounting for mortgage servicing rights an amendment to statement other income reflected a  or increase in from as the company generated net gains on sales of loans of  in and net losses on sales of loans of  in sales of loans netted a gain of  in securities transactions amounted to a net gain of  in compared to  in and  in substantially all of the net securities gain in was due to the sale of certain common stock held by the company 
total noninterest expense increased in over  yet just without valley s million of noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased in over salaries and wages reflected a million or increase in over million or excluding valley and a million or increase in over the number of full time equivalent employees increased to  at december  from at year end and at year end valley had full time equivalent employees at december  the increase in salaries and wages in is the result of the employees added with the valley acquisition  general merit increases and an increase in incentive and other bonus compensation of  exclusive of valley 
the increase over resulted from general merit increases and the additional staff needed to support new products and services and increased loan and deposit volumes 
employee benefits increased by million or in from  consistent with the increase in salaries and wages 
employee benefits reflected only a minor increase in from as the result of favorable claim experience which allowed the company s health insurance premium rates to remain the same in as in net occupancy expense increased million or in over  or excluding valley  reflecting increases in building depreciation  utilities  insurance and rent 
net occupancy expense increased just  or in over equipment expense increased by million or in from  or excluding valley and  or in over both the and increases are due to higher depreciation on equipment as the company continues to roll out its corporate wide loan documentation teller station platform technology 
the most significant decrease to noninterest expense for and occurred in the fdic insurance expense 
this category decreased by million or in and million or in the fdic insurance fund met its federally mandated level of of insured deposits during the second quarter of therefore  the company s fdic insurance expense was reduced from the prior rate of 
per of insured deposits to 
per of insured deposits 
beginning in january of  well capitalized financial institutions were not assessed a premium 
beginning in january of  the fdic insurance rate has been increased to 
per of insured deposits and  therefore the company expects to incur approximately  in fdic insurance premiums in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased by million in over  reflecting the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisition of valley in the acquisition of valley created million of goodwill and other intangibles for which the ongoing annual amortization will be million 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles relating to previous acquisitions of the company accounted for under the purchase method of accounting was virtually identical in  and other expense increased by million or in from  or excluding valley 
professional fees including legal  accounting  and management consulting  covering such services as acquisition planning  strategic planning  loan work out activities  and asset liability management activities increased million 
however  in certain other expenses decreased as was impacted by conversion expenses relating to the company s trust software and operating expenses on loan collateral 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was in  in and in the company s effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes differs from the statutory marginal federal and state tax rates 
this is attributable principally to the tax exempt income that is earned on various earning assets and the disallowance of a tax deduction on certain recorded expenses 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of income taxes 
analysis of financial condition the company s total assets at december  increased by million or from the prior year and totaled over billion 
loans outstanding totaled over billion and total deposits exceeded billion 
these amounts include the assets  loans and deposits of valley of million  million and million  respectively 
loans 
all categories of lending increased during both including and excluding loans outstanding at valley on december  excluding valley  loans increased by million or 
commercial lending increased by million or of which million was outstanding at valley 
installment loans totaled million at december  million without valley compared to million at december  despite increases in each of the previously mentioned lending categories  real estate lending  including real estate mortgage and real estate construction loans  continues to be the major component of the company s loan portfolio 
real estate loans represent of the company s total loan portfolio at year end this category of loans increased by million or from year end with such loans at valley amounting to million 
as the company s underwriting policy for family residential loans follows that of industry standards and meets the criteria for sale in the secondary market  the company s real estate loan portfolio is of high quality 
the majority of the company s real estate lending is concentrated in the company s market area of north central and northeastern indiana 
investments 
total investment securities increased million or from december  with valley adding million 
in  investment securities increased million or over on average during  investment securities increased million or 
excluding valley s average investment securities of million  average investment securities increased by million or 
this follows a decrease of million or in from the increase in average securities in is attributable to average funding sources increasing at a faster rate than average loan growth while in the opposite was true 
average short term investments  including federal funds sold and time deposits with other banks  increased million or in after increasing million or in from however  million of the increase was from short term investments outstanding at valley 
during and  the company purchased approximately million and million of securities designated as trading  respectively  and sold trading securities with a carrying value of million and million  respectively 
realized gains losses on sales of trading securities amounted to  in and  in there were no investment securities held for trading purposes at december  the carrying value of securities held for trading purposes at december  was million including a recognized unrealized gain of  the company s investment portfolio continues to be of high quality as evidenced by us government and other federal agencies representing approximately two thirds of the total outstanding in each of the past three years 
the company s holdings of states and other political subdivisions decreased slightly to of the total portfolio compared to in and in other investments  including us agency mortgage backed securities  corporate debt securities and other securities represented or less of the total portfolio at the end of  and deposits 
the primary source of funds for the company comes from demand and time deposits generated at the affiliate banks 
total deposits as of december  increased by million or with million of this increase attributable to outstanding deposits at valley on december  in  total deposits increased by million or over the levels achieved at the end of as depicted in the deposits table  total average deposits increased by million or of which valley contributed million 
however  as was realized in and  the company continues to experience a shift in the mix of the different deposit categories 
while noninterest bearing demand deposits as a percent of total average deposits remained relatively stable at in  in and in  interest bearing demand deposits as a percentage of total average deposits decreased to in from in and in average savings deposits also decreased to in from in and in offsetting these decreases were increases in average time deposits to total average deposits to in from in and in the time deposits category includes the company s popular anydayeveryday account which averaged million in  million in and million in short term borrowings and long term debt 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase consist primarily of repurchase arrangements commercial customers of the company s affiliate banks utilize for cash management services 
in  average federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased million or with million of the increase coming from average federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase of valley 
in  this funding category increased by million or on average from the prior year 
the other category of short term funding available to the company is notes payable to the us treasury 
as indicated in the short term borrowings table  this category can fluctuate significantly during the year 
this is a result of the timing of tax deposits made by customers and the call for these funds made by the government 
this category  however  has been a relatively small source of funds for the company 
long term debt increased to million at december  during  the company borrowed million from another financial institution on a term basis to help facilitate the payment of the cash portion of the merger consideration paid to former shareholders of vfs 
the company also assumed million of federal home loan bank and other long term debt of valley and million of junior subordinated notes of vfs 
pay downs on pre existing  incurred and acquired debt totaled million and  in and  respectively  as a result of scheduled principal payments 
for a further discussion of the company s long term debt obligations  maturities  and related dividend and other restrictions  refer to notes and in the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements 
capital resources 
capital adequacy is one of the main measurements used by bank regulators to determine the strength of a financial institution 
a strong capital position will enable the company to access capital markets under more favorable terms 
in addition  a strong capital base encourages depositor and investor confidence in the institution 
on april   the company s shareholders approved an increase from  to  in the total authorized shares of common stock  enabling the company to effect the three for two stock split that was declared by the board of directors on january  this split was paid on may  to shareholders of record on april  in addition  during the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
during and  the company repurchased  and  shares of its common stock at a total cost of million and million  respectively 
in connection with the acquisition of vfs  on june  the company issued  shares of series convertible class b nonvoting preferred stock with a value of million and  shares of common stock with a value of million 
dividends declared in totaled million  including dividends on preferred stock of million and dividends on common stock of million 
this compares to dividends declared on common stock of million in and million in on january   the company s board of directors increased the annual common dividend to  up from the declared in and the 
declared in the dividend payout ratio for was compared to for and for asset liability management as the company s loans and deposits are designed to meet customer preferences  maturity mismatches will occur within the balance sheet 
it is the goal of the company s asset liability management committee to manage these maturity mismatches in a way to provide a maximum level of net interest income within established policy guidelines of liquidity and interest rate risk exposure 
interest rate sensitivity 
the degree by which net interest income may vary due to changes in interest rates is measured through interest rate sensitivity management 
a static gap report  measured at a single point in time  measures the difference between assets and liabilities that reprice in a future given time period 
the company s gap ratio the percentage of assets repricing against liabilities at december  was 
the company has historically operated with a liability sensitive position meaning more liabilities reprice on a cumulative basis than assets 
this indicates net interest income should increase in declining rate scenarios and decrease in rising rate scenarios 
however  as rate movements are rarely parallel  a gap report can only be considered a rough measurement of the direction a rate movement could have on net interest income 
the effect of a shift in the yield curve and or a change in the spread between certain rate indexes is better measured through the use of simulation modeling 
the company runs the simulation model numerous times throughout the year comparing baseline results earnings under a flat scenario to earnings under dynamic rate scenarios 
the exposure to these changes are well within the company s guidelines 
should exposures be determined outside of tolerance levels  the company has tools it can use to minimize the risk to earnings 
among these tools are specific investment decisions  pricing structures of deposit funds  and exchange traded financial futures and options 
for a complete discussion of the company s use of derivative contracts  refer to note in the company s consolidated financial statements 
rate sensitivity analysis the following table presents an analysis of the rate sensitivity of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  maturing or repricing non rate total sensitive year over days days days under years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets net loans        investment securities        other earning assets    total interest earning assets        other assets   total assets        interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits        short term borrowings     long term notes        hedged interest bearing liabilities    total interest bearing liabilities        demand deposits   other liabilities   deferred gain on sale of premises shareholders equity   total liabilities and shareholder s equity        rate sensitivity gap     cumulative rate sensitivity gap  cumulative rate sensitivity gap ratio 


the sensitivity of investment securities is based on the earlier of call dates or scheduled maturities 
liquidity 
guidelines are established through the asset liability management committee to ensure a stable source of funding to meet both the expected and unexpected cash demands of loan and deposit customers 
the company maintains a stable base of core deposits provided by long standing customer relationships 
the company complements this source of liquidity with short term borrowings through correspondent bank relationships in addition to other corporate customers 
many corporate customers utilize the company s cash management program sweeping excess deposit funds into repurchase agreements 
therefore  the company considers the majority of its repurchase agreements as another source of stable funds 
the greatest source of liquidity for the company is its marketable securities 
while the company classifies all of its investments as available for sale  the investment portfolio is highly liquid as approximately of the portfolio consists of marketable us treasury or federal agency securities 
in addition  the company s investment strategy calls for laddering the maturities of investments purchased 
therefore  there is another million of other investments scheduled to mature during that can also be used to meet liquidity demands if necessary 
inflation and changing prices reported earnings are affected by inflation  indirectly through changing interest rates and directly by increased operating expenses 
however  general price level inflation has not had a material effect on the information presented herein 
industry outlook and regulatory changes the company continues to be optimistic about the future of the banking industry 
recent legislative developments which the company sees as encouraging include the depository institutions affiliations and thrift conversion act 
this proposed legislation would eliminate the thrift charter and permit affiliations between commercial banks  insurance companies  and securities firms under a holding company structure 
in addition  the deposit insurance funds act  which became law on september  directs the secretary of the treasury to make recommendations to congress for the establishment of a common charter for banks and savings associations 
it is expected that the proposal from the treasury department to congress would include recommendations that commercial banks be allowed to engage in the full range of insurance and securities activities 
both of these legislative initiatives are aimed at modernizing the financial services industry and eliminating some of the competitive disadvantages which banks must currently overcome in the financial services marketplace 
the deposit insurance funds act required certain depository institutions to pay a one time special assessment to the fdic in order to bring the savings association insurance fund saif to its required reserve ratio 
it also authorized the financing corporation fico to impose periodic assessments on both saif institutions and institutions that are members of the bank insurance fund bif  including the company  in order to spread the cost of interest payments on the outstanding fico bonds over a larger number of institutions 
as a result  the company s fdic insurance premiums were increased from zero to 
per of insured deposits 
this will result in approximately  of additional expense to the company in while this is not good news for the company  the deposit insurance funds act does call for the merger of the saif and bif into the new combined deposit insurance fund on january  the strength of this combined fund along with the movement towards allowing for a common financial institutions charter are seen by the company as positive events in the long term health of the financial services industry 
turning from the national level to the local level  the company continues to be very excited about the overall business climate in its market area of north central and northeastern indiana 
this market area is characterized by increasing economic activity  low unemployment and good prospects for growth 
the company continually looks for creative ways to attract and retain customers 
the highly successful anydayeveryday time deposit account is an example of this creativity 
the company also continually challenges its operations and its delivery systems to provide higher quality services to its customers 
in the past two years the company has made significant investments in technology  such as the new loan documentation teller station platform systems in order to give our employees the best tools to use in servicing our customers 
the company has been fortunate to be a very well capitalized company 
this position has allowed for the necessary investments in technology 
it also provides the company with the ability to expand through strategic acquisitions  such as the acquisition of valley 
and finally  a strong capital position has and will continue to give the company the flexibility to buy back some of its outstanding stock and increase dividends  both actions which should enhance shareholder value
