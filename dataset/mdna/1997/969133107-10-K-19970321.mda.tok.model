item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s two basic businesses  paper products and building materials  are affected by changes in general economic conditions 
paper product sales and earnings tend to follow the general economy 
the sales and earnings of the building materials business are closely related to new housing starts  remodeling activity and to the availability and terms of financing for construction 
the cost of wood and recycled fiber  basic raw materials for both industry segments  is sensitive to various supply and demand factors  including environmental issues affecting log supply 
results of operations vs 
net sales decreased by in compared with the record levels achieved in pricing in all paper product lines decreased from the record levels and pricing pressures occurred throughout as the market adjusted to further corrections of paper inventories 
as a result  paper product sales decreased by as selling prices decreased or more for all products 
unit shipments of unbleached products had mixed results in as corrugated containers increased  while grocery bag shipments declined from for bleached products  cut sheet shipments increased by while continuous forms remained stable 
the cut sheet increase is primarily due to the sales from the new sheeter production at owensboro  kentucky added in late during the fourth quarter of  selling prices for unbleached products showed little change while prices for bleached products continued to weaken from the third quarter of building materials sales increased in compared with as increases in sales volume more than offset decreases in sales price realizations 
although lumber prices marginally increased during  prices in the structural panel and composite board markets continued to decline due to supply and demand imbalances created by construction of new facilities 
as a result  structural panel and composite board product lines had sales price decreases ranging from to compared to levels 
unit shipments increased in lumber  mdf and osb primarily due to capacity increases in  achieved through acquisitions and expansion from capital projects 
a sawmill in warrenton  oregon was acquired in the second quarter  and a new mdf plant in clonmel  ireland was acquired in the fourth quarter 
in addition  the newly converted mdf plant in eugene  oregon and the new osb facility in arcadia  louisiana came on line in the first half of as a result  lumber and mdf sales volumes increased and respectively  in the gross profit margin for all products was for compared with for the same period in paper product gross margins decreased to in compared with in  reflecting the decrease in selling prices in from the record levels in in addition  increased shutdown days in to adjust for inventory buildup in the market and for capital expansion projects had a negative impact on margins 
partially offsetting the effect of decreased sales and down time was the decline in old corrugated container occ prices  a raw material recycled to manufacture paper  which decreased compared to building materials gross margins decreased to compared to in the decrease in building materials margins is the result of declining prices in the structural panel and composite board markets 
additionally  start up costs associated with the new osb and mdf facilities  as well as the th quarter start up of the new lvl facility and custom products relocation at albany  oregon negatively affected margins 
selling and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in compared to in while the increase was due primarily to lower net sales  selling and administrative expenses increased in from due to expansion of company operations and costs of new facility start ups 
interest expense was million in compared to million in interest expense increased as a result of increased debt related to the acquisitions discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
partially offsetting the increase in outstanding debt was the decrease in the company s weighted average interest rate from in to for additionally  capitalized interest increased from million in to million in due to the significant capital projects underway 
results of operations vs 
net sales increased in compared with paper product sales increased as selling prices increased by or more in all paper product lines 
except for grocery bags and corrugated container shipments  unit sales volumes increased by or more in all paper product lines 
grocery bag and corrugated container shipments were down and respectively from mainly due to exceptionally strong demand for these products during during the fourth quarter of  selling prices for all paper product lines declined from record levels achieved in the third quarter of building materials sales decreased in compared with mostly due to lower unit shipments in all building materials product lines 
unit shipments declined primarily due to weaker building materials markets  downtime taken associated with the completion of capital expansion projects and the closure of the sweet home  oregon plywood plant in the fourth quarter of except for lumber  selling prices in all building materials product lines were higher in than  however  prices in the fourth quarter of were lower in all product lines than for the first three quarters of the gross profit margin was for compared with for paper product gross margins increased to in compared with for reflecting the record level selling prices achieved for all paper product lines 
in addition  gross margins in were not impacted by the start up costs incurred in for the installation of a new pulping facility and paper machine at the company s johnsonburg  pennsylvania mill 
another significant improvement to gross margins in was the start up of the second linerboard machine at campti  louisiana  which allowed the company to replace linerboard previously purchased outside with internally produced product at a much lower cost 
partially offsetting the increase in gross margins was the escalation of old corrugated container occ prices by compared with building materials gross profit margins decreased to compared with in the drop in building materials margins is mainly due to decreases in unit shipments coupled with higher log costs and increased glue and resin costs 
selling and administrative expenses declined to of net sales in compared with for the drop was due to higher net sales as selling and administrative expenses increased between and mainly due to expansion of the company s operations 
other income expense was 
million in versus million for the expense in was mostly due to the closure of the sweet home  oregon plywood plant with a related charge of million 
interest expense was million in compared with million in because the company s average outstanding debt decreased million between and  gross interest declined to million in versus million in capitalized interest declined to million in versus million in the weighted average interest rate of all debt was at december  compared with at december  liquidity and capital resources willamette generates funds internally via net earnings adjusted for non cash charges against earnings such as depreciation  cost of fee timber harvested and deferred income taxes 
funds generated externally have usually been through debt financing 
in  cash flows from operating activities were million and represented a decrease of from comparable cash flows in this decrease was primarily due to a decline from the record level of net earnings achieved in internally generated cash flows continued to fund of capital expenditures in net working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease is primarily due to reductions in inventories and receivables 
the decrease in inventories of million was due to quantities being unusually high at december  and the receivables decrease of million was primarily due to lower net sales 
the company is continually making capital expenditures at its manufacturing facilities to improve fiber utilization  labor efficiency and to expand production 
in  the company made capital expenditures of million 
during the following major capital projects were completed o construction of an osb facility in arcadia  louisiana 
o construction of a new lvl and custom products plant in albany  oregon 
o conversion of the eugene  oregon particleboard plant to manufacture mdf 
o upgrade of recovery boiler and chemical and fiber recovery at kingsport  tennessee bleached pulp mill 
o expansion of pulping capacity at the marlboro county  south carolina fine paper mill 
major capital projects underway at december  include the following o addition of new fine paper machine and related pulping capacity at hawesville  kentucky 
o construction of a new corrugated box plant in plant city  florida 
o construction and installation of a new boiler at the kingsport  tennessee bleached pulp mill 
o expansion of secondary fiber capacity at the paper mill in campti  louisiana 
o construction of a new cut sheet plant in brownsville  tennessee 
o modernization of the sawmill at coburg  oregon 
the cost of all major capital projects in progress at december  is estimated to be approximately million of which million has already been spent 
these projects will be funded with internally generated cash flows and with external borrowings if needed 
in may the company acquired the timber operations of cavenham forest industries  inc the cavenham acquisition  in louisiana and the pacific northwest as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company funded the acquisition with cash and billion of borrowing under a credit agreement between the company and a group of banks providing for a revolving loan and a term loan 
on july   the company issued million in debentures 
the proceeds from the sale were used to reduce indebtedness under the term loan used to fund the cavenham acquisition  thus the debenture issuance had no effect on the company s total debt to capital ratio at that time 
in november   the company completed the acquisition of medite of europe  discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  for million in cash  plus certain closing costs 
the transaction was financed by borrowings from the revolving loan under the credit agreement 
the total debt to capital ratio has increased to at december  from at december  due to the acquisitions discussed above 
the company anticipates it can maintain its present course of capital spending over the next three years and still reduce its debt to capital ratio to below by despite a significant increase in the company s debt to capital ratio  rating agencies have maintained the company s credit rating in the a range  thereby preserving its cost of capital 
additionally  the company believes it has the resources available to meet its short term and long term liquidity requirements 
resources include internally generated funds  short term borrowing agreements and the unused portion of the revolving loan available under the credit agreement 
in april   the board of directors of the company increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to  from  other matters the company believes it is in substantial compliance with federal  state and local laws regarding environmental quality 
the environmental protection agency previously issued proposed rules regarding air and water quality referred to as the cluster rules 
the final rules are expected to be released sometime in with implementation expected to be required by the year in addition to the impact of the cluster rules on pulp and paper mills  the company s other operations are faced with increasingly stringent environmental regulations 
based upon either enacted or proposed regulations  the company estimates that over the next five years  additional capital expenditures which are not yet in progress to comply with environmental regulations will not exceed million 
although future environmental capital expenditures cannot be predicted with any certainty because of continuing changes in laws  we believe that compliance with such environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s competitive position 
much attention has been given to the controversy concerning preservationists efforts to stop the harvest of timber from federal timberlands in the northwest 
concurrent with these efforts have come increased regulations  limitations and restrictions on the harvest of timber from privately owned timberlands 
current rules and regulations do not significantly impact the company s ability to manage its oregon timberland on a sustained yield basis 
over the years  inflation has resulted in replacement costs higher than those originally needed to purchase existing plants and equipment 
advancing technology and environmental concerns also contribute to higher costs 
productivity gains  because of technological improvements  may partially offset these increased costs 
our use of lifo to value inventories allows us to include these inflationary costs in the cost of sales
