in fiscal year  the company generated million in total revenue  of which million was derived from information technology services and million was derived from sales of computer equipment and supplies 
the remaining million in revenue was derived from license and maintenance fees for the company s platform migration software  payment processing systems and other verticle market software products 
the company expects revenue from software licensing to increase as a percentage of total revenue in the future as these relatively new software products penetrate their target markets and gain market acceptance 
during each of the last three fiscal years  approximately of the company s revenue was derived from its international operations 
denomination of the company s revenue and expenses are generally in corresponding currencies 
as a result  to date  the company has not hedged against foreign currency exchange rate risks 
cost of sales for maintenance and information technology services includes supplies  parts  subcontractors and other direct costs of delivering the services  except for salary costs  which are included in selling  general and administrative costs 
cost of sales for computer equipment and supplies consists of the actual cost of the products sold 
cost of sales for software licensing includes amortization of capitalized software development costs  as well as any royalties payable on embedded technologies 
the company amortizes capitalized software development costs over the estimated life of the product  generally three to four years 
gross margins can increase significantly as software licensing revenues increase over amortization costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries and related costs for all employees  travel  internal equipment  sales commissions  premises and marketing costs  as well as general office and administrative costs 
development grants received from the government of northern ireland have been recorded as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses  or a reduction in capitalized development costs  and are anticipated to remain relatively constant for the foreseeable future 
although the company expects the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as the company grows  it anticipates that these expenses will remain constant or decrease as a percentage of total revenue 
during fiscal year  the company began investing additional resources in sales and marketing efforts associated with the introduction and promotion of several new products and services which were released during the year including unibol  unibol nt  and year conversion services 
the company also continues to expand its payment processing operations particularly increasing the number of employees associated with sales  marketing  programming  support and installation services 
additionally  the company anticipates the hiring of additional sales and technical service personnel as the company further rolls out its year conversion services 
these activities have increased selling  general  and administrative expenses in advance of increases in revenue 
while these expenditures will continue for the foreseeable future  the company believes that additional revenue will be generated as the result of these activities and that these expenditures as a percentage of total revenue will begin to decline

under the new program  one time license fees are replaced by monthly processing fees which ties the company into a longer term  recurring revenue relationship with these customers 
in may  the company entered into an agreement where one of its customers requested that the company allow it to return systems it had previously purchased to be installed under the new contract terms 
because total revenue expected to be generated from the customer over the next two to three years is anticipated to be significantly increased under the new program as compared to the one time license fee arrangement  the company made a strategic decision to enter into the new agreement even though it called for the return of previously sold systems

these grants are subject to the legislative rules and regulations of northern ireland and the united kingdom 
management does not anticipate that the receipt of grants will diminish significantly in the foreseeable future  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to receive such grants 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and available credit  if necessary  will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs both on a short and a long term basis 
however  the company s capital needs will depend on many factors  including the company s ability to maintain profitable operations  the need to develop and improve products  and various other factors 
depending on its working capital requirements  the company may seek additional financing through debt or equity offerings in the private or public markets at any time 
the company s ability to obtain additional financing will depend on its results of operations  financial condition and business prospects  as well as conditions then prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to the company 
seasonality and inflation the company s operations have not proven to be significantly seasonal  although quarterly revenues and net income may vary 
although the company cannot accurately determine the amounts attributable thereto  the company has been affected by inflation through increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses 
the company believes that these have not had a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
factors that may affect future results the business of the company is subject to national and worldwide economic and political influences such as recession  political instability  the economic strength of governments  and rapid change in technology 
the company s operating results are dependent on its ability to rapidly develop  manufacture  and market innovative products that meet customers demands 
inherent in this process are a number of risks that the company must manage in order to achieve favorable operating results 
the process of developing new high technology products is complex and uncertain  requiring innovative designs and features that anticipate customer needs and technological trends 
the products  once developed  must be manufactured and distributed in sufficient volumes at acceptable costs to meet demand 
this annual report contains both historical facts and forward looking statements 
any forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to risk of product demand  market acceptance  economic conditions  competitive products and pricing  difficulties in product development  commercialization  technology  and other risks detailed in this filing 
although the company believes it has the product offerings and resources for continued success  future revenue and margin trends cannot be reliably predicted 
factors external to the company can result in volatility of the company s common stock price 
because of the forgoing factors  recent trends are not necessarily reliable indicators of future stock prices or financial performance
