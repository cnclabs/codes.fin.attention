see note to financial statements 
management has determined that it is more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets will be realized  therefore  no valuation allowance is necessary as of september  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  management has considered future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of such reversing differences 
positive evidence considered include the company s history of increasingly profitable operations  and the availability of its existing net operating loss nol carryforwards which expire in and the adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance means that future results of operations will reflect income tax expense or benefits  as appropriate 
due to the existence of valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets  results of operations for the fiscal years ending september   or did not include such income tax expense or benefits 
therefore  comparison of future results of operations on an after tax basis to those of fiscal  or will not be meaningful

earnings per share  sfas 
sfas simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share eps previously found in apb opinion no 
 earnings per share  apb  and make them comparable to international eps standards 
sfas replaces the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps 
basic eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity 
diluted eps is computed similarly to fully diluted eps pursuant to apb sfas also requires presentation of both basic and diluted eps on the face of the income statement for entities with complex capital structures and a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic eps computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted eps computation 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after december   including interim periods  earlier application is not permitted 
sfas requires restatement of all prior period eps data presented 
the company is currently evaluating sfas  however  management does not believe that sfas will have a material impact on the financial statements of the company
