the u 
s 
rig count for the last three years is reflected in the table below 
newpark s key market area includes i south louisiana land  ii texas railroad commission districts and  iii louisiana and texas inland waters and iv offshore gulf of mexico rig count measurement areas 
the rig count trend in the company s primary market has tracked the national trend as set forth in the table below q q q q us rig count newpark s key market newpark s key market to total the decline in the south louisiana and texas land rig count from through the first nine months of created downward price pressure on the site preparation and mat rerental businesses of the company 
prices were also negatively impacted by a significant shift in land drilling activity toward the austin chalk area 
the austin chalk is further inland and drilling locations less frequently require use of the company s mat system 
this downward price pressure did not begin to reverse until the fourth quarter of as shortages of equipment and supporting services in the land market began to appear as a result of increased land drilling activity 
in addition  the company was able to modify a portion of its mat fleet which allowed the company to compete with native rock foundations typically used in the inland areas  such as the austin chalk 
despite the decline in rig activity  the volume of waste received by newpark increased primarily due to i the recovery of the remediation market following implementation of norm regulations  and  ii new  more stringent regulations governing the discharge of drilling and production waste in the coastal and inland waters and in the offshore gulf of mexico

during the year ended december   the company entered into two transactions which were primarily non cash in nature for the acquisition of additional patent and other rights for use in the company s proprietary business operations 
the acquisition of these items is reflected in the increase in other assets and the increase in shareholders equity coupled with the increase in deferred taxes payable 
the company also sold the facility and certain equipment to the operator of the company s former marine service business 
these assets were being leased by the operator and were subject to debt obligations  which were assumed by the purchaser at closing 
in addition to the extinguishment of these debt obligations  newpark received million in cash in the transaction 
on june   newpark entered into a new credit agreement with a group of three banks  providing a total of up to million of term financing consisting of a million term loan to be amortized over five years and a million revolving line of credit

newpark was in compliance with all of the convenants in the credit agreement at december  the term loan was used to refinance existing debt and is being amortized over a five year term 
in march  the term loan was increased to million  and the million increase was used initially to reduce borrowings on the revolving line of credit portion of the facility 
in june  the company increased its borrowing through the credit agreement in the form of a day term loan in the amount of million which was repaid out of proceeds from the offering 
the funds were used to acquire board road mats 
the revolving line of credit matures december  in november  an amendment to the credit facility was approved which i eliminated the requirement of periodic borrowing base calculations  ii eliminated monthly financial reporting requirements  iii relaxed certain restrictions on guarantees and outside indebtedness  and  iv increased availability of borrowings under the facility 
this amendment had the affect of increasing the availability to the full million 
at december   million of letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the line and an additional million had been borrowed and was outstanding thereunder 
subsequent to december   the banks providing the credit facility approved a million increase in the facility 
the million increase involves a new term note for million with twenty equal quarterly payments of principal plus interest commencing june  with an initial maturity date of december  the proceeds of this new loan will be used to reduce the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit portion of the facility 
in addition  the revolving line of credit will increase from million to million 
potential sources of additional funds  if required by the company  would include additional borrowings 
the company presently has no commitments for credit facilities beyond its existing bank lines of credit by which it could obtain additional funds for current operations  however  it regularly evaluates potential borrowing arrangements which may be utilized to fund future expansion plans 
inflation has not materially impacted the company s revenues or income 
deferred tax asset the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard requires  among other things  recognition of future tax benefits measured by enacted tax rates  attributable to deductible temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss and credit carryforwards to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
management believes that the recorded deferred tax assets  at december  are realizable through reversals of existing taxable temporary differences
