item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restructuring of natural gas industry the company s principal operating subsidiary  pg energy inc pge  is a regulated public utility engaged in the sale and distribution of natural gas which accounted for approximately of the company s operating revenues in the natural gas industry  which historically has included producers  interstate pipelines and local distribution companies ldcs  is continuing to undergo significant restructuring 
the industry is rapidly progressing from a highly regulated environment to one in which there is competition  customer choice and only partial regulation 
the same change is also beginning to occur in the electric industry which competes with the natural gas industry for many of the same energy uses 
the restructuring of the natural gas industry has already involved the decontrol of the wellhead price of natural gas  and interstate pipelines have been required by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to separate the merchant function of selling natural gas from the transportation and storage services they provide frequently referred to as unbundling and to make those services available to end users on the same terms as ldcs 
these changes in the operations of the interstate pipelines were designed to enhance competition and maximize the benefits of wellhead price decontrol 
as a result of actions by ferc  the interstate pipelines now primarily provide transportation and storage services  and ldcs  such as pge  are presently responsible for the procurement of competitively priced gas supplies and arranging for the appropriate transportation capacity and storage services with the interstate pipelines 
additionally  in accordance with regulations promulgated by the pennsylvania public utility commission ppuc  pge currently offers transportation service to certain customers 
prior to the unbundling of services by the interstate pipelines and those services being made available to end users as well as ldcs  and until the ppuc adopted regulations providing for the transportation of natural gas  pge charged all its customers bundled rates 
these rates included a commodity charge based on the cost  as approved by ferc  which pge paid the pipelines for natural gas delivered to the entry point on its distribution system 
except for the approximately customers currently receiving transportation service  pge s customers continue to be charged bundled rates as approved by the ppuc  which include a commodity charge based on the costs prudently incurred by pge for the purchase of natural gas and for interstate pipeline transportation capacity and storage services 
customers receiving transportation service  which accounted for approximately of pge s total gas deliveries in  are charged rates approved by the ppuc  which exclude the commodity cost that is reflected in the bundled rates charged to other customers 
in december   legislation was enacted in pennsylvania which provides all customers of electric utilities in the state with the right to choose the generator of their electricity 
this customer choice  which is intended to increase competition and to lower costs for electricity  will be phased in over a three year period ending on january  under this legislation  the electric utilities in pennsylvania will be required to unbundle generation charges from the other charges included in their currently bundled rates and customers will contract with qualified suppliers of their choosing  including the utility currently serving them  to purchase electric energy at nonregulated rates 
the electric utilities will continue to utilize their transmission networks to distribute electricity to their customers regardless of supplier  a function which will remain subject to rate regulation by the ppuc 
the company and pge believe that pennsylvania may consider similar legislation with respect to the natural gas industry in such legislation may require that pge provide all of its customers with unbundled service over a period of several years 
while the rates for the transportation of natural gas through pge s distribution system and the storage services offered by pge may continue to be price regulated by the ppuc  the commodity cost of gas may not be so regulated 
essentially  the transportation service which is now available to a limited number of pge s customers  would be extended to all its customers 
customers would choose the supplier of their natural gas  which could be pge  based on nonregulated market prices and other considerations 
if pennsylvania enacts legislation which permits all customers of ldcs to choose their supplier of natural gas  pge will be faced with significant competition from other gas utilities and marketers for the sale of natural gas to its customers 
however  under current regulations of the ppuc  pge does not realize a profit or incur any loss with respect to the commodity cost of natural gas 
moreover  pge would not expect the legislation to result in the bypass of its distribution system by any significant number of customers because of the nature of its customer base and the cost of any such bypass 
additionally  based on the recently enacted electric industry legislation  pge anticipates that any transition costs such as the negotiated buyout of contracts with interstate pipelines  the recovery of deferred purchased gas costs or the recovery of regulatory assets it might incur as a result of legislation providing for customer choice of natural gas suppliers would be recovered through a nonbypassable customer charge 
accordingly  although it cannot be certain  because the terms of such legislation have not been finalized and the ultimate effect on pge cannot be determined  pge does not believe that the enactment of legislation providing for customers to purchase their natural gas from third parties would have any material adverse impact on its earnings or financial condition despite the increased competition to which pge would be subject regarding the sale of natural gas to its customers 
expansion of nonregulated activities the company intends that pge  along with its affiliates  will remain a leading supplier of energy and energy related products and services even if the sale of natural gas to its customers is deregulated 
pge will actively market the sale of natural gas  and possibly other forms of energy  to its customers on a competitive  nonregulated basis and will continue to aggressively add customers to its distribution system 
additionally  the company plans to further expand the activities of pennsylvania energy resources  inc peri  a nonregulated affiliate of pge  which presently provides a broad array of energy supply and energy management services  including the marketing and sale of natural gas to commercial and industrial users in northeastern united states  the sale of propane on both a retail and wholesale level in central and northeastern pennsylvania  the inspection  maintenance and servicing of residential and small commercial gas fired equipment  and through its subsidiary  keystone pipeline services  inc keystone  specialized pipeline distribution services for utilities  including keyhole vacuum excavation  camera inspection and bridge pipeline rehabilitation  as well as the installation of mains and services for the natural gas  water and sewer industries 
in addition  the company  through its subsidiary theta land corporation theta  is presently initiating several residential and commercial development projects  including a residential development located at the montage mountain ski resort in lackawanna county  known as white cliff at montage  which will consist of townhomes and single family dwellings and a development near wilkes barre in luzerne county  known as laurel run  which will consist of a motel  restaurant  small strip shopping center and townhomes on company owned land 
theta is also developing plans to conduct timber  sand and gravel operations on the company s land and to increase the value being realized from the company s extensive land holdings through a more active management of those resources 
discontinued operations pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated april   as amended the agreement  among the company  pge  american water works company  inc american and pennsylvania american water company pennsylvania american  a wholly owned subsidiary of american  the company and pge sold substantially all of the assets  properties and rights of pge s water utility operations to pennsylvania american on february  under the terms of the agreement  pennsylvania american paid pge million consisting of million in cash and the assumption of million of pge s liabilities  including million of its long term debt 
pge continued to operate the water utility business until february  the cash proceeds from the sale of approximately million  net of an estimated million of income taxes  were used by the company and pge to retire debt  to repurchase stock  for construction expenditures and for other working capital purposes 
the sale price reflected a million premium over the book value of the assets being sold 
however  after transaction costs and the net effect of other items  the sale resulted in an after tax loss of approximately million  net of the income from the water operations during the phase out period which for financial reporting purposes was april   through february  
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company s consolidated financial statements reflect pge s water utility operations as discontinued operations effective march   and the following sections of management s discussion and analysis generally relate only to the company s continuing operations

o year ended december   compared with year ended december  operating revenues 
operating revenues increased million from million for to million for largely as a result of million of operating revenues relative to the pipeline construction and services activities of keystone  which was acquired in december   and a million increase in operating revenues relative to energy sales and services by peri 
also contributing to the increase in operating revenues was a higher level of revenues attributable to pge s gas sales and services which increased by million  primarily as a result of a billion cubic feet increase in sales to residential and commercial heating customers 
there was a increase in heating degree days from  of normal during to  of normal during the effects of the increased sales to heating customers were partially offset by lower levels in the purchased gas cost component of pge s tariffs the gas cost rate

operating expenses 
operating expenses  including depreciation and income taxes  increased million from million for to million for as a percentage of operating revenues  total operating expenses increased from during to during the cost of gas increased million from million for to million for primarily because of a million increase in the cost of gas relative to peri s gas sales and services and a million increase resulting from the aforementioned increase in sales by pge to residential and commercial heating customers  the effects of which were partially offset by lower levels in pge s gas cost rate see rate matters 
other than the cost of gas and income taxes  operating expenses increased by million from million for to million for this increase was largely attributable to a million increase in other operation expenses  primarily as a result of million of expenses relative to keystone s pipeline construction and services activities  and a million increase in expenses with respect to pge s operations  which was principally the result of higher payroll and payroll related costs 
payroll and payroll related costs increased largely because of charges  which had formerly been allocated to pge s discontinued operations  now being absorbed by its continuing operations 
also contributing to the higher operating expenses was an  increase in depreciation expense as a result of  of depreciation relative to keystone and  of depreciation attributable to additions to pge s utility plant 
income taxes increased million from million in to million in due to an increase in income before income taxes for this purpose  operating income net of interest charges

other income  net 
other income  net increased million from  for to million for largely as a result of investment income totaling million relative to the temporary investment of a portion of the proceeds from the sale of pge s regulated water utility operations 
the effects of this increase were partially offset by charges of  relative to the sale and abandonment of pge s interest in certain gas rights and properties in western pennsylvania 
interest charges 
interest charges decreased by million from million for to million for this decrease was largely attributable to the lower level of indebtedness resulting from the repayment of pge s million term loan and all of its then outstanding bank borrowings on february   with proceeds from the sale of its regulated water utility operations on such date and the company s defeasance of its senior notes on september  income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations increased million from million for to million for this increase was largely the result of the matters discussed above  principally the increase in operating revenues and other income  net and the decrease in interest charges  the effects of which were partially offset by increased operating expenses

income loss before extraordinary loss 
the increase in income before extraordinary loss of million from a loss of  for to income of million for was largely the result of the increase in income from continuing operations and the lower level of dividends on subsidiary s preferred stock  as discussed above  and the reduction of million  from million to  in the loss with respect to discontinued operations 
extraordinary loss 
on september   the company defeased the million outstanding principal amount of its senior notes  due june   and recorded an extraordinary loss of million million  net of  of related income tax benefit 
the loss on the defeasance represents the interest expense on the senior notes from the date of defeasance through june   the date on which the senior notes will be redeemed  plus the writeoff of the unamortized balance of issuance expenses related to the senior notes  less i the interest income that will be earned on the funds that were deposited with the trustee for the senior notes in connection with their defeasance and ii the related income tax benefit

per share  from 
per share for to 
per share for  in the loss with respect to discontinued operations 
o year ended december   compared with year ended december  operating revenues 
operating revenues decreased million from million for to million for this decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in pge s gas cost rate effective may  see rate matters 
also contributing to the decrease in revenues was the switching of certain of pge s commercial and industrial customers from sales to transportation service and a million cubic feet decrease in sales by pge to residential and commercial heating customers  caused by a decrease in heating degree days

operating expenses  including depreciation and income taxes  decreased million from million for to million for as a percentage of operating revenues  total operating expenses decreased from during to during the cost of gas decreased million from million for to million for  primarily because of the aforementioned reduction in pge s gas cost rate effective may  see rate matters 
also contributing to the decrease was the reduced consumption by residential and commercial heating customers 
other than the cost of gas and income taxes  operating expenses increased  from million for to million for this increase was attributable to a  increase in maintenance expenses  principally as a result of charges relative to the maintenance of gas valves  a  increase in other operation expenses and a  increase in depreciation expense as a result of additions to utility plant 
the effect of the increase was partially offset by an  decrease in taxes other than income taxes  primarily because of a decrease in gross receipts tax as a result of the lower level of operating revenues 
income taxes decreased  from million in to million in due to a decrease in income before income taxes for this purpose  operating income net of interest charges and a reduction in the pennsylvania corporate net income tax rate 
operating income 
as a result of the above  total operating income increased  from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of total operating revenues for such periods from in to in other income  net

none of the interest expense on borrowings under the company s term loan agreement or the company s senior notes was allocated to the discontinued operations 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations decreased million from million for to million for this decrease was largely the result of the matters discussed above  principally the decrease in operating margin resulting from the lower level of sales by pge to residential and commercial heating customers 
the effect of the decreased operating margin was partially offset by the lower levels of taxes 
subsidiary s preferred stock dividends 
dividends on preferred stock decreased million from million for to million for  as a result of the redemption by pge on may   of  shares million of its cumulative preferred stock  par value  and on december   of  shares million of its cumulative preferred stock  par value

per share charge for the premium on redemption of subsidiary s preferred stock to a loss of 
per share for  were largely the result of the estimated loss equivalent to 
per share on the sale of pge s water utility operations  as discussed above 
also contributing to the decreases in net income and earnings per share for was the lower income from continuing operations 
the effects of these factors were partially offset by the reduced dividends on subsidiary s preferred stock and  in the case of earnings per share  the absence of any premium on the redemption of subsidiary s preferred stock 
rate matters rate increase 
on may   pge filed an application with the ppuc seeking an increase in its base gas rates  designed to produce million in additional annual revenue  to be effective july  on june   the ppuc suspended this rate increase for seven months until february  in order to investigate the reasonableness of the proposed rates 
on november   pge and certain parties filing objections to the rate increase request filed a settlement agreement and joint petition for settlement of rate investigation the settlement petition with the administrative law judge assigned to conduct the investigation of the rate increase request 
this settlement petition provided for an overall rate increase that was designed to produce million of additional annual revenue 
by order adopted december   the ppuc approved the settlement petition effective january  under the terms of the settlement petition  the billing for the impact of the rate increase relative to pge s residential heating customers which it is estimated will total million on an annual basis is being deferred  without carrying charges  until july  gas cost adjustments 
the provisions of the pennsylvania public utility code require that the tariffs of ldcs such as pge  be adjusted on an annual basis  and on an interim basis when circumstances dictate  to reflect changes in their purchased gas costs 
the procedure includes a process for the reconciliation of actual gas costs incurred and actual revenues received and also provides for the refund of any overcollections  plus interest thereon  or the recoupment of any undercollections of gas costs 
the procedure is limited to purchased gas costs  to the exclusion of other rate matters  and requires a formal evidentiary proceeding conducted by the ppuc  the submission of specific information regarding gas procurement practices and specific findings of fact by the ppuc regarding the least cost fuel procurement policies of the utility 
effective september   the ppuc adopted regulations that provide for the quarterly adjustment of the annual purchased gas cost rate of larger ldcs  including pge 
such quarterly adjustments are allowed when the actual costs vary from the costs reflected in the respective company s tariffs by or more 
except for reducing the amount of any over or undercollections of gas costs  these regulations will not have any material effect on pge s financial position or results of operations  and pge is still required to file an annual purchased gas cost rate 
in accordance with these annual and quarterly procedures  pge has been permitted to make the following changes since january   to the gas costs contained in its gas tariff rates

recovery of ferc order transition costs 
on october   the ppuc adopted an annual purchased gas cost pgc order the pgc order regarding recovery of federal energy regulatory commission ferc order transition costs 
the pgc order stated that account and new facility costs the gas transition costs are subject to recovery through the annual pgc rate filings made with the ppuc by pge and other larger ldcs 
the pgc order also indicated that while gas supply realignment and stranded costs the non gas transition costs are not natural gas costs eligible for recovery under the pgc rate filing mechanism  such costs are subject to full recovery by ldcs through the filing of a tariff pursuant to either the existing surcharge or base rate provisions of the code 
the pgc order further stated that all such filings would be evaluated on a case by case basis 
pge was billed a total of million of gas transition costs by its interstate pipelines 
of this amount   was recovered by pge over a twelve month period ended january   through an increase in its pgc rate   was recovered by pge in its annual pgc rate that the ppuc approved effective december   and the remaining  is being recovered by pge in its pgc rate that was effective december  by order of the ppuc entered august   pge began recovering the non gas transition costs that it estimates it will ultimately be billed pursuant to ferc order through the billing of a surcharge to its customers effective september  it is currently estimated that million of non gas transition costs will be billed to pge  generally over a six year period extending through january   of which million had been billed to pge and million had been recovered from its customers as of december  pge has recorded the estimated non gas transition costs that remain to be billed to it and the amounts remaining to be recovered from its customers 
effects of inflation 
when utility property reaches the end of its useful life and must be replaced  pge will incur replacement costs in amounts that due to the effects of inflation would materially exceed either the original cost or the accrued depreciation of such property as reflected on its books of account 
however  the cost of such replacement property would be includable in pge s rate base  and pge would be entitled to recover depreciation expense and earn a return thereon  to the extent that its investment in such property was prudently incurred and the property is used and useful in furnishing public utility service 
liquidity and capital resources sale of water utility operations on february   pge sold its regulated water operations and certain related assets to pennsylvania american for million  consisting of million in cash and the assumption of million of pge s liabilities  including million of its long term debt 
the company and pge used the million of cash proceeds from the sale  after an estimated million of federal and state income taxes of which million had been paid as of december   to retire debt  to repurchase stock  for construction expenditures and for other working capital purposes 
in this regard  pge repaid its million term loan due and all of its then outstanding bank borrowings on february   and the company and pge temporarily invested the balance of the proceeds 
a portion of these proceeds were subsequently used by the company to repurchase  shares of its common stock during for an aggregate consideration of million  of which  shares were acquired in april pursuant to a self tender offer and  shares were acquired from time to time through open market transactions and an oddlot buyback program 
also during and using proceeds from the sale  pge repurchased  shares of its cumulative preferred stock for an aggregate consideration of million and  shares of its cumulative preferred stock for an aggregate consideration of million  largely pursuant to self tender offers conducted during march and april  additionally  on june   pge repurchased  shares of its cumulative preferred stock including shares redeemed in accordance with annual sinking fund provisions for an aggregate consideration of  as of december   the only unexpended proceeds from the sale were million which the company had temporarily lent to pge for its working capital needs 
liquidity the primary capital needs of the company continue to be the funding of pge s construction program and the seasonal funding of pge s gas purchases and increases in its customer accounts receivable 
pge s revenues are highly seasonal and weather sensitive  with approximately of its revenues normally being realized in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year when the temperatures in its service area are the coldest 
additionally  as the company s nonregulated activities expand  capital will be required for those activities  especially the residential and commercial real estate development projects that are planned for certain company owned land 
the projects that are currently planned by the company are in the initial planning and design phases  and the amount and type of funding that those projects will require has not yet been finalized 
however  it is currently anticipated that approximately million will be expended with respect to those projects in and that such expenditures will be funded by a combination of capital provided by the company  bank borrowings and other debt financing 
the cash flow from pge s operations is generally sufficient to fund a portion of its construction expenditures 
however  to the extent external financing is required  it is the practice of pge to use bank borrowings to fund such expenditures  pending the periodic issuance of stock and long term debt 
bank borrowings are also used by pge for the seasonal funding of its gas purchases and increases in customer accounts receivable 
with the repayment of its term loan and all its bank borrowings on february   and the availability of cash proceeds from the sale of its regulated water operations  pge terminated its million bank credit agreement 
however  in order to finance construction expenditures and to meet its seasonal borrowing requirements  pge has since made arrangements for a total of million of unsecured revolving bank credit  which is deemed adequate for its immediate needs 
specifically  pge currently has six bank lines of credit with an aggregate borrowing capacity of million which provide for borrowings at interest rates generally less than prime and which mature during mid as of march   pge had million of borrowings outstanding under these bank lines of credit 
the company believes that pge will be able to raise in a timely manner such funds as are required for its future construction expenditures  refinancings and other working capital requirements 
likewise  the company believes that its nonregulated subsidiaries will be able to raise such funds as are required for their needs  including that required for the residential and commercial real estate development that is planned 
long term debt and capital stock financings both the company and its subsidiaries  particularly pge  periodically engage in long term debt and capital stock financings in order to obtain funds required for construction expenditures  the refinancing of existing debt and various working capital purposes 
set forth below is a summary of such financings consummated since the beginning of  exclusive of interim bank borrowings and indebtedness that was assumed by pennsylvania american in connection with its purchase of pge s water utility operations

the company also obtains external funds from the sale of its common stock through its dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan the drp  its stock option plan and its employees savings plan 
however  from june   through december   the company temporarily suspended the sale of newly issued stock to both the drp and employees savings plan as a result of the proceeds received from the sale of pge s water utility operations  and during that period the two plans obtained shares of company common stock for participants through open market purchases 
effective january   the company resumed selling newly issued stock to both the drp and employees savings plan

capital expenditures are currently expected to range from million in each of the years and  of which million will involve utility plant and the balance will relate to the company s nonregulated activities  primarily residential and commercial real estate development projects 
it is anticipated that such capital expenditures will be financed with internally generated funds and bank borrowings  and to the extent necessary by the periodic issuance of stock and long term debt
