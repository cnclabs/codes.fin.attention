the company s increased production costs stemmed from low bulk wine conversion rates and bottling inefficiencies 
the company also experienced high imported concentrate and bulk freight costs 
the company has instituted a series of steps to address these matters  including a reengineering effort to redesign its work processes  organizational structure and information systems
