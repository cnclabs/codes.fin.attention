item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general highwaymaster operates a wireless  enhanced services network with both voice and data capabilities in of the available cellular coverage in the united states and of the a side cellular coverage in canada 
this network covers approximately of the united states interstate highway system and consists of a unique integration of company provided on board equipment and software with various transmission  long distance  switching  tracking and other services and facilities provided by certain telecommunications companies and more than cellular carriers 
through this private network  the company provides integrated mobile voice  data  tracking  and fleet management information services to trucking fleets and other operators in the long haul segment of the transportation industry 
the company commenced operations in april and has a limited operating history 
the company began offering the highwaymaster system on a commercial basis in september in order to achieve a profitable level of operations  the company must significantly increase its installed base of mobile communications units and generate substantially greater service revenues 
the likelihood of the long term success of the company must be considered in light of the expenses  difficulties and delays frequently encountered in connection with the early stages of the development and marketing of telecommunications products and services  as well as the competitive environment in which the company operates 
there can be no assurance that the company s future operations will generate operating or net income 
see risk factors limited operating history  history of losses 
the company s revenues are derived from sales and installation of mobile communication units and charges for its services 
the company currently offers its mobile communication units to customers at a retail price of approximately  per unit  with tiered discounts for larger volume purchases 
customers that operate units installed in their trucks are charged i a flat fee of per minute for all voice calls for communications within the united states and per minute for cross border communications with units in canada  and ii a flat fee of per minute for all data transmissions within the united states and per minute for cross border data transmissions 
such flat fees include all cellular air time rates and long distance charges 
in addition  callers are charged a fee for each call billed to a separate account  such as a credit card  calling card or highwaymaster account 
in the case of customers served through the nsc  placed into service by the company in the third quarter of  the company retains and recognizes as revenue the full amount of these service charges  but must bear all costs associated with providing the related services 
in the case of customers served through the at t complex  these service charges are collected by at t 
the company receives payment from at t for the portion of these service charges recognized by the company as revenue and the remainder is retained by at t as compensation for the call processing  enhanced long distance and customer collection services performed by at t 
the company also assesses a fixed monthly service fee of for each unit installed 
the company and at t were parties to the at t contract under which at t provided enhanced call processing  data management services and long distance network transport services through the at t complex 
the at t contract was terminated by at t effective june  however  at t continues to provide services for certain company customers without a formal contract with the comapny pursuant to at t s obligations with respect to its existing service agreements with such customers 
see risk factors status of at t contract  network services center and at t litigation 
in the third quarter of  the company placed into service the nsc 
the nsc provides enhanced call processing services that were previously provided on an exclusive basis by at t 
all new customers of the company are provided services through the nsc 
accordingly  the company provides customer billing  credit  and collection activities with respect to those customers 
existing customers who are currently being provided services by at t are eligible to begin receiving service provided through the nsc upon the expiration of their respective joint service agreements 
the company generally recognizes revenue from the sale of mobile communication units at the time the units are shipped to customers 
however  in some cases  the company has installed units in customers trucks on a trial basis  permitting customers to return such units with limited or no penalty 
in such cases  the company does not recognize revenue from the sale of the units until the trial period has expired 
the principal components of cost of revenues are the cost of the mobile communication unit  warranty and obsolescence provisions  cost of installation  charges for the cost of cellular air time used by the unit which charges are paid by gte mobilecomm to cellular carriers and reimbursed by the company  charges by gte tsi and eds for the cost of validation and call delivery information from the mobile communication unit and the cost of installation of the mobile communication unit 
as of december   the company had installed  mobile communication units including units installed on a test basis and had orders to install an additional  units including approximately  units to be installed upon successful completion of test programs 
not included in these orders are approximately  units that may be ordered by wal mart stores inc in the event of the successful completion of their test currently underway on units 
in comparison  the company had installed  units at december  the company s order backlog is based on signed contracts  which do not specify delivery dates 
accordingly  in some cases the timing of installation is uncertain  and the company expects that not all of the units on order at december  will be shipped and installed within the next twelve months 
the company leases its products to certain customers under contracts that are accounted for as sales type leases 
as of december   the company s balance sheet reflected a total receivable balance of approximately  related to such leases 
in march  a customer who represents  of the total receivable balance notified the company that it intended to terminate its long term lease commitment 
although the lease agreement contains termination penalties  the company believes that it may be necessary to write off a portion of the receivable as a result of the lease termination 
the company estimates that the amount of the write off may range from approximately  to  although the company is continuing to evaluate its position under the lease and no final decision has been reached 
any write off of a portion of the receivable would be reflected as a charge to results of operations in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for were million compared to million for product revenues for were million compared to million for the principal reason for the decrease in product revenues from to is a decrease in the number of mobile communication units sold 
the decrease in units sold was due to  among other things  i prospective customers postponing their decision to purchase until they were comfortable that the company could deliver service through the nsc  ii prospective customers concerns about the company s financial condition and iii adverse economic conditions affecting the trucking industry 
service revenues for were million compared to million for the increase in service revenues in is primarily attributable to the increase in the number of mobile communication units in service 
cost of revenues for was million compared to million for this relationship reflects the decrease in the number of units sold in compared to offset by increased cost of service revenues in as a result of the increase in the number of mobile communication units in service 
cost of revenues for was exclusive of the inventory write down of revenues compared to of revenues for cost of revenues for included a million inventory write down to adjust the carrying value of used earlier generation mobile unit component parts inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
cost of product revenues for was exclusive of the inventory write down of product revenues compared to of revenues for excluding the effect of the inventory write down  product margin improved as a result of higher average selling prices and lower average cost per unit in as compared to however  this margin improvement was offset by costs incurred on the earlier generation mobile communication units in order to make them compatible with the nsc and costs of upgrading earlier generation mobile communication units 
cost of service revenues for was of service revenues compared to of service revenues in the period 
the improvement from to is primarily due to i the effect of lower costs as a result of renegotiated rates with the company s service providers that were in effect during and ii improvement in the company s ability to monitor and control charges for air time usage 
general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million for the increase from to is primarily attributable to rent expense  depreciation expense  and professional fees 
rent expense increased as a result of i additional office space and equipment under lease due to the growth in the number of employees from at the end of to at the end of and ii increased cost per square foot in the lease agreement for the company s office space 
depreciation expense increased as a result of additions to machinery and equipment  computers and office equipment  and the nsc which was placed in service during the third quarter of the increase in professional fees was primarily due to legal fees in connection with the at t and shareholder suit litigation 
sales and marketing expenses for were million compared to million for the increase from to is primarily related to growth in the number of employees 
engineering expenses for were million compared to million for the increase is primarily attributable to increases in payroll related costs  and operating expenses for the nsc 
customer service expenses for were million compared to million for the increase from to is primarily attributable to i payroll related costs as a result of growth in the number of employees  ii customer support costs in response to the increased number of units in service  and iii concessions granted on amounts owed by a major customer that was downsizing its fleet 
interest income was million in compared to million in the decrease from to reflects the lower average cash balances available for temporary investments 
interest expense to related parties was million in compared to million in the decrease from to reflects the lower average outstanding indebtedness 
the and extraordinary item  loss on extinguishment of debt  represents the write off of the unamortized balances of debt discount and debt issue costs associated with the early retirement of notes payable to related parties

year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for were million compared to million for product revenues for were million compared to million for service revenues for were million compared to million for the increase in product revenues and service revenues in the period is primarily attributable to the increase in the number of mobile communication units sold and in service  respectively 
cost of revenues for was million compared to million for this increase is consistent with the number of units sold and in service 
cost of revenues for was of revenues compared to exclusive of the inventory write down of revenues for cost of revenues for included a million inventory write down for loran c radio receivers reflecting the company s decision to change to the use of gps satellite receivers in its units 
cost of product revenues for was of product revenues compared to exclusive of the inventory write down of revenues for cost of revenues from products exceeded revenues from products during both years for several reasons  including higher costs associated with manufacturing small quantities and being unable to take advantage of economies of scale  initial implementation of a product installation infrastructure with excess capacity to support anticipated increases in sales  and equipment price discounts to certain early customers 
although revenues from services exceeded cost of revenues from services during both the and periods  results for both periods have been affected by i technical difficulties with the at t complex and ii differences between the billing procedures of cellular carriers and the company  which resulted in the company paying cellular carriers for more minutes of cellular air time than were billed to the company s customers 
general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million for during  the company s general and administrative functions were increased to meet the growth in revenues as well as for the additional administrative requirements of a public company 
accordingly  virtually all categories of expenses increased primarily as a result of the growth in the number of employees from at the end of to at the end of the most significant increases  aggregating approximately million  were payroll related costs  occupancy costs and insurance 
these increases were partially offset by decreases  in the aggregate amount of million  as a result of reductions from the amounts for amortization expense related to the deferred debt issue costs see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  bad debt expense see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  and professional fees 
sales and marketing expenses for were million compared to million for the increase from to period is related to increases in advertising and promotion of the mobile communication units  the creation of a distribution network for sales of units and growth in the number of employees 
engineering expenses for were million compared to million for this increase is primarily attributable to payroll related costs as a result of both growth in the number of employees and outside contractors from to to enable the company to design and develop the second generation of the highwaymaster mobile communication unit while maintaining and enhancing its system software 
customer service expenses for were million compared to million for this increase is primarily attributable to i payroll related costs as a result of both growth in the number of employees and outside contractors and ii customer support costs in response to the increased number of units sold and in service 
the changes in interest income and interest expense to related parties between and reflects the income from temporary investments made with a portion of the proceeds from the initial public offering and lower average outstanding indebtedness in the period as a result of the debt repayments made with a portion of the proceeds from the initial public offering 
recapitalization costs in the amount of million for the period were expended in connection with the recapitalization 
liquidity and capital resources as more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  on september   the company i issued series d preferred stock to a new investor for cash of million and issued warrants to purchase million shares of common stock  ii issued  shares of common stock to certain existing stockholders in exchange for cash of million  and iii issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock in exchange for the cancellation of notes payable to related parties in the aggregate principal amount of  and cancellation of all outstanding shares of series b preferred stock of the company 
the effect of these transactions was to increase cash by  net of offering costs  to eliminate all outstanding indebtedness of the company and to increase stockholders equity by approximately million 
the company s business historically has not required substantial capital expenditures 
however  during the company completed and placed into service the new nsc at a cost of million 
at december  the company is committed to build another switching complex the additional complex in connection with its contract with prince for the autolink product offering 
construction of the additional complex is scheduled for the fourth quarter of at a cost estimated to range from to million 
in the event the company elects to expand its local service business or to pursue other business opportunities  the company will need to build additional complexes 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million due primarily to a net loss of million 
at december  the company had cash on hand of million and working capital of million 
based on the company s projected operating results  the company believes that it is likely that it will need to secure additional equity or debt financing during in order to fund its currently anticipated operating needs and capital expenditure requirements 
the amount and timing of the additional financing that will be required depends upon  among other things  the company s cash flow from operations  which may vary depending on a number of factors  including the rate of installation of mobile communication units  the level of competition and general economic conditions and other factors beyond the company s control 
the company is actively evaluating its alternatives with respect to obtaining additional equity or debt financing  although  at the present time  the company does not have any commitments in place 
while the company believes there are alternative sources of financing available  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate a financing arrangement on terms that would be satisfactory 
inflation the company believes that to date inflation has not had a material effect on its results of operations 
although inflation may in the future affect the cost of the mobile communication units sold by the company  the company expects that economies of scale and engineering improvements are likely to offset any foreseeable cost increases
