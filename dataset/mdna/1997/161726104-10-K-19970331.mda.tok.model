other funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property plus rental property depreciation and amortization 
management believes that ffo is an important and widely used measure of the operating performance of reit s which provides a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
for all periods presented  depreciation of rental property is the only non cash adjustment 
ffo i does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  ii should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  and iii is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is calculated as follows for the year ended december  income before extraordinary item    depreciation of rental property    funds from operations    on a pro forma basis  ffo is calculated as follows for the year ended december  income before minority interest   depreciation of rental property   amortization of other intangibles funds from operations
