item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations the discussion below contains certain forward looking statements relating to  among other things  estimates of economic and industry conditions  sales trends  expense levels and capital expenditures 
actual results may vary from those contained in such forward looking statements 
see business environment and risk factors below 
results of operations this table sets forth cabletron s net sales  cost of sales  expenses by category  income from operations  interest income  income before income taxes and net income expressed as percentages of net sales  for the fiscal years ended february   february  and february  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative nonrecurring items income from operations interest income income before income taxes net income acquisitions during fiscal the company augmented its product line and expanded its markets by acquiring zeitnet inc  a manufacturer of atm products  in july  network express  inc  a manufacturer of remote access equipment  in august  netlink  inc  a manufacturer of frame relay products  in december  and the oasys group  inc  a software developer  in february the nonrecurring charges related to these acquisitions were million net of tax 
excluding these one time charges  fiscal net income would have been million or per share 
during fiscal the company acquired the enterprise networks business unit from standard microsystems corporation in january the acquisition added a line of fast ethernet products  as well as switching products for token ring  ethernet and fddi 
for fiscal net income would have been million or per share before acquisition related expenses of million net of tax 
revenues net sales in fiscal increased by  to  million  from  million in fiscal  a increase from million in fiscal the increases in revenues in fiscal years  and were primarily the result of increases in sales of the mmac plus and the mmac and in fiscal  the smartswitch product lines 
net sales outside the united states in fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales in fiscal and million or of net sales in fiscal in addition to its direct international sales force  the company sells its products through several international distributors 
management anticipates that foreign shipments will continue to increase in absolute dollars during the coming fiscal year 
the company currently has foreign subsidiaries throughout the world 
the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on operations was not significant in fiscal during fiscal  growth in net sales was attributed to the smartswitch and the mmac plus product lines and other switching products  small stackable hubs and spectrum  the company s network management software 
during fiscal  mmac plus  token ring management interface modules for the mmac and the mmac plus  small stackable hubs  bridges and routers  and network management spectrum accounted for the largest sales growth within the network interconnection products 
during fiscal  the mmac  including token ring modules  spectrum and other network management software  accounted for the largest sales growth within the network interconnection products 
net sales of diagnostic test instruments  installation and maintenance services  and other products were million or of net sales in fiscal  compared to million or of net sales in fiscal and million or of net sales in fiscal sales of diagnostic test instruments are on a downward trend due to greater functionality being incorporated into more intelligent devices 
management anticipates diagnostic test instruments to decrease as a percentage of sales in the next fiscal year 
installation and maintenance services are an integral part of cabletron s customer development and support activities 
management anticipates that sales of such services and other products could increase in absolute sales dollars in the future year 
costs  expenses and interest income cost of sales was million or of net sales in fiscal  compared to million or of net sales in fiscal and million or of net sales in fiscal the company was able to maintain its gross margins in fiscal  and by introducing and selling products with improved functionality  further developing its service maintenance program and improving purchasing and manufacturing efficiencies 
research and development r d expenses in fiscal increased to million or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales in fiscal in fiscal  r d expenses were million or of net sales 
the increased r d spending in fiscal reflected increased hiring of software and hardware engineers  the addition of engineers through acquisitions and associated costs related to the development of new products 
the increased expenditures in r d over the past three fiscal years in both absolute spending and as a percentage of sales are indicative of the commitment the company has made to remain in the forefront of developing new and innovative products for the networking industry  as exemplified by the company s smartswitch family of products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal  compared to million or of net sales in fiscal and million or of net sales in fiscal increases in sg a spending resulted from expanding the sales and support workforce  establishing additional office locations domestically and internationally  the addition of administrative personnel as a result of acquisitions and increased administrative spending primarily due to increases in volume 
for fiscal a million nonrecurring charge was taken for the acquisitions of zeitnet  network express  netlink and the oasys group 
in fiscal a million nonrecurring charge was taken for the purchase of the enbu of smc and fivemere limited purchased by network express in fiscal 
interest income in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in interest income reflects increased cash and marketable securities acquired from favorable operating results 
income income before income taxes was million or of net sales in fiscal  compared to million or of net sales in fiscal and million or of net sales in fiscal in fiscal the company s nonrecurring charges related to acquisitions was million as compared to million in fiscal as a consequence  the increase in income before income taxes in fiscal  was in part due to the million decrease in nonrecurring charges 
the decrease in income before income taxes  in fiscal  as a percentage of sales  was due primarily to expenses related to the acquisition of the enbu of smc and fivemere network express 
the tax rate for fiscal was  a decrease from a tax rate of for fiscal  which was due to tax loss carryforwards of the acquired aforementioned acquisitions 
net income was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal excluding the above nonrecurring charges for fiscal and the company would have realized net income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  were million at february  or days of sales outstanding  compared to million or days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable at february  this increase in receivables reflects timing on shipments and collections 
these trends are expected to continue for the intermediate term 
the company has historically maintained higher levels of inventory than its competitors in the networking industry in order to implement its policy of shipping most orders requiring immediate delivery within to hours 
worldwide inventories were million at february  or days of inventory  compared to million or days of inventory at the end of the preceding fiscal year 
the decrease of days in inventory was the result of improving inventory control procedures 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal of million included million for the engineering computer hardware and software and million for leasehold improvements 
during fiscal  million of capital expenditures included million for building costs of which million was for the purchase of an engineering building  million for engineering computer hardware and software  million for manufacturing and related equipment and million for expanding global sales operations 
during fiscal  capital expenditures of million included approximately million for building costs related to expanding manufacturing and distribution capacities and enlarging worldwide sales operations  million for manufacturing and manufacturing support equipment and million for engineering hardware and software  and million in support of expanded global sales activities 
cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments increased during fiscal to million  from million in the prior fiscal year 
state and local municipal bonds of approximately million  maturing in three years or less  were being held by the company at february  at february   the company did not have any short or long term borrowing or any significant financial commitments outstanding  other than those required in the normal course of business 
on march  the company obtained a million revolving credit facility with chase manhattan bank  first national bank of chicago and several other lenders 
the facility has a term of three years but the company has the option to extend the facility for an additional two years 
as of may  the company had not drawn down any money under the facility 
in the opinion of management  internally generated funds from operations and existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to support cabletron s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for both short and long term needs 
business environment and risk factors the following are cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company may occasionally make forward looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of the company s future performance or statements of management s plans and objectives 
these forward looking statements may be contained in  among other things  sec filings and press releases made by the company and in oral statements made by the officers of the company 
actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
therefore  no assurances can be given that the results in such forward looking statements will be achieved 
important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ from those contained in such forward looking statements include  among others  the factors mentioned below 
cabletron s primary competitors have recently acquired several other networking companies possessing complementary technologies  and cabletron expects that such acquisitions will continue in the future 
the acquisition of these technologies may allow cabletron s primary competitors to offer new products without the lengthy time delays typically associated with internal product development 
as a consequence  such competitors may be able to more swiftly meet the growing demand for so called end to end enterprise wide networking solutions 
with such increased competition  cabletron anticipates an increase in the degree of sales variability and a decreased ability to predict aggregate sales demand 
certain of these acquisitions may also have the effect of limiting cabletron s access to commercially significant technologies 
the greater resources of the competitors engaged in these acquisitions may permit them to accelerate the development and commercialization of new competitive products and the marketing of existing competitive products to their larger installed bases 
cabletron expects that competition will increase substantially as a result of these and other industry consolidations 
in the past  cabletron has relied upon a combination of internal product development and partnerships with other networking vendors to broaden its product line to meet this demand for end to end enterprise wide solutions 
the increasing competitiveness among vendors  together with acquisitions by cabletron and its competitors of smaller networking companies possessing complementary technologies  may materially limit cabletron s ability to continue to partner with other vendors for new or complementary products 
in the future  cabletron expects to meet the demand for a broad array of products primarily through internal development and acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that cabletron will be successful in developing or acquiring products that will meet customers needs 
volatility of stock price 
as is frequently the case with the stocks of high technology companies  the market price of cabletron s stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  increased competition  the introduction of new products by cabletron or its competitors  expenses or other difficulties associated with assimilating oasys  netlink  network express  zeitnet and other companies that may be acquired in the future by cabletron  changes in the mix of sales channels  the timing of significant customer orders the average dollar amount of customer orders has increased in recent periods  and macroeconomic conditions generally  may have a significant impact on the market price of the stock of cabletron 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have appeared to be unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from the levels anticipated by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of cabletron s stock in any given period 
fluctuations in operating results 
a variety of factors may cause period to period fluctuations in the operating results of cabletron 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the rate of growth of the market for the company s products  product mix  competitive pricing pressures  costs of materials  and timely availability  revenue and expenses related to new products  upgrades of existing products  as well as delays in customer purchases and variability in overall customer purchasing patterns 
further  because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules  cancellation of orders  purchasing patterns or inventory levels  backlog as of any particular date is not indicative of future revenue 
in particular  cabletron has been experiencing longer sales cycles for its core products as a result of the increasing dollar amount of customer orders and longer customer planning cycles 
in addition  the increase in the average dollar amount of customer orders has increased the possibility that the operating results for a quarter could be materially adversely affected if a number of large customer orders are either not received or are delayed  due  for example  to cancellations  delays or deferrals by customers 
cabletron plans to continue to invest in research and development  sales and marketing and technical support staff  and its earnings could be adversely affected if it is unable to match spending to revenue levels 
moreover  with industry standards established and new standards emerging  more companies have developed standards based products and are seeking to compete on the basis of price 
if cabletron does not respond with lower production costs  pricing pressures could adversely affect future earnings 
accordingly  past results may not be indicative of future results 
there can be no assurance that the announcement or introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  or a change in industry standards  will not cause customers to defer or cancel purchases of the company s existing products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the market of the company s products is evolving 
the rate of growth of the market and the resulting demand for the company s recently introduced products is subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the rate of growth in the market in recent periods has exceeded the long term historical rate of growth in similar markets 
if the market fails to grow or grows more slowly than anticipated  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
technological changes 
the market for networking products is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions  and therefore requires a high level of expenditures for research and development 
cabletron may be required to incur significant expenditures to develop such new integrated product offerings 
there can be no assurance that customer demand for products integrating routing  switching  hub  network management and remote access technologies will grow at the rate expected by cabletron  that cabletron will be successful in developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or product enhancements that respond to these customer demands or to evolving industry standards and technological change  that cabletron will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction  manufacture and marketing of these products especially in light of the increasing design and manufacturing complexities associated with the integration of technologies  or that its new product and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
cabletron s business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected if cabletron encounters delays in developing or introducing new products or product enhancements or if such product enhancements do not gain market acceptance 
in order to maintain a competitive position  cabletron must also continue to enhance its existing products and there is no assurance that it will be able to do so 
in addition  the demand for traditional shared media hubs such as the company s basic mmac product have been experiencing declines over the last few years  and there can be no assurance that such decline will not accelerate 
a portion of future revenues will come from new products and services 
cabletron cannot determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its revenues  earnings or stock price 
acquisition strategy 
cabletron has addressed the need to develop new products  in part  through the acquisition of other companies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which cabletron has no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
achieving the anticipated benefits of an acquisition will depend in part upon whether the integration of the companies businesses is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner  and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the successful combination of companies in the high technology industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries 
the combination of such companies will require  among other things  integration of the companies respective product offerings and coordination of their sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
there can be no assurance that such integration will be accomplished smoothly or successfully 
the difficulties of such integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations 
the integration of certain operations following an acquisition will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily distract attention from the day to day business of cabletron 
the inability of management to successfully integrate the operations of such companies could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of cabletron 
in addition  as commonly occurs with mergers of technology companies  during the pre merger and integration phases  aggressive competitors may undertake formal initiatives to attract customers and to recruit key employees through various incentives 
dependence on key personnel and management of change 
cabletron s success depends upon the continued contributions of craig r 
benson  chairman and chief operating officer  s 
robert levine  president and chief executive officer  christopher j 
oliver  director of engineering and manufacturing  and certain other key personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
if these key personnel were to leave cabletron  operating results could be adversely affected 
the success of cabletron will depend on the ability of cabletron to attract and retain skilled employees  and on the ability of its officers and key employees to manage change successfully 
product protection and intellectual property 
cabletron s success depends in part on its proprietary technology 
cabletron attempts to protect its proprietary technology through patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and license agreements 
cabletron believes  however  that its success will depend to a greater extent upon innovation  technological expertise and distribution strength 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by cabletron in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or that cabletron s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to cabletron s technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect cabletron s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
no assurance can be given that any patents issued to cabletron will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages 
although cabletron does not believe that its products infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  third parties have asserted infringement and other claims against cabletron from time to time  and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert such claims against cabletron in the future or that such claims will not be successful 
patents have been granted recently on fundamental technologies incorporated in cabletron s products 
since patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent issues  applications may have been filed by third parties which  if issued as patents  could relate to cabletron s products 
in addition  participants in cabletron s industry also rely upon trade secret law 
cabletron could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources with respect to the defense of any claims relating to proprietary rights which could have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  parties making such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block cabletron s ability to license its products in the united states or abroad 
such a judgment could have a material adverse effect on cabletron s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on suppliers 
cabletron s products include certain components  including application specific integrated circuits asics  that are currently available from single or limited sources  some of which require long order lead times 
in addition  certain of cabletron s products and subassemblies are manufactured by single source third parties 
with the increasing technological sophistication of new products and the associated design and manufacturing complexities  cabletron anticipates that it may need to rely on additional single source or limited suppliers for components or manufacture of products and subassemblies 
any reduction in supply  interruption or extended delay in timely supply  variances in actual needs from forecasts for long order lead time components  or change in costs of components could affect cabletron s ability to deliver its products in a timely and cost effective manner and may adversely impact cabletron s operating results and supplier relationships 
new accounting pronouncements the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
as permitted by sfas  the company will continue to measure its compensation cost in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
therefore  the adoption of sfas was not material to the company s financial condition or results of operations  however  the proforma impact on earnings per share has been disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements as required by sfas in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share sfas 
sfas establishes a different method of computing net income per share than is currently required under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
under sfas  the company will be required to present both basic net income per share and diluted net income per share 
the impact on diluted net income per share is not expected to be material 
the company plans to adopt sfas in its fiscal quarter ending february  and at that time all historical net income per share data will be restated to conform to the provisions of sfas no
