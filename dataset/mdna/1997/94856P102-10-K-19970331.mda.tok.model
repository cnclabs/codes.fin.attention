the credit facility may be used to  among other things  meet the company s operational obligations and annual reit dividend requirements 
the company currently intends to finance its development  construction and acquisition activities primarily through borrowings under the credit facility 
at december   the company had available capacity under the credit facility of approximately million see note to the consolidated and combined financial statements 
the credit facility has an initial term through december   and provides for annual extensions through december  on november   the company closed the initial phase of its announced acquisition transaction with nwi see note to the consolidated and combined financial statements

the weighted average interest rate under the fixed swap arrangements is approximately 
if interest rates under the credit facility  in excess of the million discussed above  and under the company s variable rate mortgage debt fluctuated by  interest costs to the company  based on outstanding borrowings at december   would increase or decrease by approximately  on an annualized basis

supplemental disclosure of funds from operations the company believes that funds from operations provides an additional indicator of the financial performance of the company 
funds from operations is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit to mean net income loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
funds from operations is influenced not only by the operations of the properties  but also by the capital structure of the company 
accordingly  management expects that funds from operations will be one of the factors considered by the board of directors in determining the amount of cash dividends the company will pay to its shareholders 
funds from operations does not represent cash flow from operating  investing and financing activities as defined by gaap  which are discussed under liquidity and capital resources above 
additionally  funds from operations does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash flow needs  including principal amortization  capital expenditures and dividends to shareholders  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow  as defined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity 
effective for the year ended december   the company implemented the new guidelines issued by nareit for calculating funds from operations 
the primary difference between the company s funds from operations under the new guidelines and prior years is that the company now reduces reported funds from operations for the amortization of deferred financing costs and recognizes rental income for the purposes of computing funds from operations on a straight line basis 
the amortization of deferred financing costs totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the straight line rental adjustment increased rental revenues by  for the year ended december  and decreased rental revenue by  for the year ended december  all funds from operations information detailed and discussed below relating to the year ended december  has been restated to reflect these differences 
funds from operations presented herein under the new nareit guidelines is not necessarily comparable to funds from operations presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies calculate funds from operations in the same manner 
however  the company s funds from operations is comparable to the funds from operations of real estate companies that use the current nareit definition

reflects aggregate development and leasing costs  exclusive of the decrease in construction payables of  in and the increase in construction payables of  in in  revenue producing building improvements included  in building improvements to convert a  square foot single tenant office building to a multi tenant facility 
by dividing the space for lease to a number of tenants  rather than leasing the entire building to a single tenant  the company believes it has achieved higher rents and has substantially reduced its rollover risk and potential loss due to vacancy 
also in  the company invested approximately million in building improvements to convert a  square foot bulk warehouse building to a manufacturing facility 
the new tenant also invested a similar amount in improvements to the building 
management believes that this combined investment has enhanced the value of the building and that the company has achieved higher rent as a result of the renovation and conversion of this building 
the amount includes  of tenant improvement and leasing costs to re tenant the company s  square foot office building discussed in footnote above which was vacated in february by matsushita electric corporation panasonic 
includes second generation leasing costs totaling  and  in and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for stock based compensation was issued prescribing new fair value based accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas required the company  in  to elect to utilize the fair value method under sfas or continue its current generally accepted accounting under the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
the company elected to continue to account for stock based compensation under apb no 
and implemented the additional disclosure requirements of sfas  including pro forma net income and earnings per share amounts  in its financial statements see note to the consolidated and combined financial statements 
impact of inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate 
substantially all tenant leases do  however  contain provisions designed to protect the company from the impact of inflation 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay a share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than seven years which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rentals if rents under the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
however  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rentals
