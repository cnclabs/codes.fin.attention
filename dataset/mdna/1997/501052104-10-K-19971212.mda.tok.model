item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this discussion includes certain forward looking statements about the company s business and its expectations 
any such statements are subject to risk that could cause the actual results to vary materially from expectations 
for a further discussion of the various risks that may affect the company s business and expectations  see certain factors that may affect future operating results at the end of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations revenues 
revenues amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
annual revenue growth amounted to in fiscal and  and in fiscal revenue growth during fiscal and was principally driven by customer demand 
the accelerated revenue growth during fiscal was driven by a variety of factors including customer demand and the effect of acquisitions of distribution rights to certain domestic sales territories previously held by certain of the company s independent dealers 
although revenue growth in fiscal was consistent with the revenue growth experienced in fiscal  it was lower than management s expectations 
the shortfall in revenue growth from management s expectations is primarily attributable to the impact of the company s product transition from dos and unix platforms to the windows and client server environments 
the company has  in certain cases  experienced a longer sales cycle than anticipated for client server transactions due to their complexity and size 
in addition  the company has not realized the revenue growth anticipated in the government and education market due to slower than expected penetration of that market 
product revenues amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
product revenues grew by in fiscal and  and in fiscal product revenue growth in fiscal and was principally the result of an increase in sales volume driven by customer demand 
the rate of product revenue growth experienced in fiscal as compared with the accelerated rate of product revenue growth in fiscal is attributable to the factors described above 
service revenues amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
service revenues grew by in fiscal and  and in fiscal service revenues amounted to  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the growth in service revenues in all periods reflects an increase in maintenance revenue from expansion of the installed base and the level of services sold to that installed base  as well as an increase in the level of maintenance contracts and professional services accompanying new sales 
international revenues  which include both revenues from the company s international subsidiaries and sales to independent international dealers  grew in fiscal to million from million in fiscal international revenues in fiscal were million 
international revenues amounted to of total revenues in fiscal as compared to of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the growth in international revenues experienced in fiscal principally reflects the results of the company s fiscal acquisition of distribution rights to certain international sales territories previously held by certain independent dealers of the company 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal and  and in fiscal product gross profit as a percentage of product revenues was in fiscal and  and in fiscal the improvement in product gross profit in fiscal and as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to improved product mix 
in fiscal the company s product revenue was derived from sales of systems in which software  which typically generates higher gross profit  was an increasingly higher proportion of product revenues 
product mix in fiscal was consistent with that experienced in fiscal service gross profit as a percentage of service revenues was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in service gross profit in all periods is primarily attributable to the growth in service revenues without a proportionate increase in service expenses 
this has been accomplished by the implementation of programs which focus on revenue enhancement for services provided  as well as improved efficiency in the delivery of such services 
expenses 
expenses as a percentage of revenues were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in all periods relates to increased business volume 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales were in fiscal and in fiscal and the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal is a result of management s decision to invest in staffing and programs to develop the company s international and corporate marketing operations as well as its government and education division

these expenses are net of capitalized software development costs of million  million and million  respectively 
engineering  research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were in fiscal and  and in fiscal the growth in engineering  research and development expenses resulted primarily from the development of new products in the windows and client server environments 
increased spending on software development costs reflects the company s commitment to further enhance existing products  making them easier to use  and on new product development 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal  and fiscal general and administrative expenses included an immaterial amount of expenses recognized in conjunction with the company s plan to ensure its information systems are year compliant 
other expense  net amounted to less than of revenues in fiscal  and other expense  net is composed primarily of amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions made by the company which is offset by interest income earned on its investments 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate may fluctuate between periods as a result of various factors  none of which is material  either individually or in the aggregate  to the consolidated results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources working capital as of september  amounted to million as compared with million at september  cash and equivalents and marketable securities at those dates amounted to million and million  respectively 
cash provided by operations decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal cash provided by operations amounted to million in fiscal the decrease in operating cash flows in fiscal was principally due to an increase in accounts receivable related to year end sales volume 
the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal as compared to fiscal was principally due to increased earnings and unearned service revenues as well as non cash charges related to depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes  partially offset by investments in the company s internal customer lease program 
cash provided by operations was more than sufficient to fund investments in equipment and capitalized software development costs in fiscal  and investments in equipment in fiscal  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the company anticipates that investment in equipment in fiscal will be comparable to fiscal the company expects to finance these investments from available cash and operating cash flow generated in fiscal certain factors that may affect future operating results except for historical matters  the matters discussed in the annual report and or form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the act 
the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act and is including this statement for the express purpose of availing itself of the protection of the safe harbor with respect to all forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the following important factors  among others  could cause actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report and or form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
potential fluctuations in results 
the company s operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of the introduction of new products and product enhancements by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new products  mix of products sold  the purchasing patterns of its customers  competitive pricing pressure and general economic conditions 
the company historically has realized a relatively larger percentage of its annual revenues and profits in the fourth quarter and a relatively smaller percentage in the first quarter of each fiscal year  although there can be no assurance that this pattern will continue 
in addition  while the company has contracts to supply systems to certain customers over an extended period of time  substantially all of the company s product revenue and profits in each quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
if near term demand for the company s products weakens or if significant anticipated sales in any quarter do not close when expected  the company s revenues for that quarter will be adversely affected 
the company believes that its operating results for any one period are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
product development and technological change 
the markets for time and attendance  labor management  and data collection systems are characterized by continual change and improvement in computer software and hardware technology 
the company s future success will depend largely on its ability to enhance its existing product lines and to develop new products and interfaces to third party products on a timely basis for the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers 
although the company is continually seeking to further enhance its product offerings and to develop new products and interfaces  there can be no assurance that these efforts will succeed  or that  if successful  such product enhancements or new products will achieve widespread market acceptance  or that the company s competitors will not develop and market products which are superior to the company s products or achieve greater market acceptance 
the company is transitioning its product offerings from dos and unix platforms to the windows and client server environments 
the company s revenue growth and results of operations in fiscal will depend in part on the success of this product transition 
competition 
the time and attendance  labor management  and data collection industries are highly competitive 
competition is increasing as competitors in related industries  such as human resources and payroll  enter the market 
advances in software development tools have accelerated the software development process and  therefore  can allow competitors to penetrate certain of the company s markets 
maintaining the company s technological and other advantages over competitors will require continued investment by the company in research and development and marketing and sales programs 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to make such investments or be able to achieve the technological advances necessary to maintain its competitive advantages 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s operating results through price reductions and or loss of market share 
year many currently installed computer systems and software products will not function properly in the year and beyond 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with the century change 
although the company currently offers software products that are designed to work properly in the year and beyond  there can be no assurance that the company s software products contain all necessary date code changes 
the company has warranted  and may in the future warrant  to certain customers that its products will work in the year and beyond 
in addition  the company has initiated a program to identify and correct or reprogram its systems where necessary 
if the company s program is not completed on a timely basis  if the systems of other companies on which the company relies fail  if customer demand is reduced due to customers concerns about year issues  or if the company s own products fail in the year and beyond  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
attracting and retaining sufficient technical personnel for product development  support and sales 
the company has encountered intense competition for experienced technical personnel for product development  technical support and sales and expects such competition to continue in the future 
any inability to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel could adversely affect the company s ability to produce  support and sell robust products in a timely manner 
dependence on alternate distribution channels 
the company markets and sells its products through its direct sales organization  independent dealers and oems 
for the fiscal year ended september   approximately of the company s revenue was generated through sales to dealers and oems 
reduction in the sales efforts of the company s major dealers and or oems  or termination or changes in their relationships with the company  could have a material adverse effect on the results of the company s operations 
dependence on time and attendance product line 
to date  more than of the company s revenues have been attributable to sales of time and attendance systems and services 
competitive pressures or other factors could cause the company s time and attendance products to lose market acceptance or experience significant price erosion  adversely affecting the results of the company s operations 
reliance on key vendors 
the company depends upon the reliability and viability of a variety of software development tools owned by third parties to develop its products 
if these tools are inadequate or not properly supported  the company s ability to release competitive products in a timely manner could be adversely impacted 
also  certain parts and components used in the company s hardware products are purchased from single vendors 
the company has chosen to source these items from single vendors because it believes that the vendor chosen is able to consistently provide the company with the highest quality product at a competitive price on a timely basis 
while the company has to date been able to obtain adequate supplies of these parts and components  the company s inability to transition to alternate sources on a timely basis if and as required in the future could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in addition  the company purchases payroll interface software from a single vendor for resale in certain of its time and attendance systems 
although the company believes its relationship with this vendor is good  any interruption or termination of the company s rights to resell such software could delay shipment of certain of the company s products and require the company to write its own software to perform this function 
although the company believes it would be able to produce its own payroll interface software  any delay or problems encountered in doing so could temporarily and adversely affect the company s results of operations
