forward looking statements from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  technological developments  new products  research and development activities  patent and other litigation and similar matters 
there are a variety of factors that could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations include the following the market for products designed to treat sleep disordered breathing related respiratory conditions is characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology 
the development of new or innovative products by others or the discovery of alternative treatments for such conditions could result in the company s products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market for the company s products is also highly competitive 
the failure of the company to meet the prices offered by its competitors  or offer products which either contain features similar to or more desirable than those products offered by its competitors or which are perceived as reliable by consumers could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
most of the company s competitors have greater financial  research  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  some of the company s competitors sell additional lines of products  and therefore can bundle products to offer higher discounts  or offer rebates or other incentive programs to gain a competitive advantage 
the company s competitors may also employ litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
the company s inability to compete effectively against existing or future competitors would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s operating results have  from time to time  fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations may result from the absence of a backlog of orders for the company s products  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  the geographic mix of product sales  the success of the company s marketing efforts in new regions  changes in third party reimbursement  timing of regulatory action  timing of order by distributors  expenditures incurred for research and development  competitive pricing in different regions  seasonality  the cost and effect of promotional and marketing programs and the effect of foreign currency transaction gains or losses  among other factors  in addition  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws in the various countries in which the company conducts its operations 
the company s success is dependent upon the ability of the company s customers to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors for purchasing the company s products 
third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the prescribed device has not received appropriate united states food and drug administration fda or other governmental regulatory clearances  is not used in accordance with cost effective treatment methods as determined by the payor  or is experimental  unnecessary or inappropriate 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
the cost containment measures that health care providers are instituting could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to sell its products and may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in some markets  such as spain  france and germany  government reimbursement is currently available for purchase of rental of the company s products  subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations 
in other markets  such as australia  the united kingdom and japan  there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleep disordered breathing related respiratory conditions 
a substantial portion of the company s net revenue is generated from sales outside north america 
the company expects that such sales will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s net revenues in the future 
the company s sales outside of north america are subject to certain inherent risks of global operations  including fluctuations in currency exchange rate  tariffs  import licenses  trade policies  domestic and foreign tax policies and foreign medical device manufacturing regulations 
the company has had foreign currency transaction gains and losses in recent periods 
a significant fall in the value of the united states dollar against certain international currencies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
other factors which could potentially have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial conditions include the costs and other effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings  settlements and investigations  claims and changes in those items  and developments or assertions by or against the company relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses
