item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
fiscal years   and compared general fiscal has been a year of action as the company has taken the initial steps to correct disappointing operating results 
in fiscal  the company had a net loss of million on net sales of million compared to net income of million in fiscal and net loss of million in fiscal on net sales of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
of the million fiscal loss  million was from restructuring charges and million was from special cost of goods sold charges 
the elements and impact of these charges are discussed under the headings gross profit and special charges and restructuring charges below 
the company dramatically reduced its debt in fiscal from  to  this was accomplished principally by a sale leaseback transaction which was completed in february the company s mobile  alabama facilities were sold for net proceeds of approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at the end of fiscal  the company had cash and cash equivalents in excess of outstanding debt 
the company currently has a million four year credit facility that expires in november availability at any given point in time is a function of eligible accounts receivable and inventory levels 
at october   total availability was million 
the company introduced significant new products during fiscal  including the qms hammerhead  a page per minute ppm monochrome printer with graphic arts capabilities  and the qms  a ppm monochrome printer with size capabilities to by 
in october  the company introduced the new qms magicolor  a color print system which delivers up to ppm in color and ppm monochrome 
these new products have energized our sales and marketing management team for fiscal and should increase the company s ability to compete effectively in domestic and international markets 
in addition  the company announced in october a return to the original equipment manufacturer oem market with a contract to provide private label print systems and accessories 
the oem market provides an additional channel for product sales without conflicting with our existing sales channels 
the company enters fiscal with a renewed focus on its core business of laser print systems  consumables and service 
with a lowered cost structure  adequate borrowing capacity  new product introductions and a new oem market  management believes the company is positioned for renewed profitability and improved stockholder value 
net sales table of net sales comparisons for key channels year to year net sales increases decreases in thousands us us     us us     us us      europe australia      japan      qms canada      qms circuits     all other     total      total sales declined by million  or  during fiscal compared to a decline of million  or  during fiscal the decline in fiscal year is primarily due to reduced commissions from our european and japanese partners totaling million 
the decline in european and japanese commissions is primarily due to fiscal end of life sales of ppm products 
this resulted in higher fiscal sales without a corresponding increase in sales of the replacement product 
an additional reduction of million occurred in the reseller channel 
reseller sales declined due to a temporary company focus on the graphic arts market and away from traditional reseller markets 
the company has now refocused on traditional as well as niche distributors and has seen an increase in quarterly reseller revenue for the past two quarters following declines in the previous six quarters 
the primary reason for the significant decline in total sales in fiscal is that fiscal sales of million are attributable to japanese  european and australian subsidiaries that the company divested at the start of fiscal although the divested subsidiary operations are no longer reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the company  qms recognizes substantial benefits from the ongoing relationships with the new owners of these operations 
agreements are in place whereby the company sells printer controllers and components at cost to these international distributors and then receives a commission from their sales of qms products 
as a result  the company realizes an income stream from these international operations without the burden of carrying their fixed costs 
the us direct sales channel sells the higher end of the company s product offerings and consumables to major corporate accounts 
generally  product gross margins and the cost of distribution are higher in this channel than in the reseller channel 
during fiscal  the us direct sales operations resulted in a net sales decrease of  which compares to a net sales decrease of during fiscal during fiscal  million  or  of net sales in this channel was attributable to sales of color thermal transfer consumables  which was a product line sold in fiscal and whose sales are therefore no longer available to the company 
excluding this effect  the net sales decline during fiscal would have been 
turnover in sales and marketing personnel during fiscal and contributed to the sales declines in both years 
the company has addressed this issue with the addition of new sales and marketing employees who joined the company during fiscal the us service channel supports the sale of qms products through a nationwide field service organization 
service contracts are available for all company product offerings but are generally written for the higher end products sold through the us direct sales channel 
in addition to qms products  the service organization services products sold by other manufacturers 
the us service business realized a net sales gain of in fiscal compared to a gain of in fiscal this deceleration in service business growth is directly related to the sales decline in the us direct sales channel 
the us reseller channel is responsible for attracting and qualifying resellers of the lower end of the company s product line 
generally  gross margins and distribution costs are lower in this sales channel than in the direct sales channel 
the us reseller channel net sales decreased in fiscal after increasing between fiscal and fiscal reseller sales declined due to a company focus on the graphic arts market and away from traditional reseller markets 
the company has now refocused on traditional as well as niche distributors and has seen an increase in quarterly reseller revenue for the past two quarters following declines in the previous six quarters 
qms europe bv and qms australia pty 
ltd 
were sold to jalak investment bv  effective the beginning of fiscal the company continues to sell controller boards and components to these businesses at cost and then realizes a commission on their sales of qms products to third parties 
as a result of this change in business operations  net sales through these channels are significantly lower in fiscal  with sales to the new qms europe bv of million compared to sales of million by the wholly owned subsidiaries qms europe bv and qms australia pty 
ltd 
in fiscal while the net third party sales of qms europe bv and qms australia pty 
ltd 
are no longer included in the consolidated fiscal and financial statements  the entire operating expense structure of these businesses was also eliminated 
in fiscal  sales to qms europe bv of million are down from fiscal sales of million 
this decrease in revenue was caused primarily by the fiscal end of life sales of the ppm product 
the assets of qms japan kk were divested at the beginning of fiscal the company continues to sell controller boards and components to the new owner of the business at cost and then realizes a commission on their sales of qms products to third parties 
for the same reasons described above for qms europe australia  there are significantly lower net sales through this channel in fiscal  with sales to the new qms japan kk of million compared to sales of million by the wholly owned subsidiary qms japan in fiscal in fiscal  sales to qms japan kk of million are down from fiscal sales of million 
this decrease in revenue was caused primarily by the fiscal end of life sales of the ppm product 
qms canada  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  sells the entire line of company products  services and accessories to end users and through resellers 
net sales for qms canada declined by in fiscal and by in fiscal reasons for the sales decline in fiscal are the same as noted for the us direct and reseller channels discussed above 
in fiscal  the company decreased canadian operations and closed one office 
qms circuits  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary based in fort walton beach  florida  manufactures and markets printed circuit boards for the company and for third party sales 
during fiscal   and  the company also sold controller boards  controller level products to original equipment manufacturers  and printer products 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  qci ceased operations due to continuing losses and the company recorded an  charge for associated closing costs 
gross profit and special charges gross profit dollars decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal a decrease of due primarily to a reduction in revenue  reduced margins on end of life products and special charges totaling million 
excluding special charges  the gross margin on sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease is caused by shorter life spans on products  higher expenses to develop new products being amortized over shorter product life spans and increased competition causing lower margins on print system products 
special cost of goods sold charges for fiscal included fourth quarter excess and obsolete and valuation charges of million related to reduced values for surplus inventory and repaired parts 
additionally  a million fourth quarter charge was taken to reduce the balance of capitalized software development costs to estimated net realizable value 
in fiscal  gross profit decreased as the revenue decreases from the sale of qms japan and qms europe were offset by commission revenues 
operating expenses the company s strategy for fiscal and was to reduce overall costs and bring them in line with revenues 
this was attempted through several avenues including divestitures  reductions in work force  restructuring employee benefit programs  executive salary reductions  and aggressive cost management  although the benefits in fiscal are masked by restructuring charges and increased rental costs 
total operating expenses for fiscal increased to million compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
excluding restructuring expenses  operating expenses were million  million and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the million increase in operating expenses is due to increased rent expense caused by the february sale leaseback of the company s headquarters in mobile  alabama 
the sale leaseback resulted in million increased operating expenses from rent with a corresponding decrease in interest and depreciation expense 
most of the benefit of the reductions in work force that occurred primarily in august of will not be felt until fiscal due to the september fiscal year end 
the combined reduction in salaries from reductions in work force and divestiture of businesses totals million per year 
in fiscal  operating expenses declined by million  or  these improvements are a direct result of eliminating the operating expense structure of the divested japanese  european and australian business operations 
restructuring charges restructuring charges in fiscal totaled million from reductions in force and divestiture of businesses

severance and outplacement expense recorded in fiscal totaled million 
the company entered into agreements during fiscal specifying the retirement of two executives  the president and chief executive officer  and the executive vice president and chief technical officer 
these agreements caused an additional million in fiscal charges related to accelerated retirement benefits and other management transition expenses 
moreover  the company recognized in the income statement cumulative foreign currency translation losses of million in connection with its canadian operations 
these translation losses had previously been recognized as a reduction of stockholders equity 
other income expense interest expense decreased million   from million to million in fiscal after decreasing million   from million to million in fiscal the reduction in fiscal and is directly related to the overall reduction in short term and long term debt due to the divestiture of businesses and sale leaseback of the mobile headquarters and manufacturing property 
interest income increased in fiscal and is attributable to interest earned on the notes receivable from qms europe bv and qms japan kk 
in fiscal  a net gain of million was recognized from the divestiture of businesses  principally the result of the sale of a portion of the color thermal transfer consumables business 
miscellaneous income expense includes gains and losses on asset disposals and foreign currency transactions 
the company did not enter into any material foreign exchange contracts during fiscal   or and has no foreign exchange contracts at october  income taxes no benefit or provision for income taxes was recognized for fiscal or for fiscal  a benefit of of pretax income was recognized 
this benefit resulted from the carryback of losses in japan relating to the divestiture of business operations in that country

factors which may affect future results the company s products include components primarily microprocessors and dynamic random access memory devices which  from time to time  are sensitive to market conditions that may result in limited availability and or price fluctuations 
an interruption in the supply of or significant changes in price for these components could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company purchases print engine mechanisms and consumables from japanese suppliers 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will affect the prices of these products 
the company attempts to mitigate possible negative impacts through yen sharing arrangements with suppliers  foreign exchange contracts  and price negotiations  however  material price increases resulting from exchange rate fluctuations could develop which would adversely affect operating results 
because the company competes in an industry of rapid technological advancement  it is important that the company be able to develop innovative new technologies and leading edge print systems in a timely  cost effective manner 
the company has invested significantly in crown advanced document processing technology which  in addition to providing significantly improved functionality  is intended to reduce the time it takes to develop products 
new product introduction delays could  however  have an adverse impact on operating results 
these factors  including increasingly competitive pressures in the company s markets  along with others that may affect operating results  mean that past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
in addition  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which can result in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at october   compared to million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
cash flow from operations was million for fiscal compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively

the company s working capital was million at october   down from million at the end of fiscal although working capital was reduced  the working capital ratio increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of changes in working capital are primarily the result of a decrease in net receivables million caused by lower sales and improved collections  a decrease in inventory million caused by improved inventory management and a decrease in short term debt million caused primarily by proceeds from the sale leaseback of the mobile headquarters and manufacturing location 
at october   the company was not in compliance with certain covenants contained in the sale leaseback agreement 
on december   the company obtained a one year waiver of non compliance from the lessor through october   in exchange for million in prepaid rent and an amendment to a related warrant agreement 
at the end of the waiver period  the company may be out of compliance with one or more covenants contained in the lease agreement 
among the remedies available to the landlord are the acceleration of all rent for the initial lease term  cancellation of the lease  or all other remedies available at law 
management believes over the next year through further negotiations a further extension of the waiver or a permanent revision of the covenant will be obtained 
management believes that the company s fiscal working capital and capital expenditure needs  as well as funding for research and development  will be met by cash flow from operations and by the foothill credit facility 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
year compliance the company has developed and begun implementing plans to review its purchased and developed software for year compliance 
systems that require modification or replacement have been identified and a plan for resolving year issues has been established 
inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on the company s operations in the past three years 
a significant increase in inflation would adversely affect the company s operations 
recently issued accounting standards management does not believe the adoption of any of the recently issued accounting standards described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements will have a significant impact on the company s financial statements
