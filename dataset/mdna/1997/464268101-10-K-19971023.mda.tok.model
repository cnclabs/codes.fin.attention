this is a regulation driven market which is strongly influenced by both the perceived attitude and actions of the various governmental agencies in the promulgation and the enforcement of environmental regulations 
the effects of the regulatory climate on the market are outside the company s ability to control and  for any given period  may be either a positive or negative factor on the company s performance 
as in many industries  consolidation of companies within the company s market is an on going trend 
as a result  the company is dealing with the effects of larger and well financed competitors who also have the organizational resources to compete aggressively in the global market place 
inflation the effect of inflation on the costs of the company and its ability to pass on cost increases in the form of increased selling prices is dependent upon market conditions and its competitive environment 
inflation in the domestic economy has been relatively low for the past three years and has not had a significant impact on the company
