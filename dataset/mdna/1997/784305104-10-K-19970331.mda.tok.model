liquidity and capital resources capital requirements san jose water company s budgeted capital expenditures for compared to  exclusive of capital expenditures financed by customer contributions and advances  are as follows budgeted capital expenditures in thousands source of supply reservoirs and tanks pump stations and equipment   distribution system   equipment and other   the capital budget is concentrated in two areas  in main replacements and related services to systematically renew the company s aging infrastructure  and  to implement the third phase of a geographical information and mapping system and a new accounting system 
san jose water company expects to incur approximately  exclusive of customer contributions and advances  in capital expenditures over the next five years 
san jose water company s actual capital expenditures may vary from its projection due to changes in the expected demand for services  weather patterns  actions by governmental agencies and general economic conditions 
total additions to utility plant normally exceed company financed additions by several million dollars because certain new facilities are constructed using advances from developers and contributions in aid of construction 
most of san jose water company s distribution system has been constructed over the last forty years 
expenditure levels for renewal and modernization of this part of the system will grow at an increasing rate as these components reach the end of their useful lives 
additionally  in most cases replacement cost will significantly exceed the cost of the retired asset due to increases in the cost of goods and services 
sources of capital san jose water company s ability to finance future construction programs and sustain dividend payments depends on its ability to attract external financing and maintain or increase internally generated funds 
the level of future earnings and the related cash flow from operations is dependent  in large part  upon the timing and outcome of regulatory proceedings 
over the past five years sjw corp 
has paid its shareholders  in the form of dividends  an average of of its net income 
the remaining earnings have been reinvested 
capital requirements not funded by earnings are expected to be funded through external financing in the form of unsecured senior notes or a commercial bank line of credit

in  san jose water company redeemed its  series m first mortgage bonds at maturity 
san jose water company intends to retire all remaining first mortgage bonds by and satisfy all forseeable future long term financing needs with senior notes 
factors that may affect future results the results of operations of san jose water company generally depend on the following factors regulation  surface water supply  and operation and maintenance expense 
regulation principally all the operating revenue of san jose water company results from the sale of water at rates authorized by the commission 
the commission sets rates that are intended to provide revenue sufficient to recover operating expenses and produce a reasonable return on common equity 
as a result of the commission s general rate case decision  san jose water company was authorized new rates  which became effective on july  in the decision the commission authorized an average annual rate increase of through  for a total rate increase of million during this period 
the new rates reflect an authorized return on equity of  which is within the range of recent rates of return authorized by the commission for water utilities 
additionally  san jose water company was authorized to recover the million balance in its voluntary conservation memorandum account via a oneyear surcharge effective concurrently with the general rate increase 
the general rate case decision granted san jose water company memorandum account protection for the largely indeterminate costs associated with the new or more stringent federal water quality regulations 
with the establishment of the water quality memorandum account  any potential financial exposure resulting from these regulations has been substantially reduced 
the decision also authorized the  balance in the tax memorandum account to be transferred to the balancing account for future collection in rates 
in november  san jose water company filed an advice letter requesting a step rate increase in the amount of  to be effective january  surface water supply the level of surface water available in each year depends on the amount of rainfall and run off collected in san jose water company s santa cruz mountain reservoirs 
in a normal year  surface supply provides of the total water supply of the system 
surface water is a less costly source of water and its availability may significantly impact the results of operations 
operation and maintenance expense san jose water company reached an agreement with its unionized personnel covering and the agreement includes a wage increase each year and minor benefit modifications 
environmental matters san jose water company s operations are subject to water quality and pollution control regulations issued by the united states environmental protection agency epa  the california department of health services and the california regional water quality control board 
the company is also subject to environmental laws and regulations administered by other state and local regulatory agencies 
under the federal safe drinking water act sdwa  san jose water company is subject to regulation by the epa of the quality of water it sells and treatment techniques it uses to make the water potable 
the epa promulgates nationally applicable maximum contaminant levels mcls for contaminants found in drinking water 
san jose water company is currently in compliance with all of the mcls promulgated to date 
the epa has continuing authority  however  to issue additional regulations under the sdwa 
san jose water company has implemented monitoring activities and installed specific water treatment improvements enabling it to comply with all existing mcls and plan for compliance with future drinking water regulations 
to comply with the state total coliform regulation  disinfection of san jose water company wells is being phased in over the next two to three years 
to date  ten of the company s nineteen key groundwater production stations have been equipped with hypochlorinators  with six more installations to be completed in the epa is expected to mandate disinfection of all groundwater supplies by in  state assembly bill no 
was signed into law requiring public water systems in california serving at least  connections to fluoridate water 
the law provides that water systems would not be required to comply unless funding for the needed capital and associated costs are available from any source other than ratepayers  shareholders  local taxpayers or bondholders of the public water system 
in addition to sdwa  other environmental regulations are becoming increasingly important 
the santa clara county toxic gas ordinance became effective in requiring the elimination of chlorine gas disinfection systems or the installation of complete containment systems to control accidental chlorine gas discharges 
during  san jose water company replaced the chlorine gas disinfection systems at its two water treatment plants with hypochlorinators which accomplish disinfection with liquid sodium hypochlorite 
these facilities are currently operational and in compliance with all state and local hazardous materials storage regulations 
other state and local environmental regulations apply to san jose water company s operations and facilities 
these regulations relate primarily to the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
san jose water company is currently in compliance with state and local regulations governing underground storage tanks  disposal of hazardous wastes  non point source discharges  and the warning provisions of the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of future drinking water regulations will most likely require increased monitoring  and may mandate disinfection or other treatment of underground water supplies  more stringent performance standards for treatment plants and procedures to reduce levels of disinfection by products 
san jose water company continues to seek to establish mechanisms for recovery of government mandated environmental compliance costs 
however  there are limited regulatory mechanisms and procedures available to the company for the recovery of such costs and there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered 
of all of the regulations being considered under the current sdwa  the proposed disinfectants disinfection by products rule is anticipated to have the most significant impact on water utilities 
due to be promulgated in the year  this rule would impose more stringent monitoring requirements and drinking water standards for by products formed during the disinfection of water 
the santa clara valley water district  whose imported surface water represents approximately of san jose water company s supply  projects that compliance with this regulation could  by the year  cost over  in capital improvements and an additional  per year in operating expenses 
if incurred  part of these costs would be passed along to san jose water company and other water retailers in the form of higher rates for purchased water and pump taxes 
san jose water company would seek a rate increase  via an advice letter filing  to recover the additional costs 
the company s surface and groundwater sources are generally of a higher quality than the imported water supplies  and are not expected to require extensive modifications of existing treatment processes 
nonregulated subsidiaries the investment in california water service company is expected to produce pre tax dividend income and cash flow of approximately  sjw land company s parking revenue is largely dependent upon the level of events and activities at the san jose arena which is located adjacent to its parking facility
