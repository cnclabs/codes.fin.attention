in arriving at the charges related to the restructuring plan  management was required to make certain estimates  including but not limited to estimates about expected proceeds from inventory sales in closed units  real estate valuations  timing of closed store dispositions  and an assumption that fry s electronics  inc and its affiliates would complete the purchase of six incredible universe r stores pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements

net sales and operating revenues year ended december  in millions radioshack    incredible universe computer city    tandy name brand closed other sales consolidated net sales and operating revenues increased to billion in from billion in the increase is primarily attributable to two factors the addition of radioshack stores net of closures and computer city r stores during and the incremental addition of a full year s revenue related to stores opened during whose total revenue reflected a partial year 
tandy announced a store closure plan in december and accordingly  consolidated revenues are not expected to match levels obtained in excluding the announced store closures  consolidated sales for would have approximated billion 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
for the year ended december   the company showed a comparable store sales decline  which was the result of all divisions experiencing comparable sales declines during the year 
although the radioshack division same store sales declined less than  incredible universe was down and computer city was down 
these declines are indicative of the heightened level of competition within the industry and lower consumer demand which negatively impacted the consumer electronics industry as a whole 
this lower demand was primarily attributed to higher consumer debt levels and the lack of new products with significant technological advances 
radioshack sales for increased less than to billion from billion 
the mcduff store closures  which are included in radioshack sales  totaled million in excluding mcduff  radioshack sales increased 
consumer electronics  while remaining the single largest product category of radioshack s sales mix  declined slightly to of sales from in and in principally due to declines in audio and video and personal electronic sales including portable radio and cassette product  vcrs  and camcorders

although computer sales have increased as a percentage of total sales  system units sold have declined 
repair income and cellular commissions experienced a slight decline in to of sales from in  which was up from in the decline in cellular commissions is partially attributable to the changes in the california market  which experienced increased consumer demand in due to enactment of certain laws at that time

these increases are the result of the chain s growth from stores as of january  to a total of stores as of december  although the company announced the closing of computer city stores in december  revenues in this division are not expected to change significantly  due in part to stores opened in that were only opened a partial year  incremental revenue from the anticipated addition of approximately five new stores as well as computer city s increased focus on a more experienced target customer group 
the closing computer city stores generated revenues of million in see discussion under provision for business restructuring for certain actions management is taking to improve sales and operating results for this division 
incredible universe sales increased to million from million in revenues for increased over revenues of million 
these increases are the result of the chain s growth from three stores as of january  to a total of stores as of december  revenues for will be materially reduced from levels due to the closure of this division in revenues will be eliminated entirely after see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   the company s consolidated sales and operating revenues increased to billion from billion in the increase in sales is primarily attributable to the addition of radioshack stores net of closures  eight incredible universe stores and computer city stores during due to the closure of tandy name brand retail group tandy name brand stores during the first quarter of  sales for that division decreased from million in to million in this division is now closed and sales of the remaining tandy name brand stores are included in the radioshack total for each period presented in the net sales and operating revenues table

the expenses of the credit operations have significantly declined as a result of the sale of the private label credit card portfolios which was completed by march  the sale of the credit card portfolio balance in has significantly reduced the bad debt provision during as compared to prior years 
in addition  servicing costs associated with the portfolio have also been eliminated with the sale 
these factors were the primary contributors to the decrease in the expenses of the credit operations from to offsetting these reductions is decreased interest income see discussion below resulting from the credit card portfolio sale 
commencing in  the company receives fees from an unrelated third party financier of its private label credit card portfolio balance for the generation of normal interest bearing accounts  and pays a fee for the generation of special purpose promotional accounts  such as zero interest for twelve months

interest income relating to the intertan  inc intertan notes will continue in but at a reduced level as principal payments are received 
in addition  the ast research  inc ast note was repaid in and  accordingly  the company will no longer receive interest income from this source 
other interest income relates primarily to cash equivalents of the company and was higher in than in and due to increased cash equivalents resulting from proceeds received from the divestiture of discontinued manufacturing and marketing operations 
the company has entered into contracts with fry s electronics  inc of palo alto  california for the sale of the assets of six incredible universe stores and contracts with certain affiliates for the sale of the real estate of those stores 
upon successful completion of the anticipated closings  the company will hold multiple notes receivable approximating million with varying maturities ranging from one to five years and varying interest rates ranging from to 
interest income of approximately million relating to these notes is anticipated to be recognized in  contingent upon the transactions closing 
based on the above  interest income is expected to decline slightly in interest expense has grown since as a result of the company s increased usage of short term borrowing facilities including seasonal bank credit lines and commercial paper facilities  as excess funds from the manufacturing and marketing operations divestiture and sale of credit operations have been fully utilized 
the use of these facilities was significantly higher during the years ended december   and  as the company retired long term debt  funded store expansion and executed a share repurchase program
