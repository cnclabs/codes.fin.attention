item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
all data in the tables are in thousands  except for percentages and per share data 
the company is an integrated systems solution provider of cleanrooms and cleanroom component systems for the semiconductor industry 
in recent years  the company has typically had one to five significant customers  each of which accounted for more than of the company s annual revenues  these customers do not necessarily remain significant in subsequent years 
the semiconductor industry has been historically cyclical in nature 
during  the semiconductor industry experienced a cyclical downturn that has resulted in reduced capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers and the reduction or delay of new cleanroom facilities 
industry analysts attribute the current downturn to overcapacity in the dram market  created by extensive capital spending from through the first quarter of analysts believe the downturn is expected to be shorter than past downturns because of the continued robust forecast for personal computers through the end of the decade 
management believes that the current downturn has resulted in lower capital spending by the semiconductor manufacturers over the third and fourth quarters of and will continue through the first and second quarters of the length and severity of the economic downturn is still subject to significant uncertainty 
the downturn in the semiconductor industry did not significantly affect the company s operating results in because of the size of the company s backlog at the end of and the company s ability to secure several large contracts during the first and second quarters of the downturn  however  resulted in fewer contracts available to bid  a significant increase in price competition on contracts  and reduced margins on such contracts 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company experienced a reduction in new contract awards which has resulted in a decrease in the company s backlog from million at december  to million at december  the company also experienced one contract reduction during the first quarter of and one contract reduction during the third quarter of these contract changes did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition for the year ended december  although the company has experienced an increase in contract bidding activity during the first quarter of  management anticipates that the above described events will adversely affect its revenues and profitability in the first quarter of if the industry downturn continues longer than current expectations  the company experiences contract reductions or delays  or the company is not successful in securing contracts at reasonable gross margins that it is currently bidding on  the above described events could have a significant impact on the company s operations throughout the remainder of although there is uncertainty surrounding the length and severity of this current downturn in the semiconductor industry  management believes that changes taking place in the industry should result in expanded capital expenditures in the long term 
in response to the current downturn  management has taken steps to reduce the company s cost structure including a reduction in the company s work force of approximately five percent 
this reduction in force was implemented in late september during the remainder of the downturn  management will monitor the company s cost structure and take appropriate actions as considered necessary  but continue to develop state of the art cleanroom technology and provide world class support to the company s customers 
the company s contract revenue and operating results fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter depending on such factors as the timing of significant customer orders  the timing of revenue and cost recognition  variations in contract mix  changes in customer buying patterns  fluctuations in the semiconductor equipment market  utilization of capacity  manufacturing productivity and efficiency  availability of key components and trends in the economies of the geographical regions in which the company operates 
the company uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for its long term contracts 
the company recognizes revenue in proportion to the costs incurred to date in relation to the total anticipated costs 
revenue recognized may not be the same as progress billings to the customer 
underbillings are reflected in an asset account costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on contracts in progress  and overbillings are reflected in a liability account billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on contracts in progress 
the company generates revenue in three geographic regions  north america  asia pacific rim and europe 
contracts in the asia pacific rim region are generally denominated in united states dollars 
although risk of fluctuations in currency value does not affect such dollar denominated contracts  changes in the relative value of the dollar could make the company less competitive in this region 
contracts to be performed in europe may be denominated in local currency  and the company bears the risk of changes in the relative value of the dollar and the local currencies 
the company has in the past and may in the future attempt to hedge against currency fluctuations on contracts denominated in local currencies 
there can be no assurance  however  that such hedging will fully insulate the company from fluctuations or will not expose the company to additional risks of loss 
the company s business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information is presented 
results of operations contract revenue change change contract revenue    contract revenue for increased by to million from million in the increase is attributable to a large backlog at the beginning of that resulted in strong contract activity in the first half of and numerous large contracts that the company was awarded during the first and second quarters of that resulted in additional revenue as the contracts progressed during the third and fourth quarters of the decrease in the company s backlog from december  to december  is attributed to fewer contracts available to bid 
see discussions of industry downturn above 
during  contract revenue increased by to million from million in this increase is attributed to an increase in the number of contracts that were awarded to the company during  an increase in the average size of the contracts awarded and an increase in the manufacturing capacity of the company s facilities  resulting in higher production of cleanroom component parts during compared to north america contract revenue for increased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue north america increased to in compared to in the increase is the result of numerous contracts received in north america 
these contracts were larger than the company has received historically and were completed on schedules that were much faster than the company has historically been required to perform 
contract revenue for was relatively even at million  or of total contract revenue  as compared to million  or of total contract revenue  for this was the result of a greater emphasis on new cleanroom construction outside the united states by the company and the semiconductor industry as a whole 
asia pacific rim contract revenue for decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue asia pacific decreased to in compared to in two factors contributed to the decrease in asia pacific revenue 
first  during the company recognized revenue for two significantly large contracts in taiwan 
these contracts were substantially completed during second  the semiconductor industry downturn impacted taiwan and other asian countries to the extent that the company did not have the same opportunity to bid on contracts in that it had during during  the company increased its sales focus in this region  including the opening of a design  engineering  contract administration and sales office in hsin chu  taiwan 
as a result  contract revenue increased to million  or of total contract revenue  in from million  or of total contract revenue  in although revenues decreased from  management believes that the asia pacific rim area will be its fastest growing region over the long term 
a significant portion of contracts awarded in this region are cleanroom system solution contracts which include two or more cleanroom components 
europe contract revenue for increased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue europe increased to in compared to in the increase is attributed to two contracts of significant size received in early and substantially completed by the end of the year 
contract revenue in europe increased to million  or of total contract revenue  in from million  or of total contract revenue  in this increase is the result of an increased sales effort by the company to establish the company as a significant cleanroom system solutions provider in the european region 
management believes that revenues attributed to european contracts will continue to grow in the future 
gross profit change change gross profit thousands    percentage of contract revenue gross profit for the year ended december  increased by to million from million for the year ended december  gross profit increased as a percentage of revenue to for compared to for the increases are the result of continual improvement in the company s manufacturing facility creating greater efficiencies and less costs to produce product  and better project management resulting in less problems at the construction sites which allows the company to install its product with less time and labor expense 
contracts received during also were generally bid at higher margins than those received during also affecting the increase from to were significant events during that contributed to the company realizing smaller margins during these events included the company s continued expansion of manufacturing facilities and a product failure during the second quarter of the expansion created manufacturing inefficiencies  project delays and overruns resulting in higher than expected cost of contracts during the product failure was the result of defective motors purchased from a third party vendor and resulted in a one time charge to costs of contracts of approximately million 
management believes that as a result of competitive pricing pressure currently taking place as part of the contract bidding process see discussion of industry downturn above  during margins will be less than what the company experienced during gross profit for decreased by to million from million in and decreased as a percentage of contract revenue to in from in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of manufacturing inefficiencies and a product failure at a single project location that are discussed above 
also affecting the decrease from to are certain strategic projects awarded at margins less than the average 
selling  general and administrative expenses change change selling  general and administrative expenses thousands    percentage of contract revenue selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million  or of contract revenue  from million  or of contract revenue  in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is the result of increased sales activity worldwide and a full year of costs associated with the company s asia pacific office 
the asia pacific office was only operational for six months during sales  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales has remained relatively constant from to selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million  or of contract revenue  from million  or of contract revenue  in this increase is related to greater selling and marketing activities required to improve the number and size of contracts awarded during as compared to the company also increased it s general and administrative headcount to meet the requirements of the increased sales volume in research and development change change research and development expense thousands percentage of contract revenue research and development expense remained relatively constant from to management believes that the company will increase its research and development expenses during  both in actual dollars spent and as a percentage of revenue in order to develop innovative products  to be on the cutting edge of the millimeter manufacturing facility technology and to modify existing products to be less expensive to produce and easier to install 
research and development expense increased slightly from to this increase was the result of research and development projects that were based on specific customers and contracts 
depreciation and amortization change change depreciation and amortization expense thousands percentage of contract revenue depreciation and amortization expense during increased by to  or of contract revenue  from  or of contract revenue  in this increase is the result of depreciation on furniture  fixtures  computer equipment and software required for increased sales  marketing and administration activities 
depreciation and amortization expense in increased by to  or of contract revenue  from  or of contract revenue  in this increase is the result of the purchase of furniture  fixtures  computer equipment and software required for the increased headcount in sales  marketing and administration including the start up of the asia pacific office 
other income expense  net change change other income expense thousands percentage of contract revenue other income expense increased in to  from  in the increase is generally the result of the net effect of an increase in interest expense and a settlement on litigation with a third party vendor for defective motors see discussion in gross profit above 
other income expense decreased in to  from  in during  the company earned interest on cash and investments from proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
as revenues have increased  the company has funded the increase in non cash current assets by using cash on hand and lines of credit as needed  resulting in an increase in interest expense and a decrease in interest income in income taxes change change income taxes thousands   percentage of contract revenue the effective tax rate for was approximately compared to for the decrease is primarily the result of a large exemption during from our foreign sales corporation 
the effective tax rate for was 
the change in income tax expense from year to year is directly related to the change in earnings before income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  this includes cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and respectively 
receivables  including retentions  see note d of notes to financial statements increased to million at december  compared to million at december  this increase was the result of increased billing volume throughout days sales outstanding the ratio between receivables  excluding retention  and average daily revenue taken over the year increased to days at december   from days at december  the company s operations used million of cash in operations during  compared to providing million of cash in during  the company experienced an increase in receivables as a result of growth in revenues and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately million 
at december   the company had lines of credit totaling million  of which million was available at year end 
amounts drawn under the lines bear interest at a commercial loan variable rate index at december  and are due no later than june   with options to renew the agreement on an annual basis 
the lines are secured by all accounts receivable and inventory 
during  the company used million for the purchase of property and equipment 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures in for routine additions and replacements of property  plant  and equipment will be approximately million 
these purchases will be financed through long term debt or capital leases 
management believes that existing cash balances  borrowings available under the lines of credit  and cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet the company s anticipated cash requirements through december  however  in the event the company experiences adverse operating performance or above anticipated capital expenditure requirements  additional financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  would be available on favorable terms if at all 
impact of future accounting pronouncements none 
factors affecting future results the company s future operations will be impacted by  among other factors  the length and severity of the current economic downturn in the semiconductor industry as more fully discussed above 
the length and severity of the current economic downturn in the semiconductor industry remains subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
the company s operations are also subject to additional risks and uncertainties that could result in actual operating results differing materially from anticipated operating results and past operating results and trends 
these risks and uncertainties include pricing pressures  cancellations of existing contracts  timing of significant customer orders  increased competition  and changes in semiconductor and cleanroom technology
