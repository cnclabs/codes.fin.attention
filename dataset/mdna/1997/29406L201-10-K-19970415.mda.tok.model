sunnyside project sunnyside is an approximately mw net waste coal fired facility at a site located adjacent to the sunnyside coal mine in carbon county  utah which was constructed by parsons main  inc  pmi 
the facility reached commercial operation on november  the sunnyside project is owned by sunnyside cogeneration associates sca  a joint venture in which the company owned varying majority interests from to approximately until september  and thereafter an approximate interest until december  at which time the company sold its remaining interest in sca 
in connection with the sale  the company received consideration of million in cash on january  and promissory notes aggregating million  bearing interest at per annum 
interest is payable to the company quarterly and principal of  was received by the company on september   principal of  was due on december  and the remaining principal of  is due on december  however  as more fully described under item legal proceedings  the purchasers of the company s interest in sca have entered into a legal proceeding with the company 
pending the resolution of the legal proceeding  the purchasers have withheld their scheduled payments of principal and interest due on the promissory notes since june as of december   the purchasers have principal and interest payments in arrears of  and  respectively 
in addition  the company recorded in a receivable related to a purchase price adjustment  as provided for in the purchase and sale agreement  of approximately million  of which  was received in april the balance of purchase price adjustment is also being disputed in the legal proceeding with the purchasers 
the company also retained certain inchoate rights  including potential refundable sales taxes and certain legal settlements  arising out of activities prior to the date of the sale 
the retained rights were fully satisfied after the company received sales tax refunds aggregating million and  in and  respectively  and received  to settle a legal proceeding in see notes a  b  g  h and n to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
milesburg project on april   the company purchased  for an aggregate purchase price of  all of the outstanding capital stock of milesburg energy  inc mei  the company which controlled the development rights to an existing mw net oil fired electric generating facility  which was retired from service in in connection with the stock purchase  the company paid  in cash and issued promissory notes totaling  and a subsidiary of the company assumed pre acquisition mei liabilities totaling  the notes payable  pre acquisition liabilities and other liabilities incurred subsequent to the purchase become payable only under certain conditions  the most significant of which relates to the closing of construction financing and commencement of construction for the milesburg project 
if this project is developed  the company would replace this facility with a waste coal fired electric generating facility 
in  mei executed a year power purchase agreement with west penn power company wppc for the sale of all of the facility s electrical output with a fixed capacity rate component and an additional fluctuating rate component which is derived from wppc s avoided energy cost 
the power purchase agreement was approved by the public utilities commission of the state of pennsylvania puc  and was subsequently appealed to the commonwealth court of pennsylvania by certain industrial intervenors 
during the lengthy appeals process  which extended beyond certain contract milestone dates in the power purchase agreement  wppc requested that its original petition to approve the power purchase agreement be dismissed by the puc since the power purchase agreement had expired by its own terms 
in september  in response to mei s efforts to preserve its contractual rights  the puc  by court order  ordered wppc to execute a new power purchase agreement with mei 
the new power purchase agreement would include extended contract milestone dates and rates which would be recalculated due to the later start up date for this project necessitated by the delays caused by the appeal 
this order has been appealed by the same industrial intervenors and wppc through various courts  including the united states supreme court  and upheld in every case in favor of mei 
in august  the puc issued a tentative order for final contract rates 
the order had been temporarily stayed by mutual agreement of mei and wppc pending discussions pertaining to a buy out of the power purchase agreement which began in october and have not yet been finalized 
however  mei recently lifted the stay and is proceeding to finalize the terms of the power purchase agreement 
despite ongoing efforts to reach a buy out arrangement with wppc  the company has continued to invest its financial resources to protect its legal and contractual interests and to support its ability to commence construction in the event that a buy out arrangement under mutually agreeable terms cannot be reached with wppc 
in july  in furtherance of these objectives  the company entered into a joint development agreement with us gen 
us gen is a joint venture of pg e enterprises and bechtel enterprises  inc and has considerable experience as one of america s largest independent power companies 
in addition  the company and us gen have a history of working together in the co development and ongoing operation of the scrubgrass project which has now been operating profitably for more than a year 
as a result of the joint development agreement  the company has greater financial and technical resources available to pursue the development of the milesburg project 
since the signing of the joint development agreement  the company and us gen have been pursuing various development activities and are continuing ongoing discussions with wppc concerning a possible buy out of the power purchase agreement 
the company plans to continue efforts towards both the development of the milesburg project and the negotiation of a buy out of the power purchase agreement until it becomes apparent which alternative will be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders 
in that regard  the company s development efforts have increased in under the terms of the joint development agreement  us gen has the responsibility to manage the development activities and finance a majority of the development period expenses prior to financial closing 
based on the progress made in recent development activities and buy out negotiations  management believes that it is more likely than not that the company will recover its net investment in the milesburg project 
however  there can be no assurance that the milesburg project will be successfully developed  that the company will receive a buy out proposal  or that the company will realize any value from the milesburg project

competition the company generates electricity using alternative energy sources which is sold on a wholesale basis to utilities under contracted rates established in power purchase agreements 
there are a large number of suppliers in the wholesale market and a surplus of capacity which has led to intense competition in this market 
the principal sources of competition in this market include traditional utilities who have excess capacity  energy brokers and traders  contractors  equipment suppliers and other independent power producers who have entered  or are attempting to enter the energy market 
competition in this industry is substantially based on price with competitors discovering lower cost alternatives to providing electricity 
presently  the company does not believe it will be significantly impacted by competition in the wholesale energy market since its revenues are subject to contracted rates which are substantially fixed for several years 
however  the contracted rates in the later years of the scrubgrass and milesburg power purchase agreements switch to rates which vary more closely with existing market conditions 
should ensuing competition in the later years of the company s power purchase agreements create downward pressure on wholesale energy rates  the company s profitability could be impacted 
the company also competes in the market to develop power generation facilities 
the primary bases of competition in this market are quality of development plans  ability including financial ability of the developer to complete the project and the price to be paid for the development opportunity 
in certain cases  competitive bidding for a development opportunity is required 
competition for attractive development opportunities is expected to be intense as there are a number of competitors in the industry interested in the limited number of such opportunities 
many of the companies competing in this market have substantially greater resources than the company 
the company believes its project development experience and its experience in creating strategic alignments with other development firms with greater financial and technical resources could enable it to continue to compete effectively in the development market when opportunities arise 
however  the company believes it has limited opportunities for additional project development in the united states for the foreseeable future 
regulation the company s projects are subject to regulation under federal and state energy laws and regulations and federal  state and local environmental and mining laws and regulations 
the company s facilities are either self certified as a qualifying facility under the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa  or formally certified as a qualifying facility by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
pursuant to purpa  ferc has promulgated regulations which exempt certain qualifying facilities from the federal power act of  the public utility holding company act of  and  except under certain limited circumstances  state laws regulating the rates charged by electric utilities 
in order to qualify under purpa  the company s facilities must meet certain size  fuel and ownership requirements and or co generate 
in addition to regulation of qualifying facilities  purpa requires that electric utilities purchase electric energy produced by qualifying facilities at negotiated rates or at a price equal to the incremental or avoided cost that would have been incurred by the utility if it were to generate the power itself or purchase it from another source 
the company s projects must also comply with applicable federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment  primarily in the areas of water and air pollution 
as regulations are enacted or adopted the company cannot predict the effect of compliance therewith on its business 
failure to comply with all applicable requirements could result in required modifications to facilities including the inability to operate during periods of non compliances 
the company is responsible for ensuring compliance of its facilities with all applicable requirements and  accordingly  attempts to minimize these risks by dealing with reputable contractors 
the company is not presently subject to regulation under the public utility holding company act of the company does not presently intend to engage in any activities that would cause it to be so regulated 
the commonwealth of pennsylvania has recently passed legislation which significantly restructures the electric industry  primarily in the retail market  beginning in presently  none of this recently passed legislation directly impacts the company

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of the company the company owns a year leasehold interest in an approximately mw net waste coal fired electric generating facility the scrubgrass project located in pennsylvania  the lease for which commenced on june  until december  the company also held varying ownership interests to approximately in and oversaw the operation of an approximately mw net waste coal fired electric generating facility the sunnyside project located in utah 
the company has one additional project the milesburg project in the development stage  but believes that it has limited opportunities for additional similar project development in the united states for the foreseeable future 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compares the company s results of operations for the years ending december   and however  the following factors should be considered when reading this information which make the results of operations for each of these periods very different 
sunnyside operations the company owned varying majority interests from to approximately in the sunnyside project until september  and thereafter owned an approximate interest until december  when the company sold its remaining interest in the sunnyside project 
accordingly  during the year ended december   the company consolidated the results of operations of its majority interests in the sunnyside project until september  and reported its approximate interest in the sunnyside project during the period from september  to december  under the equity method 
as a result of the sale of its interest in the sunnyside project  the company recorded a gain on the sale of approximately million and recognized other income for management services and interest income aggregating approximately million which is included in other income in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company had previously earned these management fees and interest income from services and loans provided to sca but such amounts had been either eliminated in consolidation or deferred prior to the sale 
scrubgrass operations the company commenced a year lease of the scrubgrass project on june  accordingly  the company s results of operations include six months of operations of the scrubgrass project in and a full year of operations of the scrubgrass project for each of and cautionary statement this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  as defined by the private securities litigation reform act of  in order to provide investors with prospective information about the company 
for this purpose  any statements which are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors which could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  net income in amounted to  or cents per share as compared to a net loss of  or cents per share in the overall increase is primarily attributable to favorable operating performance of the scrubgrass project  the recognition of certain revenues of  which were previously deferred under the scrubgrass power purchase agreement  the settlement of a warranty issue related to the scrubgrass project for  and the settlement of a legal proceeding for approximately  net of legal fees 
in light of the company s favorable earnings in  the company paid dividends in of  or cents per share as compared to dividends paid in of  or cents per share 
power generation revenues in amounted to  as compared to  in the overall increase in power generation revenues during is primarily attributable to the recognition of certain revenues of  which were previously deferred under the scrubgrass power purchase agreement and an increase in the power generation and contracted rates billed to the utility 
the increase in power generation occurred primarily because the plant operated at of its capacity in as compared to of its capacity in the overall increase in power generation revenues was offset in part by a reduction in the revenue recorded as a result of the straight line accounting treatment of certain revenues under the power purchase agreement which amounted to  in as compared to  in all power generation revenues earned by the company in and related to the scrubgrass project 
operating expenses in amounted to  as compared to  in the overall increase is primarily due to higher fuel costs and operator fees because of the higher capacity rate in and the recognition of maintenance expenses associated with the anticipated repair of the scrubgrass generator see note o to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the repair to the scrubgrass generator 
during  due to maintenance modifications and additional operating experience  fuel costs were only of power generation revenues  as compared to of power generation revenues in moreover  the operating expenses incurred during the annual plant outage were significantly greater by comparison to those incurred during the annual plant outage 
for both of these reasons  the increase in operating expenses was not as significant as the increase in power generation revenues 
lease expense in amounted to  as compared to  in the overall increase in lease expense during is primarily due to an increase in equity rents paid to the lessor based on the favorable performance of the scrubgrass plant in the increase is partially offset by a decrease in the lease expense recorded as a result of the straight line accounting treatment of lease expenses  in as compared to  in and the lowering of interest rates which occurred in and which reduced the lessor s loan costs that were passed through to the company in its facility lease expenses 
general and administrative expenses in amounted to  as compared to  in the overall decrease in general and administrative expenses during is primarily due to the company s efforts to reduce its corporate overhead expenses 
the company s major steps to reduce its corporate overhead in included a consolidation of its vermont and new hampshire offices into one office in new hampshire  a reduction in its executive officer compensation and a reduction in its employee headcount by an equivalent of two full time employees 
however  during  the company continued to incur substantial management and professional fees to negotiate certain contractual matters and defend its position in certain legal matters 
accordingly  the full effect of the company s efforts to reduce corporate overhead expenses has not yet been shown in its operating results 
warranty income in amounted to  and resulted from a settlement with an engineering and construction contractor for the scrubgrass plant which was received in march there was no warranty income in other income in consisted primarily of proceeds from a legal settlement of  and sunnyside project sales tax refunds of approximately  arising out of activities prior to the date of sale 
other income in consisted primarily of sunnyside project sales tax refunds of million arising out of activities prior to the date of sale and fee income related to the scrubgrass project 
the other income in and were both offset in part by the provisions made for the continued decline in value of the company s preferred stock investment in hamilton technologies  inc  a privately held massachusetts developer of computer aided software engineering case software 
income tax expense in amounted to  as compared to an income tax benefit of  in the income tax expense resulted primarily from the company s favorable earnings during furthermore  in  the company s deferred state income tax expense includes a charge related to state net operating loss carryforwards which have expired and a charge related to a valuation allowance which was established because the company estimates that it may not realize all of the recorded tax benefits of its state net operating loss carryforwards 
the company s effective tax rate on its earnings amounted to as compared to an effective tax benefit rate of on its net loss in the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily as a result of the additional charges to deferred state tax expense and because the taxability of temporary differences reversing in occurred in states with higher tax rates 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  power generation revenues in amounted to  as compared to  in in  power generation revenues were all attributable to the scrubgrass project 
in  the company s power generation revenues were attributable to operations of the sunnyside project until september   and six months of operations of the scrubgrass project 
the overall increase in power generation revenues during is primarily attributable to a full year of operations of the scrubgrass project and an increase in the power generation and contracted rates billed to the utility for the scrubgrass project 
the increase in power generation occurred primarily because the scrubgrass plant operated at of its capacity in as compared to of its capacity in operating expenses in were  and related to the operation of the scrubgrass project for twelve months as compared to operating expenses of  in which related to the operation of the scrubgrass and sunnyside projects for six and nine months  respectively 
the overall increase is primarily due to the change in the mix of operating activities between projects during each period 
lease expense in amounted to  as compared to  in lease expense  which relates to the scrubgrass project  reflected an increase in primarily due to a full year of operations of the scrubgrass project 
general and administrative expenses in were  and include the operation of the scrubgrass project for twelve months as compared to operating expenses of  in which include the operation of the scrubgrass and sunnyside projects for six and nine months  respectively 
the overall increase is primarily due to the change in the mix of operating activities between projects during each period 
depreciation and amortization amounted to  in as compared to  in the decrease is primarily attributable to the absence of depreciation on the sunnyside facility in other income in was  and consisted primarily of sunnyside project sales tax refunds of million arising out of activities prior to the date of sale and fee income related to the scrubgrass project 
other income in was  and consisted primarily of the recognition of construction management and interest income related to the sunnyside project when such project was sold 
interest income amounted to  in as compared to  in the decrease is primarily due to the absence of the earnings on investment balances related to the sunnyside project 
interest expense amounted to  in as compared to  in the decrease was primarily attributable to the absence of sunnyside project debt obligations in since the company s interest in the sunnyside project was sold in in  the aggregate income from gain on sale of affiliate  minority interest and equity in net loss of affiliate amounted to  which related to the sunnyside project which was sold in december outlook during the fourth quarter of  after learning about a generator failure at an electric generating facility with an identical generator to the scrubgrass facility  the manufacturer asked the company to perform certain tests to determine the scrubgrass generator s condition 
based on the results of these tests  which became available during the first quarter of  the company believes the scrubgrass facility s generator exhibits certain conditions which indicate that a similar failure might occur at some time in the future 
in light of these test results  the generator manufacturer has recommended that the company perform a complete rewind on the scrubgrass facility s generator during its annual plant outage which is scheduled to begin in april while the extent of damage to the generator will not be known until the generator is disassembled and inspected during the annual plant outage  based on the generator test results  the generator manufacturer has advised the company that the complete rewind currently appears to be the best course of action to repair the anticipated damage  and to ensure the operation of the generator on a long term basis 
as a result of the recommended generator repair  the company currently estimates it would incur an additional expense of approximately  to perform the rewind procedure   of which was recorded in see note o to the consolidated financial statements  and would expect to lose net revenues which average approximately  per day for each additional day the facility is inoperative during the scheduled outage 
presently  the manufacturer of the generator has indicated that the rewind is expected to take no longer than days  which would necessitate that the scrubgrass plant be shutdown for days longer than the original shutdown planned by the facility operator 
the impact of the repair and extended shutdown on the company s operating results and or cash flows could be mitigated by a shortening of the repair period  recovery from the generator manufacturer  proceeds from insurance coverage  and or modifications to the scrubgrass project s financing 
however  there can be no assurance that any of such mitigating factors will occur 
see certain factors that may affect future results below 
until the generator repair is completed  it is not possible to accurately predict its effect on the company s results of operations in however  without giving effect to the negative impact of the generator repair on the company s operating results  the company s management expects that the company would still be less profitable in as compared to in  the company enjoyed the benefit of certain non recurring revenues including the recognition of  of revenues which were previously deferred under the scrubgrass power purchase agreement  the settlement of a warranty issue related to the scrubgrass project for  and the settlement of a legal proceeding for approximately  net of legal fees 
in addition  the company expects to incur additional lease expense in of approximately  as a result of a principal payment due on one of the lessor s term loans 
however  the company expects that the absence of the non recurring revenues and the impact of the additional lease expense would be partially offset by some factors with a favorable impact on its results of operations in these factors include an increase in certain power generation revenues resulting from an approximate increase in the contracted rates charged for energy produced by the scrubgrass project  a reduction in lease expense from anticipated lower equity rents and bank fees  and a reduction of general and administrative expenses largely because approximately  of such expenses incurred in are not expected to recur in furthermore  the company expects that a material portion of its expenses will continue to consist of non cash items  including deferred income taxes  maintenance reserves  and depreciation and amortization 
as such  although there can be no assurance that the company will continue to pay future dividends  the company expects that its cash generated from operations will continue to be greater than its operating results  which would enhance the likelihood that cash resources would be available for the payment of dividends 
recently issued accounting standards see note b to the consolidated financial statements for recently issued accounting standards which are required to be adopted in liquidity and capital resources operating activities operating activities continue to be the company s principal source of liquidity with cash provided by operating activities amounting to  in as compared to  in during  the company primarily generated cash from operating activities from the operating profits of the scrubgrass project  from investment earnings  from the settlement of a warranty issue related to the scrubgrass project for  and from the settlement of a legal proceeding for approximately  net of legal fees 
during  the company s cash from operating activities primarily came from proceeds received from the sale of sunnyside project  from investment earnings and from the receipt of sales tax refunds related to the sunnyside project arising out of activities prior to the date of the sale 
the following changes in operating assets and liabilities most notably impacted cash provided by operating activities receivable from utility the company s receivable from utility relates to the scrubgrass project and amounted to  as of december  as compared to  as of december  the decrease is largely attributable to a nonrecurring receivable amounting to  at december  which primarily pertained to the utility s payment of a portion of the contracted rates for energy produced by the scrubgrass plant in excess of mw in any hour 
deferred income tax asset the company s deferred income tax asset amounted to  as of december  as compared to  as of december  the decrease is largely attributable to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of the tax benefits associated with deferred revenue which were both recorded for the year ended december  other current liabilities the company s other current liabilities amounted to  as of december  as compared to  at december  the increase is primarily due to additional borrowings from the working capital loan to pay scrubgrass expenses 
the company believes that the balance of the working capital loan was lower than average as of december  since the company had just refinanced approximately million of its current liabilities in december the increase was offset in part by the repayment of the current portion of the scrubgrass note obligation in the amount of  deferred gain  net the company s deferred gain  net amounted to  as of december  as compared to  as of december  the decline is due to the amortization of the deferred gain related to the scrubgrass project  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
deferred revenue the company s deferred revenue  which represents power generation revenues of the scrubgrass project which were deferred pursuant to conditions set forth in the power purchase agreement  amounted to as of december  as compared to  as of december  the decrease is attributable to power generation revenues which were earned during the year ended december  maintenance reserve the company s maintenance reserve  which relates to the scrubgrass project  increased to  as of december  from  as of december  due to scheduled reserves provided for the ongoing maintenance of the plant and an additional provision in light of the anticipated repair to the generator 
investing activities the company utilized  and  for investing activities during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s investing activities are concentrated primarily in the following areas notes receivable the company presently has notes receivable related to the sale of the sunnyside project and related to fees earned in for the scrubgrass project 
the company collected  from notes receivable related to the scrubgrass project in and collected  from notes receivable related to the sunnyside project in the notes receivable related to the sunnyside project  with a principal balance of  and accrued interest balance of  as of december   are the subject of a legal proceeding 
see certain factors that may impact future results  item and note n to the company s consolidated financial statements for further information 
restricted cash the company is presently required to make scheduled deposits to a major maintenance fund to ensure that funds are available in the future for scheduled maintenance procedures 
during  scheduled deposits and interest earned on the major maintenance fund aggregated property plant and equipment the company invested  in and  in in property plant and equipment expenditures 
the expenditures primarily relate to development activities for the company s milesburg project for which development efforts increased in financing activities the company utilized  and  in financing activities during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s financing activities are concentrated primarily in the following areas dividends the company declared and paid its first dividend of cents per share in december which amounted to  prior to that date  the company s policy had been to retain earnings  if any  for use in its business 
beginning in  the company initiated a quarterly dividend policy which is subject to review and consideration by the board of directors each quarter 
in respect of this dividend policy  the company declared and paid quarterly dividends of cents per share and a special year end dividend of cents per share resulting in aggregate dividends of  paid in treasury stock the company from time to time makes purchases of its own common stock 
during  the company purchased  shares of common stock from a resigning executive officer for  representing all of the officer s holdings in the company 
the company s note receivable from the officer in the amount of  was collected by reducing the proceeds paid to the officer for the common stock 
the company also paid  for open market purchases made during notes payable the company presently has long term obligations related to its milesburg project and scrubgrass project in the amount of  and  respectively 
the company also had short term installment obligations related to its sunnyside project and milesburg project which were fully satisfied by aggregate payments of  and  during and  respectively 
the milesburg project long term obligations are noninterest bearing and payable only under certain conditions  the most significant of which relates to the closing of construction financing and commencement of construction for the milesburg project 
the next installment for the scrubgrass project long term obligation is not due until outlook during  the company expects that its principal sources of cash to fund its business activities will be from available cash balances  investment earnings and cash which may become available from the scrubgrass project 
as discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements  the company is not able to receive cash from the scrubgrass project until all operating expenses  base lease payments which include the lessor s debt service  certain maintenance reserve payments and other subordinated payments of the scrubgrass project are first satisfied 
furthermore  as described in this item under results of operations outlook and in note o to the consolidated financial statements  the company expects to make significant repairs to the generator of the scrubgrass project during its annual plant outage 
if the company were required to fund the proposed generator repairs and lost net revenues on an immediate basis  the company would expect to experience a significant cash shortfall beginning shortly after the annual plant outage 
however  based on recent discussions with the scrubgrass project s lending institutions and generator manufacturer  the company currently expects that it may be able to spread the financial impact of the generator repair over a period ranging from four to six years through debt financing or through extended terms with the generator manufacturer 
furthermore  in light of the favorable performance of the scrubgrass project which is expected to resume once the necessary generator repairs are made  the company expects that the scrubgrass project will be capable of supporting the increases in the debt service requirements proposed under the generator repair financing scenarios without compromising any of its existing debt covenants 
as such  the company expects that it will receive sufficient cash from the scrubgrass project  which when combined with its available cash balances and investment earnings  would be sufficient to sustain it business activities on a long term basis 
however  there can be no assurance that the financial impact of the generator repair can be spread over a number of years or that the favorable performance of the scrubgrass project will continue 
see certain factors that may affect future results below 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k 
ownership of single operating asset the company owns a year leasehold interest in the scrubgrass project  an approximate mw net waste coal fired electric generating facility located in pennsylvania  the lease for which commenced on june  presently  all the company s operating revenues are attributable to power generation from the scrubgrass project 
accordingly  the company s operations are largely dependent upon the successful and continued operation of the scrubgrass project 
in particular  if the scrubgrass project experiences unscheduled shutdowns of significant duration  the company s results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
dependence upon key employees the success of the company is largely dependent upon a staff of four employees  including three executive officers 
the loss of any of these employees could adversely effect the company s operations 
third party project management the company has entered into a management services agreement with us gen to manage the scrubgrass project and a year operations and maintenance agreement with us operating services to operate the facility 
under the terms of these agreements  there are provisions which limit the company s participation in the management and operation of the scrubgrass project  and provisions which provide for recourse against the manager and operator for unsatisfactory performance 
however  the company does not exercise control over the operation or management of the scrubgrass project 
as such  decisions may be made affecting the scrubgrass project  notwithstanding the company s opposition  which may have an adverse affect on the company 
scheduled and unscheduled shutdowns the scrubgrass project from time to time experiences both scheduled and unscheduled shutdowns 
periodically  the scrubgrass project incurs scheduled shutdowns in order to perform maintenance procedures to equipment that cannot be performed while the equipment is operating 
occasionally  the scrubgrass project may also incur unscheduled shutdowns or may be required to operate at reduced capacity levels following the detection of equipment malfunctions  or following minimum generation orders received by the utility 
during periods when the scrubgrass project is shutdown or operating at reduced capacity levels  the company may incur losses due to the loss of its operating revenues and or due to additional costs which may be required to complete any maintenance procedures 
it is not possible for the company to predict the frequency of future unscheduled shutdowns or to predict the extent of maintenance which may be required during shutdowns related to equipment maintenance 
as previously discussed in this item  the scrubgrass plant is scheduled to shut down in april for its annual plant outage 
during this scheduled outage  the plant operator will be performing significant repairs to the generator 
the company s expected operating results could be affected if the duration of the outage or the maintenance expenses incurred during the outage exceed the company s expectations 
legal proceedings as discussed in item and note n to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company is involved in a legal proceeding with the purchasers of the company s interest in the sunnyside project which was sold in pending the resolution of the legal proceeding  the purchasers have withheld scheduled payments of principal and interest due on the promissory notes since june  which amounted to  and  respectively as of december  in addition  the company recorded in a receivable related to a purchase price adjustment  as provided for in the purchase and sale agreement  of approximately million  of which  was received in april the balance of purchase price adjustment is also being disputed in the legal proceeding with the purchasers 
although the company s cash provided by operating activities has been sufficient to fund the company s investing and financing activities  the withholding of scheduled principal and interest payments has adversely affected the company s cash flow 
at this time  while management believes the company s position in this litigation is meritorious  the company cannot predict whether it will prevail in the litigation and to what extent it will incur professional fees to defend its position in the litigation 
an unfavorable resolution and or extensive professional fees to defend the litigation could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
financial results to date the company has incurred substantial losses  primarily due to its development activities  which have resulted in an accumulated deficit of  as of december  in addition  except during when the scrubgrass project became profitable  the company has incurred losses in recent years 
financial results can be affected by numerous factors  including without limitation general economic conditions  cyclic industry conditions  the amount and rate of growth of expenses  transportation and quality of raw materials  inflation  levels of energy rates  uncertainties relating to government and regulatory policies  the legal environment and volatile and unpredictable developments 
the company believes it is well positioned to handle such matters as they may arise during the course of its future business activities 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable in the future 
development uncertainties the company is currently pursuing efforts towards either the development of the milesburg project or the negotiation of a buy out of the milesburg project s power purchase agreement with west penn power company 
however  there can be no assurance that the milesburg project will be successfully developed  that the company will receive a buy out proposal  or that the company will realize any value from the milesburg project 
in the event the company and its joint development partner  us gen  seek to continue development efforts  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain all of the necessary site agreements  fuel supply contracts  design build agreements  power sales contracts  licenses  environmental and other permits  local government approvals or financing commitments required for the successful completion of this project 
to date  the company s efforts to develop the milesburg project have been proceeding on schedule 
however  the failure to accomplish any of the aforementioned steps could materially increase the cost or prevent the successful completion of the milesburg project  or cause the company to abandon the milesburg project and incur the loss of its investment to date  which could materially impact the company s business and results of operations 
project financing the milesburg project  if successfully developed  will require substantial financing 
presently  the company has discussed financing proposals with certain financing sources and believes the milesburg project could be financed 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing can be successfully arranged 
any such financing is likely to be collateralized by the assets of the milesburg project  with repayment to be from the revenues attributable to the milesburg project 
the company may also be required to guarantee all or a portion of the project debt or may be required to give up significant equity interests in the milesburg project in order to arrange the financing 
potential liability  damages and insurance the company s power generation activities involve significant risks to the company for environmental damage  equipment damage and failures  personal injury and fines and costs imposed by regulatory agencies 
in the event a liability claim is made against the company  or if there is an extended outage or equipment failure or damage at the company s power plant for which it is inadequately insured or subject to a coverage exclusion  and the company is unable to defend such claim successfully or obtain indemnification or warranty recoveries  there may be a material adverse effect on the company 
circulating fluidized bed technology the company s scrubgrass project employs circulating fluidized bed technology to produce electricity 
certain aspects of this technology  as well as the conversion of waste products into electricity  are relatively new areas being explored by the alternative energy market in the last ten years 
accordingly  this technology carries greater risk than more established methods of power generation such as hydropower 
as such  the long term costs and implications of maintaining this technology have not been established by historical industry data 
customer concentration the company s power generation revenues are earned under a long term power purchase agreement with one customer  pennsylvania electric company 
the company expects that the concentration of its revenues with this customer will continue for the foreseeable future 
although  the company s milesburg project is in the development stage and presents an opportunity in the future for the company to expand its revenue sources and lessen its revenue concentration 
however  there can be no assurance that the milesburg project will be successfully developed 
interest rates the company s subsidiary  as a lease cost of the scrubgrass facility  is required to fund the lessor s debt service which primarily consists of million of variable rate tax exempt bonds maturing in  a million term loan maturing in  a million variable rate term loan maturing in and million in remaining junior subordinated debt obligations which mature through the company s subsidiary is also required to fund a variable rate working capital loan and a million variable rate term loan maturing in the lessor entered into interest rate swaps which had the effect of fixing the interest rate on the tax exempt bonds until may  at approximately and fixing the interest rate over the life of the million term loan at 
after may   the company s specified base rent was incurred based on floating rates on the lessor s tax exempt bonds 
as such  except for the lessor s million term loan and million remaining junior subordinated debt obligations  the company will be required to fund debt service consisting of rates which will vary with market conditions 
presently  the company is not able to predict how future interest rates will affect its lease expense or debt service 
should market interest rates rise significantly  the company s operating results may be significantly impacted 
notwithstanding  the company believes the lessor has good relationships with the project lenders who would continue to support lending terms which would not have a material adverse affect on the operating results of the scrubgrass project 
however  there can be no assurance that the lessor could renegotiate its credit facilities under terms which would ensure continuing profitable operating results of the scrubgrass project 
fuel quality the company obtains coal tailings primarily from coal mining companies on a long term basis because coal tailings are plentiful and generally create environmental hazards  such as acid drainage  when not disposed of properly 
the coal tailings are burned in the scrubgrass facility using a circulating fluidized bed combustion system 
during the circulating fluidized bed combustion process  the coal tailings are treated with other substances such as limestone to facilitate the breakdown of the coal tailings and the resulting power generation process 
depending on the quality of the coal tailings  the facility operator may need to add additional coal tailings or other substances to create the appropriate consistency of fuel for maximum power generation 
therefore  the cost of generating power is directly impacted by the quality of the coal tailings which supply the scrubgrass power generation facility 
the facility operator maintains certain controls over obtaining higher quality coal tailings 
however certain conditions  such as poor weather  can create situations where the facility operator has less control over the quality of the coal tailings 
the company cannot predict the extent to which poor fuel quality may impact its future operating results 
competition the company generates electricity using alternative energy sources which is sold on a wholesale basis to utilities under contracted rates established in power purchase agreements 
there are a large number of suppliers in the wholesale market and a surplus of capacity which has led to intense competition in this market 
the principal sources of competition in this market include traditional utilities who have excess capacity  energy traders and brokers  contractors  equipment suppliers and other independent power producers who have entered  or are attempting to enter the energy market 
competition in this industry is substantially based on price with competitors discovering lower cost alternatives to providing electricity 
presently  the company does not believe it will be significantly impacted by competition in the wholesale energy market since its revenues are subject to contracted rates which are substantially fixed for several years 
however  the contracted rates in the later years of the scrubgrass project and milesburg project power purchase agreements switch to rates which vary more closely with existing market conditions 
should ensuing competition in the later years of the company s power purchase agreements create downward pressure on wholesale energy rates  the company s profitability could be impacted 
the company also competes in the market to develop power generation facilities 
the primary bases of competition in this market are quality of development plans  ability including financial ability of the developer to complete the project and the price to be paid for the development opportunity 
in certain cases  competitive bidding for a development opportunity is required 
competition for attractive development opportunities is expected to be intense as there are a number of competitors in the industry interested in the limited number of such opportunities 
many of the companies competing in this market have substantially greater resources than the company 
the company believes its project development experience and its experience in creating strategic alignments with other development firms with greater financial and technical resources could enable it to continue to compete effectively in the development market as development opportunities arise 
however  the company believes it has limited opportunities for additional project development in the united states for the foreseeable future 
regulation the company s projects benefit from regulation under federal and state energy laws and regulations which require electric utilities to purchase energy produced by qualifying facilities 
the company also benefits from and must comply with certain regulations enacted pursuant to the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa exempting certain qualifying facilities from certain provisions of the federal power act of  the public utility holding company act of  and  except under certain limited circumstances  state laws regulating the wholesale rates charged by electric utilities 
the company cannot predict the affect on its business if these laws or regulations are amended or repealed 
the company s projects must also comply with applicable federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment  primarily in the areas of water and air pollution 
as regulations are enacted or adopted the company cannot predict the effect of compliance therewith on its business 
failure to comply with all applicable requirements could result in required modifications to facilities including the inability to operate during periods of non compliances 
the company is responsible to ensure compliance of its facilities with all applicable requirements and  accordingly  attempts to minimize these risks by dealing with reputable contractors 
the commonwealth of pennsylvania has recently passed legislation which significantly restructures the electric industry  primarily in the retail market  beginning in presently  none of this recently passed legislation directly impacts the company 
however  the company cannot predict whether its operating or development activities will be indirectly impacted by any such legislation in the future
