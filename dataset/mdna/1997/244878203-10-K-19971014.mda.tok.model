net earnings for fiscal were million per share compared with million per share in fiscal all three business segments reported higher profitability compared with the prior year 
in north america  improved corn unit margins combined with higher soybean volume resulted in a percent improvement in earnings 
international seed segment earnings doubled from fiscal to fiscal largely due to sales volume and margin increases in argentina and mexico 
in addition  swine segment earnings improved as a result of an increase in breeding stock sales combined with higher market hog prices 
during fiscal  revenues rose percent million versus million as corn average selling prices in north america and argentina increased primarily due to a significant portion of sales volume shifting to higher price categories thus contributing to stronger unit margins 
this increase was a result of a increase in international revenues combined with a improvement in north american revenues 
north american soybean revenues increased driven largely by a increase in sales volume 
swine segment revenues increased as a result of increased breeding stock sales accompanied by higher market hog prices 
net earnings for fiscal were million per share compared with million per share in fiscal earnings from continuing operations were million higher million versus million in fiscal than in fiscal the percent increase was primarily due to higher north american corn and soybean sales volumes combined with higher corn sales volumes in argentina  the net receipt of million from the monsanto company monsanto collaboration agreement  and the absence of devaluation losses in mexico which occurred in fiscal swine segment earnings for fiscal improved million over fiscal market hog prices rebounded significantly  but were partly offset by lower breeding stock sales  reflecting a continuing soft demand for breeding stock that began in fiscal fiscal revenues were million  up over percent from million in fiscal north american seed revenues increased percent and international seed revenues were up percent while swine revenues decreased slightly 
in fiscal  north american seed revenues increased nine percent and international revenues were up by percent  while swine revenues decreased nearly percent from the previous year 
fourth quarter the net loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million per share was higher when compared with the prior year fourth quarter loss of million per share  however  the sources differed from year to year 
the fiscal loss was largely due to corporate and administrative expenses coupled with higher than expected corn seed returns  more than offsetting late season soybean sales 
the fiscal loss primarily reflected corporate and administrative expenses 
in fiscal higher seed earnings from late soybean sales were offset by higher corporate and interest expenses when compared with fiscal losses are typical for dekalb in the fourth quarter because that period primarily reflects corporate and interest expenses and adjustments related to estimated full year seed returns and expenses recorded in the previous nine months 
full year industry segment revenues and pre tax earnings in millions years ended august revenues north american seed international seed swine pre tax earnings north american seed international seed swine general corporate expenses interest expense  net north american seed segment earnings for north american seed increased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as revenues increased percent over fiscal due to higher selling prices for both corn and soybeans  together with increased soybean volume and third party royalties 
the results reflect the third year of an upward trend in earnings which began in corn revenues in fiscal were over nine percent higher as average corn selling prices increased over seven percent due to favorable mix and price increases 
corn unit margins increased over per unit as a result of the higher net selling prices and lower production costs 
dekalb market share momentum continued as the company added share in in the us corn belt 
over the past four years dekalb has added approximately share points in north america 
dekalb s north american market share is about 
soybean revenues increased percent on a sales volume increase of nearly 
the contribution of the soybean product line to segment earnings has continued to climb over the past three years due to increases in acreage  planting rate and market share 
in fiscal  the strong demand for dekalb varieties continued and was enhanced with the introduction and acceptance of roundup readyo soybeans 
roundup readyo is a trademark of monsanto company 
in addition  third party royalties were an increasing source of revenues in as demand for dekalb specialty trait products made their entrance into the north american corn market 
royalties which depend on sales by third parties were accrued in the second and third quarters consistent with the historical pattern of industry sales 
in fiscal  north american seed earnings increased percent to million from million in fiscal as revenues rose nearly thirty percent from increased corn and soybean sales volumes 
corn sales volume climbed percent during fiscal improved demand for dekalb corn hybrids continued as north american corn market share rose one percentage point in fiscal to percent  and as much as two to three percentage points in key us cornbelt areas 
an increase of percent in us corn planted acreage also contributed to the volume increase 
fiscal corn margin decreased over per unit 
average selling price increased six percent  which was more than offset by higher production costs 
corn unit costs rose almost from the previous fiscal year due to adverse planting and growing conditions during the summer production season combined with higher winter production costs 
partly offsetting increased production cost was lower discard costs resulting from aggressive supply utilization 
in fiscal  sorghum revenues and sales volume decreased slightly from the levels when sorghum planted acreage expanded percent over fiscal in  farmers shifted to sorghum as a replacement for failed winter wheat crops in combination with significantly better market prices  which made sorghum production more profitable 
although the demand for sorghum resulted in a tight supply of dekalb hybrids  dekalb maintained its leading market share position in international seed international seed segment earnings rose million during fiscal to million 
operations in latin america were primarily responsible for the significant earnings improvements along with a return to profitability in italy 
fiscal segment earnings for international seed increased million when compared with fiscal the primary factors were improved earnings from latin america and africa  partly offset by lower earnings in europe 
significant improvements in fiscal latin american segment earnings continued to build on the momentum that began in fiscal higher corn margins were driven largely by a increase in revenues  as a result of increased sales volume of percent accompanied by higher average selling prices  factors contributing to the argentine earnings improvement of million from the previous year 
increased demand for single cross corn hybrids generated a volume mix shift to higher priced products 
higher corn and sorghum sales volumes generated improved earnings in mexico million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal 
latin american segment earnings in fiscal were significantly improved from the prior year 
results from mexico were up million from the previous year s loss which resulted  in part  from the devaluation of the peso 
higher sorghum selling prices combined with significant sales volume growth resulted in improved sorghum revenues 
planted sorghum acreage in mexico increased by percent which contributed to the higher sales volume 
argentine corn sales volume rose percent in fiscal from the previous year as planted acreage increased percent 
restricted argentine corn supply resulted in a percentage point loss of market share 
a return to profitability in italy occurred in  following back to back losses in fiscal years and in fiscal  sales increased in all product lines  with soybeans being the main contributor 
fiscal suffered from a supply constraint of competitive corn products and from higher production costs which caused a greater loss in that year as compared to fiscal during  international operations in africa benefited from increased royalty revenues  while operations in asia captured additional market share in japan  korea  and china during fiscal through licensing programs in thailand  indonesia  and vietnam  the company strengthened its market position with increased sales volumes 
world wide seed patents  trademarks  united states certificates of plant variety protection  foreign plant registrations and licenses to use genetic material and or intellectual property are growing in importance  to the seed industry in general and to the business of dekalb seed 
while no single patent is currently of material importance to the company s seed business  the fact that a significant number of patents have been issued to the company in the area of biotechnology is considered to be an important factor relating to the future ability to commercialize genetically engineered products and to enable the company to enter into royalty generating license agreements with third parties 
dekalb seed s policy is to fully protect its inventions  discoveries and intellectual property 
see item legal proceedings 
dekalb seed has incurred and expects to continue to incur legal expenses associated with the ongoing enforcement of its patents 
seed segment earnings will continue to be affected by a variety of factors in both domestic and international markets including the company s relative product performance and competitive market position  weather conditions  commodity prices and trade policies 
swine swine segment earnings increased during fiscal to million from million in fiscal  while revenues increased percent from million in fiscal to million in fiscal strong demand for newly improved dekalb swine genetics resulted in breeding stock revenues increasing percent on a percent increase in volume 
in addition  continued improvement in top market hog prices to in fiscal from in fiscal led to an percent increase in market revenues on a five percent increase in volume 
the increase in fiscal segment earnings compared to fiscal was primarily due to the rebound of the top market hog price received by dekalb from in fiscal to in fiscal partly offsetting market hog price improvements in fiscal was lower breeding stock volume down percent  resulting in part from soft demand caused by an unfavorable hog corn price ratio for producers 
general general corporate expenses over the past three years have continued to increase primarily due to the enhancement of employee benefit programs 
fiscal net interest expense decreased million from fiscal due to lower average corporate borrowing requirements 
net interest expense decreased million in fiscal from fiscal due to the reduced need for short term debt as a result of the cash infusion from the monsanto transaction 
the effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to the effect of international operations and the reenactment of the research and development tax credit 
in fiscal  the effective tax rate increased to from in fiscal the main reason for the increase was the unavailability of the research and development tax credit during that year 
on january   dekalb entered into a series of agreements with monsanto  including an agreement which provides the framework for a long term research and development collaboration with monsanto in the field of agricultural biotechnology  particularly corn seed 
dekalb and monsanto also entered into cross licensing agreements covering insect resistant and herbicide tolerant corn products 
the two companies will share the royalties received from third parties relating to the patents covered by such cross licensing agreements
