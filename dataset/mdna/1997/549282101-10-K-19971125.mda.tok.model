item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources during the last three years the company has funded all capital expenditures from internally generated funds  cash equivalents  short term borrowings  and long term debt 
capital expenditures for fiscal were  a increase from fiscal this increase resulted from the opening of new cafeterias in fiscal  including two relocations  as compared to in fiscal  which included one relocation 
fiscal capital expenditures included the purchase of locations from triangle foodservice corporation  formerly wyatt cafeterias  inc  for approximately million in cash 
after additional capital expenditures of approximately million to repair and refurbish these units  of the locations were opened as luby s and are included in the new openings in fiscal in addition  the company purchased eight sites as land held for future use  which was the same number of land sites purchased during fiscal plans for fiscal include the opening of approximately seven new cafeterias five on sites owned by the company  one on land held under a long term ground lease  and one in a regional shopping mall 
in addition to the recurring capital expenditures in existing locations  the company expects fiscal capital expenditures to include approximately to million related to upgrading the cafeteria information systems 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company identified several properties which it no longer intends to use for future cafeteria development  therefore  the sites are now held for sale 
the company anticipates that proceeds from the sale of these properties will partially offset future capital requirements 
as part of a joint venture agreement with waterstreet  inc signed in january  the company opened one seafood restaurant in fiscal on property held under a long term ground lease 
two seafood restaurants are planned to open in fiscal  both on sites owned by the company 
these water street seafood company restaurants will be leased by the joint venture from the company and operated by waterstreet  inc as of august   the company owned three undeveloped cafeteria sites  and several land site acquisitions were in varying stages of negotiation 
as a result of fewer new store openings planned for next year  the company expects a decrease in total capital expenditures for fiscal construction costs for new cafeterias and seafood restaurants are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations  cash currently held in cash equivalent investments  and long term debt 
the company generated cash from operations of  in fiscal the company had a balance of  outstanding at august   under a  credit facility with a syndication of four banks 
at august   the company had a working capital deficit of  which compares to the prior year s working capital deficit of  the working capital position improved during fiscal due primarily to the increase in cash and cash equivalents of  the company typically carries current liabilities in excess of current assets because cash generated from operating activities is reinvested in capital expenditures 
the board of directors authorized the purchase in the open market of up to  shares of the company s outstanding common stock through december   of which  shares were purchased in fiscal under this and a previous authorization  the company purchased a total of  shares of its common stock during fiscal at a cost of  which are being held as treasury stock 
the company believes that funds generated from operations and short term or long term financing from external sources  which can be obtained on terms acceptable to the company  are adequate for its foreseeable needs 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales increased  or  due to the addition of new cafeterias in fiscal and cafeterias in fiscal the average sales volume of cafeterias opened over one year decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to a negative trend in customer counts 
this trend was a result of intense competition in the restaurant industry and sales transfer from our established cafeterias caused by the significant number of fiscal and openings in our existing markets 
the impact of the same store customer count decline was partially offset by a increase in average tray revenues 
the company implemented a price increase on september   to help offset the pressure on profit margins from the increase in the federal minimum wage 
cost of food increased  or  due primarily to the increase in sales 
payroll and related costs increased  or  due primarily to the increase in sales  the increase in the federal minimum wage which became effective october   and higher wage costs associated with increased expansion over the prior year 
although a price increase was implemented to help offset higher wage rates  the decline in same store sales experienced during fiscal resulted in significant pressure on labor costs 
with the subsequent increase of the federal minimum wage on september   the company expects continued pressure on labor costs during fiscal this should be partially mitigated by fewer new store openings since labor costs are typically higher during the first year of operation 
occupancy and other operating expenses increased  or  due primarily to the increase in sales and the opening of new cafeterias 
preopening expenses and start up costs  which are expensed as incurred  totaled approximately million for new openings in fiscal the decline in same store sales caused fixed costs within this expense category to increase as a percent of sales 
however  managers salaries  which are based on the profitability of the cafeterias  decreased as a percent of sales due to lower store profits 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or 
as a result of lower earnings  the company s contribution to the profit sharing plan totaled million  or million less than fiscal this decrease was partially offset by retirement costs  executive search firm fees  and higher legal and professional fees associated with the company s restructuring into a holding company 
in addition  manager trainee salaries and moving expenses were higher than fiscal due to the increased expansion 
during fiscal the company adopted financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and recorded a million pretax charge during the fourth quarter 
the charge included million for the closing of four cafeterias  million for the write down of certain cafeteria properties which the company plans to continue to operate  the write down of million for surplus properties the company plans to sell  million for the write down of computer hardware  and million for various other charges 
interest expense of  for fiscal was incurred in conjunction with borrowings under the credit facility and is net of  capitalized on qualifying properties 
the increase over fiscal of  or  was due to higher average outstanding borrowings relating to the increase in expansion during fiscal and the purchase of treasury stock 
the provision for income taxes decreased  or  due to lower income before income taxes and lower state taxes resulting from the company s restructuring into a holding company 
the company s effective income tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal a portion of the decline in the provision for income taxes in fiscal is nonrecurring since it resulted from lowering the deferred tax liability based on a lower expected state tax rate 
the company anticipates that the effective tax rate will be approximately for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal sales increased  or  due in part to the addition of new cafeterias in fiscal and cafeterias in fiscal the average sales volume of cafeterias opened over one year increased slightly to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to higher average tray revenues over the prior year 
the same store customer count trend was negative for the first time since this decline was not wholly unexpected because all but four of the fiscal openings occurred in existing markets 
accordingly  our market share improved in these areas  however  customer traffic and sales at established cafeterias were negatively impacted 
this  combined with increased competition and the lack of full recovery from the peso devaluation in fiscal  resulted in the negative same store customer count trend 
cost of food increased  or  due primarily to the increase in sales 
food cost margins improved from the price increase on the lu ann platter  which took effect on december  payroll and related costs increased  or  due primarily to the increase in sales  higher wages for hourly employees in existing cafeterias  and higher wage costs associated with increased expansion over the prior year 
occupancy and other operating expenses increased  or  due primarily to the increase in sales and the opening of new cafeterias 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  due primarily to two additional area vice president positions  higher management trainee salaries  and higher moving expenses  all associated with the increased expansion 
interest expense of  for fiscal was incurred in conjunction with borrowings under the credit facility and is net of  capitalized on qualifying properties 
the increase over fiscal of  or  was due to higher average outstanding borrowings 
the provision for income taxes increased  or  due to higher income before income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal new accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share  which is required to be adopted for financial statements issued after december  at that time  the company will be required to change the method currently used to compute earnings per share and to restate all prior periods 
under the new requirements for calculating basic earnings per share  the dilutive effect of stock options will be excluded 
the change is not expected to have a material impact on the company s earnings per share 
inflation the company s policy is to maintain stable menu prices without regard to seasonal variations in food costs 
general increases in costs of food  wages  supplies  and services make it necessary for the company to increase its menu prices from time to time 
to the extent prevailing market conditions allow  the company intends to adjust menu prices to maintain profit margins
