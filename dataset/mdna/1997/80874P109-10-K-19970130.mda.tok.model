selected balance sheet data end of period total assets      total long term debt  including current installments      stockholders equity deficiency      weighted average shares outstanding      item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background historically  the company s revenues have come from two sources service revenue pursuant to multi year contracts to provide wagering systems and other services  which are typically based on handle  and sales contracts for wagering equipment and software 
the first quarter of the fiscal year is traditionally the weakest for service revenue 
sales revenue usually reflects a limited number of large transactions which do not recur on an annual basis  but which historically have given rise to additional terminal and systems software sales to existing customers 
the company s ability to expand is dependent upon its ability to attract new customers while fulfilling and retaining its existing contracts 
the sale and delivery of wagering systems and equipment for its international operations depend on various factors  including customer requirements as to the capabilities and features of the system and the delivery schedule 
consequently  revenue and operating results could vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of revenue recognition for major equipment sales 
the timing of these sales can affect not only annual performance  but can make quarterly results highly variable and unpredictable 
in the event the company is unable to attract new international customers to purchase its wagering systems and related equipment in the future at historic levels  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company has  in part  implemented its strategy of expanding its operations into all areas of the pari mutuel and lottery wagering businesses by making a number of strategic acquisitions 
these acquisitions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
since all but one of these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases  the timing of each acquisition affects the comparability of operations from period to period

million for costs incurred in connection with the company s unsuccessful third quarter debt offering  and charges in selling  general and administrative expense of 
million for contractual payments related to the departure of the president of the company 
partially offsetting these costs was the reversal of 
million of restructuring cost accruals because of the company s current plan to continue limited manufacturing of wagering terminals at its ireland manufacturing facility 
in fiscal  the company recorded million of unusual charges resulting principally from the company s restructuring charges and from certain asset valuation adjustments  which costs have been allocated among the pari mutuel operations million and lottery operations million 
the restructuring charges totaled million and were attributable to the closing of the lottery operations support facility in owings mills  maryland and the scaling back of certain international activities  including the planned closing of the company s manufacturing facility in ballymahon  ireland

 accounting for stock based compensation 
this pronouncement permits the company to choose either a new fair value based method or the current apb opinion intrinsic value based method of accounting for its stock based compensation arrangements
