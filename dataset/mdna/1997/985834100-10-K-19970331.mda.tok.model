item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes certain forward looking statements about the company that are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially as a result of any one or more of the risks identified in this section  as well as in the section captioned business factors 
overview yes entertainment corporation was founded in september to develop  manufacture and market a variety of toys and other children s entertainment products  including a variety of interactive products 
the company s strategy is to use innovative technology to design products that are fun for children and build on their natural creativity 
the company has achieved cumulative net sales of approximately million through december   although it had an accumulated deficit as of december  of approximately million 
management believes that delays in obtaining financing in and resulted in lost sales opportunities  including opportunities for reorders  and also required the company to incur higher than normal shipment and advertising expenses to expedite product delivery and create consumer demand in a shortened holiday selling period 
in  the company was able to secure financing to ensure that its products were introduced in time to take advantage of the holiday selling season 
in  the company s financial results were adversely affected by a number of issues  including a weak retail environment which caused retailers to defer orders and a delivery delay in the company s v link product  compounded in part by the voluntary suspension of v link shipments pending resolution of market approval issues from the fcc 
the production and shipment of the company s products is subject to a number of risks  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the development  tooling  manufacture or successful marketing of its products 
this risk is compounded by the large number of new products the company is introducing in  including many additions to the yes gear line of products such as yak maniak and several new power penz  the baskin robbins ice cream maker  air vectors and raw  each of which is still in the developmental stage and which also involve complicated development and tooling issues 
air vectors and raw are not expected to ship until late in the third quarter  and in the event there is a delay in the final development  tooling  production or transport of these products  they may not ship until even later in the year  if at all 
the company constantly evaluates the toy markets and its development and manufacturing schedules 
as the year progresses  the company may elect to reduce the number of products it currently plans on shipping in for a variety of reasons  which include but are not limited to more accurate evaluation of demand  supply and manufacturing difficulties  or competitive considerations 
similarly  the company may add products to its line either by accelerating development schedules or strategic acquisitions of current product lines 
reducing or adding products from and to the company s line may have an impact on the company s financial performance depending on  among other things  the price points  advertising and promotional support for and development  tooling and manufacturing costs of such products  relative to products they replace or are replaced by  as the case may be  if at all 
in  the company adopted a financial strategy to maintain a low break even point and to focus on profitability rather than sales growth 
management believes that this financial strategy was instrumental in achieving profitability in while the company attempted to maintain this strategy in  the revenue shortfall realized in was much more significant than the company had expected 
the company expects to continue to focus on controlling fixed expenses in  although there is no guarantee that a revenue shortfall in would not materially adversely affect the company s financial performance 
the company also expects to consider opportunities to enhance revenue growth as well as profitability through acquisitions or other strategic business relationships in results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from the company s statement of operations for the years ended december   and  and the relevant percentage of net sales represented by certain income and expense items years ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    operating expenses marketing  advertising promotion    selling  distribution administrative    total operating ex penses    operating income loss

products introduced in accounted for and of worldwide sales in and  respectively 
products introduced in accounted for of the company s worldwide sales in the company expects that newly introduced products will continue to account for a significant percentage of sales in the year they are introduced as the result both of expanding sales and the decline in sales of earlier products due to the relatively short life cycles of many products in the toy industry 
domestic net sales were million in  compared to million in and million in the slight increase in over was attributable to the introduction of a number of new product lines in  including the mrs 
fields baking factory and v link  together with the addition of a number of new products to the company s yes gear and power penz categories 
this increase was offset in part by lower than expected domestic sales in the fourth quarter of  and the decrease in unit sales and average selling price of the company s older product lines 
the increase in domestic net sales over was primarily the result of the introduction of yak bak and nickelodeon products in the company s yak bak and power penz product lines together accounted for a significant percentage of the company s sales in and  comprising and thereof  respectively 
yak bak accounted for of the company s net sales  the year in which yak bak was first shipped 
in and  the company s yak bak items accounted for approximately and of the company s sales  respectively 
the company s power penz products accounted for and of the company s sales in and  respectively  following the introduction of the power penz in in addition  in the company sold a number of yak bak and power penz products together  these sales accounted for approximately of the company s net sales 
no other product line accounted for more than of the company s sales in  although one product line  comes to life books  accounted for and of the company s sales in and  respectively 
although the company expects that its revenue base will be less concentrated on any one line of products in as compared to previous years  the company expects that yes gear  in particular the yak bak items  and the power penz and mrs 
fields lines of product will continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues in international net sales were million in compared with in and million in international sales were substantially higher in than due to the increased emphasis the company placed on expanding international sales in conjunction with the introduction of the company s yes gear line of product internationally beginning in sales to distributors in pacific rim countries comprised a substantial portion of the company s international sales  although the company expects that sales to europe will expand substantially in international net sales in were lower than in primarily as the result of weakness in the international economy 
international sales represented of worldwide sales in  and and of worldwide sales in and  respectively 
the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of product and computes net sales by concurrently deducting a provision for sales returns and allowances  including allowances for defective returns  price protection  mark downs and other returns 
sales allowances may vary as a percentage of gross sales due to changes in the company s product mix  defective product allowances or other sales allowances 
the company is dependent on a relatively small number of customers  in particular tru and wal mart  for a significant percentage of its sales 
significant reductions in sales to any one or more of the company s largest customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
because orders in the toy industry are generally cancelable at any time without penalty  there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their purchase agreements with the company or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of products ordered from the company 
any termination of a significant customer relationship or change  reduction or delay in significant orders would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company relies exclusively on foreign distributors to market and sell the company s products outside the united states 
although the company s international sales personnel work closely with its foreign distributors  the company cannot directly control such entities sales and marketing activities and  accordingly  cannot directly manage the company s product sales in foreign markets 
in addition  the company s international sales may be disrupted by currency fluctuations or other events beyond the company s control  including political or regulatory changes 
cost of sales cost of sales were approximately  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales in from was primarily the result of a substantial increase in the relative mix of international sales  which typically have lower associated gross margins  in compared to and an increase in returns and allowances and inventory provisions in as compared to the decline in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in from was primarily the result of favorable changes in product mix and was also due to an increase in inventory write downs and a relative increase in higher margin domestic sales 
in absolute dollars  cost of sales increased million from to and million from to as the result of higher overall sales and the factors enumerated above 
operating expenses years ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands marketing  advertising promo tion    selling  distribution admin istrative    total operating expenses    operating expenses increased by million in from operating expenses in decreased by million from the increase in was primarily the result of higher variable expenses associated with higher sales and higher fixed and marketing expenses required to support new product introductions and expected higher sales volume 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in  but were less than the for the increase in was primarily the result of a significant shortfall in expected net sales in the fourth quarter of the decrease in in operating expenses both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales as compared to was primarily the result of the company s strategy to maintain a low break even level 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are fixed and do not vary with sales 
consequently  if sales volumes fall below expectations  the company s financial results are likely to be materially adversely affected  particularly where  as in  this shortfall is not anticipated until late in the fourth quarter 
the company expects that fixed expenses will increase in marketing  advertising and promotion 
marketing  advertising and promotional expenses increased million in from to a total of million  to promote retail sales of the company s products at expected volumes that substantially exceeded actual sales in the fourth quarter 
in order to obtain the most competitive prices  advertising commitments  in particular for fourth quarter advertising  must be made in advance and cannot be canceled in the event of product shipment delays  as occurred with v link 
marketing  advertising and promotional expenses decreased million in from this decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in advertising expense  which was occasioned in part by the need for additional advertising in late to compensate for late delivery of product 
selling  distribution and administrative 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses increased million in from to a total of million  and increased as a percentage of sales to from for the comparable periods 
the increase in absolute dollars resulted from higher variable expenses associated with higher sales volume  higher royalty expenses associated with the increase in revenue  and higher costs in operations support  product development  and general and administrative expenses required to support expected higher sales volumes 
the increase as a percentage of sales was due to higher fixed expenses incurred in anticipation of greater sales volume in the fourth quarter of than occurred  offset in part by the company s ongoing efforts to maintain low fixed expenses 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses decreased million in from  and decreased as a percentage of net sales to in from in this decrease resulted from reduced headcount in operations support and product development and from significantly reduced spending in product development  operations support  administration  and sales activities 
interest expense the following table shows interest expense and interest income for the applicable periods years ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands interest income interest expense   interest expense decreased by  in from this decrease was primarily the result of decreased borrowing under the company s credit facility for working capital purposes  due in part to the higher cash balance the company maintained during the first half of interest expense increased by approximately  in from this increase was largely due to higher borrowings against the company s credit facilities as the result of increasing sales volume and purchase commitments 
the company expects interest expense to increase in due to increased reliance on borrowings under the company s credit facility and the issuance in march of convertible debentures in the aggregate principal amount of  as part of the march transaction  the company also issued  shares of convertible series a preferred stock 
this preferred stock has a cumulative semi annual dividend of per annum  which will not be accounted for as interest expense  and which may be paid either in common stock or cash  at the company s option 
other expense  net the decrease in other expense  net in and from was primarily the result of a charge against earnings taken in for unreconciled intercompany balances  offset in part by miscellaneous income 
the company has implemented procedures to ensure that future intercompany accounts are promptly cleared 
income taxes the company had no income tax provision for as the company had a pre tax loss of million 
the company s provision for income tax for of  represented an effective tax rate of five percent and  due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  was solely attributable to federal and state minimum taxes and foreign income taxes 
there was no provision for income taxes in as the company had a pre tax losses of million 
the company anticipates that its effective tax rate will increase in due  in part  to anticipated taxable income  offset in part by potential restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  discussed below 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and california tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal losses will expire in the years though  and the state losses will expire in the years through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating loss carryovers may be subject to a substantial annual limitation if it should be determined that there has been a change in the ownership of more than percent of the value of the company s stock  pursuant to section of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryovers before utilization 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality the company s business continues to be highly seasonal  with a majority of shipments to retailers occurring during the last five months of the year 
the company s operating results have varied significantly in the past  and are expected to vary in the future  from quarter to quarter 
the company expects that a majority of its product will ship in the third and fourth quarters  and a substantial portion of its accounts receivable will be collected in the fourth and first quarters 
the effect of seasonality  common in the toy industry  has been exaggerated in the company s case because of the introduction of the company s new product lines which represented a significant portion of the company s net sales in the third and fourth quarters of  and in  seasonality was compounded by the poor retail environment during the holiday season that caused retailers to not place reorders in the quantities expected 
the following table shows the net sales of the company for each of the past twelve quarters net sales by quarter years ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands march june september december total because of the highly seasonal nature of the company s business  the company may not be able to accurately predict retailer order trends  given that many retailers make final reorder decisions in the fourth quarter  and often after the date by which the company must make manufacturing commitments to build inventory in anticipation of retailer demand 
this accounted for the percentage decrease in fourth quarter shipments in from in addition  most of the company s most significant customers have adopted inventory management systems to track sales of particular products and rely on reorders being filled rapidly by suppliers  rather than maintaining large on hand inventories to meet consumer demand 
while these systems reduce a retailer s investment in inventory  they increase pressure on suppliers like the company to fill orders promptly and shift a significant portion of inventory risk to the supplier 
the company may also be required to incur substantial additional expense to fill late reorders in order to ensure the product is available at retail prior to christmas  these may include drop shipment expense and higher advertising allowances which would otherwise be born by the company s customers 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  a decrease of from approximately million at december  this decrease was attributable primarily to the company s net loss  net of depreciation and amortization  of million  cash used in other operating activities of million  the acquisition of property and equipment primarily tooling of approximately million  and the repayment of notes in the principal amount of million  offset in part by the proceeds primarily from issuance of common stock upon the exercise of warrants in january  net of costs  of million  proceeds from the collection of shareholder notes of  and net proceeds from bank loans of million 
since its inception  the company s internally generated cash flow has not been sufficient to finance trade receivables  inventory  capital equipment requirements and new product development  or to support operations 
the company has met its capital requirements to date primarily through the initial public offering of the company  which generated net proceeds to the company of approximately million  the exercise of ipo warrants which generated approximately million  the private sales of approximately million of equity securities  borrowings of million of long term convertible subordinated notes now repaid  borrowings under short term loans from certain stockholders  borrowings under bank loans guaranteed by certain shareholders  borrowings under a factoring agreement with a group of banks  borrowings under a loan and security agreement with congress financial corporation western  and borrowings under an accounts receivable management and security agreement entered into with bny financial corporation in july  as amended the arm agreement 
in addition  in the first quarter of  the company raised net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of convertible debentures  preferred stock and warrants 
to meet seasonal working capital requirements during the balance of  the company anticipates borrowing substantial amounts under the arm agreement 
the terms of the arm agreement  as amended  provide that bny financial corporation may advance yes up to million on the basis of the company s accounts receivable  inventory and product being imported on a letter of credit basis 
loans to the company are fully secured by all of the company s assets  including intellectual property  and bny acquired ownership of all of the company s trade receivables 
the company is required to remain in compliance with certain financial and other covenants under the arm agreement 
the company was not in compliance with the quick ratio and profitability covenants at december   but has obtained a waiver from bny with regard to those covenants 
the arm agreement also restricts the ability of the company to obtain working capital in the form of indebtedness  other than indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of the company s business  to grant security interests in the assets of the company or to pay dividends on the company s securities 
as of december   the company had borrowings of million under the arm agreement 
the company s working capital needs will depend upon numerous factors  including the extent and timing of acceptance of the company s products in the market  the company s operating results  the cost of increasing the company s sales and marketing activities and the status of competitive products  none of which can be predicted with certainty 
the company has experienced severe working capital shortfalls in the past  which have restricted the company s ability to conduct its business as anticipated 
as a result of seasonality in the toy industry  the timing of new product introductions and the company s planned growth  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional funding 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms  if at all  when required by the company 
the inability to obtain such financing would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
business factors because of the variety and uncertainty of the factors affecting the company s operating results  past financial performance and historic trends may not be a reliable indicator of future performance 
these factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating performance  and the fact that the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  may result in significant volatility in the company s common stock price 
the company s business is subject to a number of risks and the company s forward looking statements should be considered in light of the business factors set forth below 
limited operating history  history of losses  accumulated deficit 
the company has a short operating history  having commenced operation in november and shipped its first product in july although the company has achieved approximately million in cumulative net sales through december   the company incurred substantial operating losses in and  and again in  and at december  had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
future profitability is dependent upon the company s ability to successfully and timely introduce  finance and manufacture its new products  successfully market its existing products and collect trade receivables in a timely manner 
dependence on products 
in  the company has introduced and expects to commence sales of a number of new product lines in new product categories  such as the baskin robbins ice cream maker  air vectors  yes extreme  yes games  and yes preschool 
in addition  the company also expects to expand its existing product lines in  particularly its yes gear and power penz line of products 
manufacturing of certain of these items in commercial quantities has not commenced or is just commencing 
the company expects that completing the development and the manufacture of its product lines will place great demands on management and other company resources 
if the company is not able to complete the development  tooling  manufacture and successful marketing of its product lines  the company s operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on yes gear and power penz 
the majority of the company s current product lines are sold under the yes gear and power penz brands  which together accounted for and of the company s sales in and  respectively 
the company expects yes gear  and in particular the yak bak  and the power penz product lines to continue to account for a substantial percentage of the company s business 
in addition  the company is aware that a number of toy manufacturers have attempted to duplicate the company s success in this area of product by introducing similar lines of products in and for while the company believes it will compete favorably with these new products on the basis of styling  quality  product depth and promotional support  there can be no assurance that the sale of these competitive products will not impact the sale of the yes gear or power penz product lines  particularly on the basis of price 
just in time inventory  compressed sales cycles 
most of the company s most significant customers have adopted inventory management systems to track sales of particular products and rely on reorders being filled rapidly by suppliers  rather than maintaining large on hand inventories to meet consumer demand 
while these systems reduce a retailer s investment in inventory  they increase pressure on suppliers like the company to fill orders promptly and shift a significant portion of inventory risk to the supplier 
the limited inventory carried by the company s customers may also reduce or delay consumer sell through which in turn could impair the company s ability to obtain reorders of its product in quantities necessary to permit the company to achieve planned sales and income growth 
in addition  the company may be required to incur substantial additional expense to fill late reorders in order to ensure the product is available at retail prior to christmas  these may include drop shipment expense and higher advertising allowances which would otherwise be born by the company s customers 
in the event that anticipated reorders do not materialize  the company may incur increased inventory carrying costs 
changes in product line 
the company constantly evaluates the toy markets and its development and manufacturing schedules 
as the year progresses  the company may elect to reduce the number of products it currently plans on shipping in for a variety of reasons  which include but are not limited to more accurate evaluation of demand  supply and manufacturing difficulties  or competitive considerations 
similarly  the company may add products to its line either by accelerating development schedules or strategic acquisitions of current product lines 
reducing or adding products from and to the company s line may have an impact on the company s financial performance depending on  among other things  the price points  advertising and promotional support for and development  tooling and manufacturing costs of such products  relative to products they replace or are replaced by  as the case may be  if at all 
sales concentration risk 
the company s ten largest customers accounted for approximately  and of sales for the years ending december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the company s two largest customers  tru and wal mart  accounted for and of net sales  respectively 
for the year ended december   the same two customers each accounted for approximately of net sales and for the year ended december   tru and wal mart accounted for and of net sales  respectively 
while the company intends to expand distribution to new accounts  the company expects to continue to depend on a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of its sales 
significant reductions in sales to any one or more of the company s largest customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
because orders in the toy industry are generally cancelable at any time without penalty  there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their purchase arrangements with the company or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of products ordered from the company 
any such termination of a significant customer relationship or change  reduction or delay in significant orders could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
price protection  stock balancing  reliance of timely payment 
in connection with the introduction of new products  many companies in the toy industry discount prices of existing products  provide for certain advertising allowances and credits or give other sales incentives to their customers  particularly their most significant customers 
in addition  in order to address working capital requirements  sales of inventory  changes in marketing trends and other issues  many companies in the toy industry allow retailers to return slow moving products for credit  or if the manufacturer lowers the prices of its products  to provide price adjustments for inventories on hand at the time the price change occurs 
the company has made such accommodations in the past  and expects to make accommodations such as stock balancing  returns  other allowances or price protection adjustments in the future 
any such accommodations by the company in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in addition  in the past certain of the company s retail customers have delayed payment beyond the date such payment is due 
delays in payments from retail customers in the future could materially impact the company s anticipated cash flow to the detriment of the company s business 
short product cycles 
consumer preferences in the toy industry are continuously changing and are difficult to predict 
few products achieve market acceptance  and even when they do achieve commercial success  products typically have short life cycles 
there can be no assurance that i new products introduced by the company will achieve any significant degree of market acceptance  ii acceptance  if achieved  will be sustained for any significant amount of time  or iii such products life cycles will be sufficient to permit the company to recover development  manufacturing  marketing and other costs associated therewith 
in addition  sales of the company s existing product lines are expected to decline over time  and may decline faster than expected unless existing products are enhanced or new product lines are introduced 
failure of new product lines to achieve or sustain market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
international business risk 
the company will rely in principally on foreign distributors to market and sell the company s products outside the united states 
although the company s international sales personnel work closely with its foreign distributors  the company cannot directly control such entities sales and marketing activities and  accordingly  cannot directly manage the company s product sales in foreign markets 
in addition  the company s international sales may be disrupted by currency fluctuations or other events beyond the company s control  including political or regulatory changes 
dependence on manufacturing facilities based in people s republic of china 
the company contracts for the manufacture of substantially all of its products with entities based in hong kong whose manufacturing facilities are located in the people s republic of china 
in  hong kong will become a sovereign territory of the people s republic of china 
while the people s republic of china has provided assurances that hong kong will be allowed to maintain critical economic and tax policies  there can be no assurance that political or social tensions will not develop in hong kong that would disrupt this process 
in addition  recent tensions between the peoples republic of china and the republic of china taiwan  and the united states involvement therein  could result either in a disruption in manufacturing in the china mainland or in the imposition of tariffs or duties on chinese manufactured goods 
either event would have an adverse impact on the company s ability to obtain its products or on the cost of these products  respectively  such that its operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on restrictive facility 
the company is dependent on the arm agreement with bny financial corporation to meet its financial needs during  due in large part to the seasonality of the company s business whereby the company is required to finance the manufacture of a substantial portion of its products in the summer and autumn but does not collect on the sale of these products until the fourth quarter of that year and the first quarter of the following year 
under the terms of the arm agreement  bny financial corporation has taken a first priority security interest in substantially all of the company s assets  including its intellectual property 
the arm agreement also contains a number of restrictive covenants  including covenants concerning the requirement that donald kingsborough and sol kershner  the company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer  respectively  remain active in the management of the company 
in the event the company falls out of compliance with the arm agreement  and bny financial corporation does not provide financing  the company would not be able to finance its operations as contemplated  and its operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected
