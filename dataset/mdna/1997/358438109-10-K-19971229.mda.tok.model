cash used in operations was the result of the growth in accounts receivable and inventories  both principally from the net addition of stores in fiscal  stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal cash used in operations was also affected by increases in accounts payable in each of the three years  respectively 
to the extent that the company continues to expand rapidly  it will continue to experience significant increases in credit sales and related increases in customer accounts as well as increases in inventories and accounts payable which will likely result in a use of cash from operations

during fiscal  the company invested million in crescent jewelers inc  and its wholly owned subsidiary crescent jewelers together crescent  a privately owned west coast based specialty retailer of fine jewelry currently operating stores

during fiscal  the company advanced million in accordance with the agreement 
on july   the company completed a new million  two year revolving credit facility maturing on april   with its existing banks and includes the addition of a third institution 
the borrowing rate for the new credit facility is either the bank s offered rate plus or at the company s option  libor plus 
the new facility contains certain financial covenants and is secured by inventory and accounts receivable 
at september   million was outstanding under the lines  with interest payable ranging from to 
management believes that the company s line of credit will be sufficient to fund the company s working capital requirements through fiscal the company expects to have between and stores in operation for the christmas season 
the capital required to fund this expansion  principally to finance inventory  fixtures and leasehold improvements  is estimated to be between million and million and is intended to be provided by the company s line of credit 
seasonality the company has in the past experienced a well defined seasonality in its business with respect to both total revenues and profitability 
generally  the company experiences substantially increased sales volume in the days preceding major holidays  including christmas  valentine s day and mother s day 
due to the impact of the christmas shopping season  the company experiences the strongest results of operations in the first quarter of its fiscal year 
if for any reason the company s sales were below those normally expected for the first quarter  the company s annual results could be materially adversely affected 
the seasonality of the company s business puts a significant demand on working capital resources to provide for an inventory buildup for the christmas season 
furthermore  the christmas season typically leads to a seasonal buildup of customer receivables that are paid down during subsequent months 
however  to the extent that the company s expansion program continues  it can be expected that increased levels of accounts receivable related to such expansion may affect the historical seasonal decline in customer receivables 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy and relative stability in the prices of diamonds  gemstones and gold 
substantially all of the leases for the company s retail stores located in malls provide for contingent or volume related rental increases 
in prior years  the company has been able to adjust its selling prices to substantially recover increased costs 
while inflation has not had  and the company does not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
new accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share eps sfas no 
 which simplifies the calculation of eps by excluding common stock equivalents from the calculation of basic eps 
the new eps rules are effective for both interim and annual periods ending after december  the company will adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of as early adoption is not permitted 
management does not expect the impact of adopting sfas no 
to be material 
factors affecting future performance expansion program 
the success of the company s growth strategy will depend on its ability to expand its operations through the opening of new stores in existing and new markets and to operate these stores on a profitable basis 
the company opened approximately stores from december through december and intends to continue to expand its store base rapidly 
accomplishing the company s expansion goals will depend on a number of factors  including general economic conditions and the company s ability to identify and secure suitable locations on acceptable terms  open new stores in a timely manner  hire and train additional store personnel and integrate new stores into its operations 
the company anticipates that there will be significant competition among specialty retailers for desirable store sites 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely and profitable basis 
if the company expands more rapidly than its current plans anticipate or if the company fails to generate sufficient cash flow  the company may require additional capital in order to finance such expansion 
the company is also likely to require additional capital to finance its expansion after furthermore  the company will need to continually evaluate the adequacy of its management information and distribution systems to manage its planned expansion 
there can be no assurance that the company will anticipate all of the changing demands that its expanding operations will impose on such systems and the failure to adapt its systems and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  as the company enters new markets or expands its presence in certain markets  the company may experience initial uncertainty in its credit portfolio as the company evaluates the credit characteristics of the new customer base

competition 
the retail jewelry business is highly competitive 
the company competes with national and regional jewelry chains  department stores  kiosks  local independently owned jewelry stores and chains  catalog showrooms  discounters  direct mail suppliers and televised home shopping networks  credit card companies and other providers of consumer credit 
certain of the company s competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
the company also believes that it competes for consumers discretionary spending dollars with retailers that offer merchandise other than fine jewelry 
the foregoing competitive conditions may adversely affect the company s revenues  profitability and ability to expand 
see business competition 
sensitivity to general economic conditions 
jewelry purchases are discretionary for customers 
as a result  sales of merchandise such as that offered by the company are likely to be particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy 
sales of jewelry products may also be affected adversely by negative developments in local economic conditions such as plant closings  industry slowdown and government employment cutbacks 
in addition  because a majority of the company s sales are made on credit  any downturn in general economic conditions or increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
furthermore  the company expects that any downturn in general or local economic conditions in the markets in which it operates would adversely affect its collection of outstanding credit accounts receivable 
the company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience 
at september   the company s allowance for uncollectible accounts was of accounts receivable  and net charge offs as a percentage of credit revenues increased to for fiscal from for fiscal see selected financial and operating data and business credit operations 
seasonality 
the company s business is highly seasonal 
historically  the company s first fiscal quarter ending december has accounted for significant percentages of the company s annual net sales and net income 
any substantial decrease in first fiscal quarter sales could have a material adverse effect on the company s profitability for the entirety of such fiscal year 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is substantially dependent on the continued services of its executive officers  including bradley j 
stinn  chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer  and robert s 
morris  president and chief operating officer 
mr 
stinn is also chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of crescent jewelers inc crescent jewelers  a retail jewelry chain which is an affiliate of the company 
should mr 
stinn  mr 
morris or any of the company s other executive officers not continue as an officer of the company  the company s prospects might be adversely affected 
the company does not have and is not contemplating obtaining key man life insurance for any executive officer of the company 
incentive compensation program 
in october  when the price of the class a common stock was approximately per share  mr 
stinn and sterling b 
brinkley  chairman of the executive committee of the board of directors  were each advanced million  the repayment of which will be forgiven upon the attainment of specific targets for the price of the company s class a common stock 
upon forgiveness of principal and interest  the company will incur compensation expense as of the date of the respective forgiveness 
the first stock price target per share was attained in july and compensation expense totaling  which represents forgiveness of principal and related income tax costs  was charged to operations during that period 
the second stock price target per share and the third stock price target per share were attained in april and may  respectively  and compensation expense totaling million was charged to operations in the quarter ending june  if additional stock price targets are achieved  the company will incur up to an additional million of compensation expense as a result of the forgiveness of these advances 
the incurrence of such amounts of compensation expense will negatively impact the earnings per share of the class a common stock 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in comparable store sales results 
a variety of factors affect the company s comparable store sales results including  among others  economic conditions  the retail sales environment and the company s ability to execute its business strategy efficiently 
the company experienced a decrease in comparable store sales in fiscal the company expects comparable store sales to be flat to slightly lower in the future and there can be no assurance that the company will achieve comparable store sales gains in any period 
variations in the company s comparable store sales results could cause the price of the class a common stock to fluctuate substantially 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
merchandise supply 
the company does not manufacture its own merchandise 
the jewelry industry generally is affected by fluctuations in the prices of gold and diamonds and  to a lesser extent  other precious and semi precious metals and stones 
the company does not maintain long term inventories or otherwise hedge against fluctuations in the cost of diamonds or gold 
a significant increase in prices or decrease in the availability of gold or diamonds could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the supply and price of diamonds in the principal world markets are significantly influenced by a single entity  the central selling organization the cso  a marketing arm of debeers consolidated mines ltd 
of south africa 
the cso has traditionally controlled the marketing of a substantial majority of the world s supply of diamonds and sells rough diamonds to worldwide diamond cutters from its london office in quantities and at prices determined in its sole discretion 
the availability of diamonds to the cso and the company s suppliers is to some extent dependent on the political situation in diamond producing countries  such as south africa  botswana  zaire  the russian republics and australia  and on the continuation of the prevailing supply and marketing arrangements for raw diamonds 
until alternate sources could be developed  any sustained interruption in the supply of diamonds from the producing countries could adversely affect the company and the retail jewelry industry as a whole

the partnership owns of the class b common stock of the company 
through ms jewelers  mr 
cohen alone controls virtually all of the decisions made with respect to the partnership  including the disposition and voting of the class b common stock held by the partnership 
as a result of his control of the class b common stock  mr 
cohen can  without the concurrence of the remaining stockholders of the company  elect of the directors of the company and control the outcome of votes by the company s stockholders on major corporate transactions  including mergers  sales of substantial assets and going private transactions 
mr 
cohen could also  subject to certain limitations  unilaterally transfer such voting power to a third party by transferring such shares of class b common stock or the stock of ms jewelers 
there also is no prohibition or limitation on mr 
cohen s ownership of class a common stock 
if all of the outstanding shares of class b common stock were converted into shares of class a common stock  the partnership would own approximately of the class a common stock 
mr

limited voting rights of class a common stock 
holders of the class a common stock  voting as a class  have the right to elect a minimum of of the company s board of directors rounding the number of directors to the next highest whole number if the application of such percentage does not result in a whole number  currently two of six 
other than the right to elect directors  unless all of the shares of class b common stock are converted into class a common stock and except as may be required by the laws of the state of delaware  holders of class a common stock have no voting rights 
the partnership owns of the outstanding shares of the company s class b common stock 
consequently  the partnership controls the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders 
the disproportionate voting rights between the class a common stock and the class b common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of the class a common stock 
such disproportionate voting rights may make the company a less attractive target for a takeover than it otherwise might be  or render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal  a tender offer or a proxy contest  even if such actions were favored by holders of the company s class a common stock 
such disproportionate voting rights may also deprive holders of class a common stock of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over then prevailing market prices for the class a common stock 
in addition  holders of class b common stock may be able to transfer voting control to a third party at a premium without obtaining such premium for holders of class a common stock 
government regulation 
the extension of credit by the company  as well as its sale of insurance products  is highly regulated by federal and state authorities 
a failure on the part of the company to comply with such regulations would expose it to potentially substantial penalties 
in addition  any restrictive change in such regulation  including the imposition of interest rate ceilings or restrictions on the sale of insurance products by the company  could have a material adverse effect on the company
