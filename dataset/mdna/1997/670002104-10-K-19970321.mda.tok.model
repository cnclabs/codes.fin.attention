results of operations the company has incurred net losses since its inception from the development of its technologies to human pharmaceuticals  vaccines and vaccine adjuvants 
novavax expects the losses to increase in the near term  as it conducts additional human clinical trials and seeks regulatory approval for its product candidates 
the company also expects to continue to incur substantial operating losses over the extensive time period required to develop the company s products  or until such time as revenues  to offset the losses  are sufficient to fund its continuing operations 
until the second quarter of  the company had recorded revenues from two sources i research revenues from industry partners in consideration of either exclusive licenses or technology application reviews and ii royalty revenues that were attributable to product sales by igi 
revenues from the sale of scientific prototype vaccines and adjuvants have been recorded in the second  third and fourth quarters of compared to the net loss of  for the year ended december  was  or  lower than the net loss of  for the year ended december  the net loss includes  compared to  included in the net loss  of non cash compensation expense

revenues of  were recognized during the year ended december  from the sale of scientific prototype vaccines and adjuvants 
novavax earned royalties from igi of of licensed product sales  or  in the year ended december  total operating expenses were  in  decreasing  or  from the  incurred in reduced cash resources have caused the company to reduce spending  achieve other efficiencies and have caused the company to focus its efforts on the development of its three lead product candidates in connection with fda human clinical trials 
selling  general and administrative expenses include all costs associated with the marketing of the company s technology to potential industry partners  related cost associated with management and adminis trative expenses 
costs associated with the distribution are included in the expenses

nonrecurring charges of  were incurred through june  for transitional services provided by igi 
the agreement providing for these services terminated on june  and no additional charges have been recorded

the form was structured as a prepaid license agreement to address various considerations of the distribution  including tax and financing considerations 
for tax purposes  the transaction was treated as income for the period ended december  novavax has recorded the license at its carryover basis because the transaction is a transfer made among entities under common control 
as all costs of development for this technology have been expensed  with the exception of the patents retained by novavax  the historical basis is zero 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources novavax s future growth will depend on its ability to commercialize its novavax technologies for human pharmaceutical applications 
novavax s capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to the progress of its research and development programs  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and changes in novavax s development of commercialization activities and arrangements 
the company s rapid evolution from a research phase company to a development stage biopharmaceutical company with products in human clinical trials prompted the need for expansion during on october   the company completed the relocation of its administrative offices and pharmaceutical laboratories to a leased facility in columbia  maryland 
further expansion necessary to establish commercial scale manufacturing capabilities and the future purchases of capital equipment are subject to the company s ability to raise funds through additional equity financing  or collaborative arrangements with corporate partners

past spending levels are not necessarily indicative of future spending 
future expenditures for product development  especially relating to outside testing and human clinical trials  are discretionary and  accordingly  can be adjusted to available cash 
moreover  the company will seek to establish one or more collaborations with industry partners to defray the costs of clinical trials and other related activities 
novavax will also seek to obtain additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional funding or bank financing will be available at all or on acceptable terms to permit successful commercialization of novavax s technologies and products 
if adequate funds are not available  novavax may be required to significantly delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of its research or development programs  or seek alternative measures including arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require novavax to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates or products
