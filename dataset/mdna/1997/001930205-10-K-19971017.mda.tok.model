forward looking statements certain statements contained in the management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are forward looking statements 
several important factors can cause actual results to materially differ from those stated or implied in the forward looking statements 
such factors include  but are not limited to the growth rate of the company s selected market segments  the positioning of the company s products in those segments  variations in demand for and cost of customer services and technical support  customer adoption of internet enabled windows r applications and their willingness to upgrade from dos versions of software  the company s ability to release new software applications and upgrades on a timely basis  the company s ability to establish and maintain strategic alliances  the company s ability to manage its costs  the company s ability to manage its business in a rapidly changing environment  the company s ability to finance capital investments  and the company s ability to implement its acquisition strategy to increase growth 
projected revenues are difficult to estimate because the company s revenues and operating results may vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
the primary cause of the variation is attributed to non recurring revenues from software license and customization fees 
license fee revenues are based on contracts signed and product delivered 
non recurring revenues are affected by the time required to close large license fee and development agreements  which cannot be predicted with any certainty due to customer requirements and decision making processes 
recurring revenues are also difficult to estimate 
recurring revenues from maintenance and subscription fees may be estimated based on the number of subscribers to the company s services but will be affected by the renewal ratio  which cannot be determined in advance 
recurring revenues from network traffic fees and transaction fees are difficult to estimate as they are determined by usage 
usage is a function of the number of subscribers and the number of transactions per subscriber 
transactions include product ordering  warranty claim processing  inventory and sales reporting  parts number updates and price updates 
the company cannot materially affect or predict the volume of transactions per customer 
although the company has recently introduced and plans to expand its internet enabled windows r portfolio of products  the marketplace is highly competitive and there can be no assurance that a customer will select the company s software and services over that of a competitor 
the environment in which the company competes is characterized by rapid technological changes  dynamic customer demands  and frequent product enhancements and product introductions 
some of the company s current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and advertising resources than the company 
the widespread acceptance of the internet may increase the usage of the company s product applications and may change the manner in which the company charges for its services
