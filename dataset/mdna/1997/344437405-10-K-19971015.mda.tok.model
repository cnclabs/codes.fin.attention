item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
introduction 
the company was formed in to engage in the business of designing  manufacturing and selling mri scanners 
in  the company formed a wholly owned subsidiary  us health management corporation hmc in order to expand into the physician practice management business 
in connection with its entry into this new line of business  hmc completed two acquisitions 
the first acquisition was of a group of companies engaged in the business of managing three diagnostic imaging centers and one multi specialty practice in new york state the affordable companies 
the second acquisition was of raymond v 
damadian  md mr scanning centers management company rvdc  a company owned by fonar s principal stockholder  president and chairman of the board  raymond v 
damadian 
the business of rvdc  to be continued by hmc  was the management of mri diagnostic imaging centers in new york  florida  georgia and other locations 
fonar s principal mri products are its quad and quad mri scanners 
having received the necessary fda approvals for its quad scanners  the company believes it is in a position to aggressively seek new sales 
the quad scanners are highly competitive and totally new non claustrophobic scanners not previously available in the mri market 
at 
tesla field strength  the quad magnet is the highest field open mri in the industry  offering non claustrophobic mri together with high field image quality for the first time 
the company expects vigorous sales from its new products 
as part of its scanner marketing program  the company attended the industry s annual trade show  rsna radiological society of north america in november and  and plans to do so again in november the company believes that it is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the rapidly expanding open mri market  as the manufacturer of the only high field open mri in the industry 
the company expects marked demand for this product since image quality increases as a direct proportion to magnetic field strength 
in addition  the company s new scanners provide improved image quality and high speed imaging at costs that are significantly less than the competition and more in keeping with the medical cost reduction demands being made by our national leaders on behalf of the public 
as at september   the company s backlog of unfilled orders was approximately million  as compared to approximately million at september  hmc generates revenues from providing comprehensive management services including development  administration  accounting and billing and collection services together with office space  medical equipment  supplies and non medical personnel to its clients 
revenues are in the form of management and leasing fees 
hmc did not actively engage in business until after june   which was the effective date of its acquisitions of the affordable companies and rvdc 
as separate businesses  the affordable companies had been engaged in business since and rvdc had been engaged in business since for financial statement presentation the results of operations  assets and liabilities of the company and rvdc have been consolidated for prior periods 
the affordable companies have been consolidated for balance sheet purposes  but not for results of operations for prior periods 
in connection with the acquisition of the affordable companies and related transactions  the company has issued  shares of its common stock and will release from escrow an additional  shares provided certain financial performance goals are met 
the acquisition of rvdc was consummated by the purchase of all of the outstanding shares of rvdc for  shares of the company s common stock 
the company s efforts to reduce infringement of its intellectual property rights by competitors have produced material benefits  as reflected in the million recovered from general electric company 
after deduction of attorney s fees  the net amount of million was collected by the company on july  the full amount of the award was recognized for financial statement purposes in fiscal see financial statements 
the company also has commenced and settled similar patent infringement suits against other major competitors see litigation 
results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal except where otherwise indicated  the results of operations reflect the consolidation of the company and rvdc  but not of the affordable companies 
in fiscal  the company experienced net income of million on revenues of million as compared to a net loss of million on revenues of million for fiscal revenues and income losses attributable to rvdc were approximately million and million respectively for fiscal and million and million respectively for fiscal as noted above  net income for fiscal reflects the net income attributable to the award received by the company in its patent litigation 
as the company has expanded its operations and productive capacity  costs and expenses increased in fiscal cost of revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal costs of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses attributable to rvdc were million and million respectively for fiscal and million and million  respectively for fiscal continuing its tradition as the originator of mri  the company remained committed to maintaining its position as the leading innovator of the industry through aggressive investing in research and development 
in fiscal the company continued its investment in the development of its new mri scanners  together with software and upgrades  with an investment of  in research and development  of which was capitalized as compared to   of which was capitalized in fiscal the research and development expenditure was approximately of revenues in and of revenues in the company has continued its efforts to increase scanner sales in foreign countries as well as domestically 
based on sales to date  further indications of interest  meetings  sales trips abroad and negotiations  the company is optimistic that foreign sales will continue to prove a significant source of revenue 
the company continued to benefit as a result of programs set in motion in fiscal  namely strict cost containment initiatives and expanding the corporate business into a greater number of profitable enterprises within and related to the mri and medical industries eg  physician practice management  customer service  upgrades 
as a result of this expansion  including the acquisition of rvdc  the percentage of the company s revenue derived from sources other than scanner sales was approximately for fiscal and for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  the company experienced a net loss of million on revenues of million as compared to a net loss of million on revenues of million for fiscal revenues and income losses attributable to rvdc were million and million  respectively for fiscal and million and million  respectively for fiscal lower revenues experienced in fiscal were the principal reason for the operating losses experienced in fiscal operating losses of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal 
lower revenues reflected strong competition in the markets for both mri products and diagnostic imaging services  and a continued weak domestic demand for mri scanners in a marketplace eager to see new products that would address both the heightened cost pressures on mri and the patient demand for non claustrophobic scanners 
as at september   the company s backlog of unfilled scanner orders was approximately million  as compared to million at september  as the company has expanded its operations and productive capacity to meet and anticipate new orders  costs and expenses increased in fiscal although cost of revenues remained relatively constant at approximately million in as compared to million in fiscal  research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal costs of revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses attributable to rvdc were million and million respectively for fiscal and million and million for fiscal in fiscal the company invested  in research and development  of which was capitalized as compared to  in research and development  of which was capitalized in fiscal the research and development expenditure was approximately of revenues in and of revenues in liquidity and capital resources at june   the company s liquidity and capital resources positions changed from the june  position as follows june  june  change working capital deficiency    the improvement in the company s working capital position resulted primarily from the award in its patent litigation million  but cash and accounts receivable increased from fiscal to fiscal as well to million at june  from million at june  
the increase in current liabilities from million to million at june  was attributable principally to dividends payable on the awards and settlements in the company s patent litigation  accrued compensation  taxes and legal fees 
since june  a principal objective of the company has been to reduce and ultimately eliminate its debt 
since the inception of the plan  interest bearing debt was reduced from million in fiscal which does not include any indebtedness of rvdc to million on a consolidated basis with rvdc at june  million without consolidating rvdc 
from june to june   interest bearing debt increased slightly  from million to million  reflecting principally the financing of new equipment in connection with the expansion of the company s productive capacity 
as of june   the company had no unused credit facilities with banks or financial institutions 
the company s business plan currently includes an aggressive program for manufacturing and selling its new line of quad scanners which are achieving success in the marketplace 
in addition the company plans  through its subsidiary  us health management corporation  to develop and expand its ppm physician practice management business see description of business 
the company believes its present financial resources are sufficient to achieve the sales  service and production levels necessary to support its operations 
the company offers its products for sale or lease to customers 
cash flows from leasing transactions are derived under the terms of the underlying agreements 
over the long term  the company expects enhanced cash flows and increased revenues from such transactions while in the short term  such transactions impair cash flow 
in order to mitigate the short term effect on cash flow  the company previously had borrowed money secured by the leases and the underlying equipment 
such debt comprises substantially all of the remaining long term debt in the accompanying financial statements 
in addition to leasing products to customers  the company has developed and begun to implement a new program to finance a portion of the purchase price of its scanners through a newly formed subsidiary  fonar acceptance corporation  and to assist the customer in obtaining the remaining portion of its financing through an independent source or sources 
the new program is intended to increase the overall profitability of the company by assisting in the sale of scanners and participating in the profits derived from financing those sales 
since the company has restructured various long term loans and notes 
the significant changes included extended maturity dates  and the addition of unpaid interest to the note and loan balances 
capital expenditures for each of fiscal and approximated million and million  respectively  and substantially consisted of capitalized computer software costs in connection with the development of scanner products  patent costs  copyright costs and production equipment 
the company s business plan initiated in september  had as its objective the enhancement and stabilization of revenue streams through the generation of additional income from its installed base of scanners and leasing programs 
in addition  the company instituted strict cost containment programs 
while continuing to focus on new sources of income  the company now has commenced aggressive sales and manufacturing of its new generation of open mri scanners  the quad scanners and is reemphasizing mri scanner sales 
in addition  the company is seeking to enhance revenue by entering into the ppm physician practice management business through its new subsidiary  us health management corporation hmc 
cost containment programs continue in force notwithstanding an increase in costs and expenses resulting from increased manufacturing activity and marketing of its mri scanners 
these programs  which include increasing the portion of manufacturing conducted on the company s premises  have enabled the company to achieve significantly lower manufacturing costs than would have otherwise been experienced in the production of its quad scanners 
this has enabled the company to pass on to customers a much needed reduction in the sales price of mri scanners 
the company s plan calls for a continuing emphasis on providing its customers with enhanced equipment service and maintenance capabilities and delivering state of the art  innovative and high quality equipment upgrades at competitive prices 
fees for on going service and maintenance from the company s installed base of scanners were million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  transactions between the company and rvdc are eliminated in the consolidation 
the company will continue to aggressively develop and market upgrades and enhancements for previously installed scanners 
the company s working capital surplus as of june  approximates million  as compared to a working capital deficiency of million as of june  the company believes that the above mentioned financial resources will provide the cash flows needed to achieve the sales  service and production levels necessary to support its operations 
in addition  the company is exploring other more permanent financing alternatives which may become available as the success of the previously described programs accelerates
