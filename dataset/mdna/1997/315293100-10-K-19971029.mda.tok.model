such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements 
the risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the following and their effect on the partnership s operations a the effect of weather conditions on demand for propane  b price and availability of propane supplies  c the availability of capacity to transport propane to market areas  d competition from other energy sources and within the propane industry  e operating risks incidental to transporting  storing  and distributing propane  f changes in interest rates g governmental legislation and regulations  h energy efficiency and technology trends and i other factors that are discussed in the partnership s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
general the partnership is engaged in the sale  distribution  marketing and trading of propane and other natural gas liquids 
the partnership s revenue is derived primarily from the retail propane marketing business 
the general partner believes the partnership is the second largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  based on gallons sold  serving more than  residential  industrial commercial and agricultural customers in states and the district of columbia through approximately retail outlets and satellite locations 
annual retail propane sales volumes were million  million  and million gallons for the fiscal years ended july    and  respectively 
the retail propane business of the partnership consists principally of transporting propane purchased in the contract and spot markets  primarily from major oil companies  to its retail distribution outlets and then to tanks located on the customers premises  as well as to portable propane cylinders 
in the residential and commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating and cooking 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for crop drying  space heating  irrigation and weed control 
in addition  propane is used for certain industrial applications  including use as an engine fuel  which is burned in internal combustion engines that power vehicles and forklifts and as a heating or energy source in manufacturing and drying processes 
the partnership is also engaged in the trading of propane and other natural gas liquids  chemical feedstocks marketing and wholesale propane marketing 
through its natural gas liquids trading operations and wholesale marketing  the partnership is one of the largest independent traders of propane and natural gas liquids in the united states 
in fiscal year  the partnership s wholesale and trading sales volume was approximately billion gallons of propane and other natural gas liquids  over of which was propane 
the partnership s traders are engaged in trading propane and other natural gas liquids for the partnership s account and for supplying the partnership s retail and wholesale propane operations 
the partnership primarily trades products purchased from its over suppliers  however  it also conducts transactions on the new york mercantile exchange 
trading activity is conducted primarily to generate a profit independent of the retail and wholesale operations  but is also conducted to insure the availability of propane during periods of short supply 
propane represents over of the partnership s total trading volume  with the remainder consisting principally of various other natural gas liquids 
the partnership attempts to minimize trading risk through the enforcement of its trading policies  which include total inventory limits and loss limits  and attempts to minimize credit risk through credit checks and application of its credit policies 
however  there can be no assurance that historical experience or the existence of such policies will prevent trading losses in the future 
for the partnership s fiscal years ended july   and  net revenues from trading activities were million  million and million  respectively 
selected quarterly financial data in thousands  except per unit data due to the seasonality of the retail propane business  first and fourth quarter revenues  gross profit and net earnings are consistently less than the comparable second and third quarter results 
other factors affecting the results of operations include competitive conditions  demand for product  variations in the weather and fluctuations in propane prices 
fiscal during the first three quarters of fiscal  the partnership experienced increased revenues and gross profit due to the affect of acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal and significantly higher wholesale propane product costs  partially offset by the impact of warmer weather 
the fourth quarter gross profit was negatively affected by a cumulative inventory costing adjustment that related to the prior three quarters 
this inventory costing adjustment contributed to approximately   and  as a percentage of revenues  of the partnership s gross profit increase in the first  second and third quarters of fiscal  respectively 
in addition  net earnings loss for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal were positively affected by favorable general liability claims experience 
the following presents the partnership s selected quarterly financial data for the two years ended july  fiscal year ended july  first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter revenues     gross profit     net earnings loss     net earnings loss per limited partner unit fiscal year ended july  first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter revenues     gross profit     earnings loss before extraordinary loss     earnings loss before extraordinary loss per limited partner unit net earnings loss     reflects a extraordinary loss on early retirement of debt  net of minority interest of results of operations fiscal year ended july  versus fiscal year ended july  total revenues 
total revenues increased to  as compared to  in the prior year  primarily due to increased sales price per retail gallon  increased retail propane volumes  and to a lesser extent an increase in revenues from other operations net trading operations  wholesale propane marketing and chemical feedstocks marketing 
a volatile propane market during the first half of fiscal caused a significant increase in the cost of product which in turn caused an increase in sales price per gallon 
retail volumes increased by or million gallons  primarily due to the increase in volumes related to acquisitions partially offset by the affect of warmer weather during fiscal as compared to fiscal and by customer conservation efforts 
fiscal winter temperatures  as reported by the american gas association  were warmer than the prior year and warmer than normal 
the increase in revenues from other operations to  is due to an increase in wholesale marketing volumes and sales price per gallon  partially offset by a decrease in chemical feedstocks marketing revenues 
wholesale marketing volumes increased primarily due to the effect of acquisitions while price increased as a result of increased cost of product 
chemical feedstocks volumes decreased as a result of decreased availability of product from refineries and decreased demand from petrochemical companies 
unrealized gains and losses on options  forwards  and futures contracts were not significant at july  and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to  as compared to  in the fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in retail sales gross margin  partially offset by a decrease in gross profits from other operations 
retail operations results increased primarily due to the increase in volumes attributed to acquisitions and an increase in retail margins  partially offset by the effect of warmer weather and customer conservation efforts 
wholesale marketing and chemical feedstocks is comprised of low margin sales  therefore  the net increase in revenues did not significantly affect gross profit 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to  as compared to  in the prior year primarily due to acquisition related increases in personnel costs  plant and office expenses  and vehicle and other expenses  partially offset by favorable general liability claims experience 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  as compared to  for the prior year due primarily to acquisitions of propane businesses 
interest expense 
interest expense increased over the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of the mlp s issuance of  of senior secured notes in april  the mlp senior notes the proceeds of which were primarily used to fund acquisitions made in fiscal  partially offset by an overall decrease in interest rates on borrowings during the year 
fiscal year ended july  versus fiscal year ended july  total revenues 
total revenues increased as compared to the prior year  primarily due to increased retail propane volumes and increased sales price per retail gallon  partially offset by the decline in revenues from other operations net trading operations  wholesale propane marketing and chemical feedstocks marketing 
retail volumes increased by or million gallons  primarily due to the affect of colder weather during fiscal as compared to fiscal and acquisition related growth 
fiscal winter temperatures  as reported by the american gas association  were colder than the prior year and colder than normal 
colder winter temperatures also caused higher cost of product which in turn produced a corresponding increase in sales price per gallon as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in revenues from other operations to  is primarily due to a decrease in chemical feedstocks marketing revenues due to a decrease in sales volume and selling price 
both volume and price decreased as a result of decreased availability of product from refineries and decreased demand from petrochemical companies 
unrealized gains and losses on options  forwards  and futures contracts were not significant at july  and  respectively 
the acquisition of skelgas in may did not have a significant affect on fiscal revenues due to the expected low retail volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal the partnership expects fiscal retail propane revenues to increase primarily due to the full fiscal year impact of the skelgas acquisition 
due to  among other factors  the uncertainty in both fiscal temperature levels and sales price per gallon  the partnership is unable to predict the impact of the skelgas acquisition on future revenues 
during the nine months ended april   skelgas sold approximately million retail propane gallons  however  temperatures were colder than normal 
gross profit 
gross profit increased as compared to the fiscal year  primarily due to a  increase in retail sales gross margin and to a lesser extent gross profits from other operations 
retail operations results increased primarily due to the increase in retail volumes 
other operations increased  mainly due to the increased activity of a non retail transportation operation 
this increased activity did not materially impact income from continuing operations due to the related increase in operating expenses 
chemical feedstocks is comprised of low margin sales  therefore  the decrease in revenues did not significantly impact gross profit 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased over the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to acquisitions of propane and increased activity in the non retail transportation operations as compared to the prior year 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased over the prior year due primarily to acquisitions of propane businesses 
interest expense and extraordinary loss 
interest expense increased over the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of the mlp s issuance the mlp senior notes  the increased net borrowings from the operating partnership s revolving credit loans during the first nine months of the year  partially offset by decreasing interest rates during the first nine months of the year 
the extraordinary charge of  is due to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs as a result of the refinancing of the  of floating rate debt previously issued by the operating partnership 
liquidity and capital resources the ability of the mlp to satisfy its obligations is dependent upon future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business and weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
for the fiscal year ending july   the general partner believes that the olp will have sufficient funds to meet its obligations and enable it to distribute to the mlp sufficient funds to permit the mlp to meet its obligations with respect to the mlp senior notes issued in april  and enable it to distribute the minimum quarterly distribution per unit on all common units and subordinated units 
future maintenance and working capital needs of the partnership are expected to be provided by cash generated from future operations  existing cash balances and the working capital borrowing facility 
in order to fund expansive capital projects and future acquisitions  the olp may borrow on existing bank lines  the mlp or olp may issue additional debt or the mlp may issue additional common units 
toward this purpose the mlp maintains a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for  common units representing limited partner interests in the mlp 
the common units may be issued from time to time by the mlp in connection with the olp s acquisition of other businesses  properties or securities in business combination transactions 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended july   compared to  in the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable related to timing of trading activity at year end and increased earnings prior to non cash deductions 
investing activities 
the partnership made total acquisition capital expenditures of  including working capital acquired of  during fiscal this amount was funded by  cash payments including  for transition costs previously accrued for fiscal acquisitions and  in other costs and consideration 
during the year ended july   the partnership made growth and maintenance capital expenditures of  primarily for the following purposes additions to partnership owned customer tanks and cylinders  vehicle lease buyouts  relocating the houston office and relocating and upgrading district plant facilities  and development of an enhanced gas inventory management system and upgrading computer equipment and software 
capital requirements for repair and maintenance of property  plant and equipment are relatively low since technological change is limited and the useful lives of propane tanks and cylinders  the partnership s principal physical assets  are generally long 
the partnership maintains its vehicle and transportation equipment fleet by leasing light and medium duty trucks and tractors 
the general partner believes vehicle leasing is a cost effective method for meeting the partnership s transportation equipment needs 
the partnership continues to seek expansion of its operations through strategic acquisitions of smaller retail propane operations located throughout the united states 
these acquisitions will be funded through internal cash flow  external borrowings or the issuance of additional partnership interests 
the partnership does not have any material commitments of funds for capital expenditures other than to support the current level of operations 
in fiscal  the partnership expects growth and maintenance capital expenditures to increase slightly over fiscal levels 
financing activities 
during the fiscal year ended july   the partnership borrowed  under its  credit facility the credit facility to fund expected seasonal working capital needs  business acquisitions  and capital expenditures 
at july    of borrowings were outstanding under the revolving portion of the credit facility 
in addition  letters of credit outstanding  used primarily to secure obligations under certain insurance arrangements  totaled  at july   the operating partnership had  available for general corporate  acquisition and working capital purposes under the credit facility 
the partnership typically has significant cash needs during the first quarter due to expected low revenues  increasing inventories and the partnership s cash distribution paid in mid september
