reduced sales to the retail craft industry comprised of and reduced sales at cushman comprised of 
the company s sales to the retail craft industry and its sales at cushman during were negatively impacted by challenging retail environments in the craft and western markets 
the company is making a concentrated effort to develop new products and sell to new markets due to the softness of sales and difficult conditions experienced by customers in the craft and western markets

while long term trends continue to be difficult to determine  management believes that those markets have stabilized although this may not be reflected in overall sales until the second half of costs  gross profit  and expenses cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was for as compared to for the difference in the relative cost of sales percentage was principally attributable to a change in sales mix  price competition in a very competitive market environment and direct labor costs associated with the labor dispute at cushman

early in the year  management believed that the positive trend in sales experienced in late and the first quarter of would continue 
the remaining three quarters of the year  however  proved this indication of increased sales to be temporary in nature 
sales in the fourth quarter of  outside of cushman  were down from the same quarter in absent cushman  tlf sales were down for the fiscal year 
costs  gross profit  and expenses cost of sales as a percentage of sales was for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to for the same period in the difference in the relative cost of sales percentage was principally attributable to a change in sales mix due to the softness described above  the competitive nature of the market  the fact that cushman operates on a somewhat lower gross margin than tlf  and higher prevailing leather prices  which were not or could not be passed along to customers

other income expense other expenses were  for the fiscal year ended december  compared to  during the same period in the difference between the two fiscal years involved increased interest expense
