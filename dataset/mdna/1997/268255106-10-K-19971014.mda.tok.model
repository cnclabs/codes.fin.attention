item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations a and liquidity and capital resources 
during fiscal years and  the company s principal sources of cash were receipts on accounts receivable  advances on contracts in the uk subsidiary and proceeds from the issuance of common stock  or exercise of stock options 
the principal uses of these funds were to make payments on the term loan and accounts payable and to finance acquisitions of property  plant and equipment 
during fiscal year  borrowings under the revolving credit facility were also a principal source of cash 
accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on completed contracts decreased at june  due to the completion or near completion of several contracts in the domestic training division 
accounts receivable increased at june  primarily due to billing on the company s large cost plus contract for which payment was received in july costs and estimated earnings decreased during fiscal year due to significant billings on several of the company s contracts which were completed or substantially completed in fiscal year raw material inventory decreased during fiscal year primarily due to the allocation of common parts to contracts in progress 
raw material inventory increased during fiscal year primarily due to the production of vending machines for stock in anticipation of future sales orders 
work in process inventory decreased during fiscal year primarily as a result of the award of certain contracts for which pre contract costs were included in work in process at june  work in process inventory increased during fiscal year  primarily due to the production of common parts which are used for various contracts 
finished goods inventory increased during fiscal year primarily due to the continued production of vending machines in anticipation of future sales orders as well as the production of assemblies and subassemblies in the training division 
prepaid expenses and other increased in fiscal year primarily due to the deferred tax assets resulting from accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes relating to the loss on disposal of discontinued operations including the phase out period 
in addition  a federal tax refund receivable was recorded for federal net operating losses realized in fiscal year see the components of the deferred tax asset in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in accounts payable at june  was primarily the result of a substantial slow down in material purchases as two of the company s largest contracts were completed or were near completion 
the increase in accounts payable at june  was primarily the result of material purchases in the vending operation as well as raw material purchase requirements under one of the company s major contracts 
advances on long term contracts increased at june  primarily as a result of payments received in advance of work performed on contracts in the uk subsidiary 
the increase in capital in excess of par at june  and was primarily the result of the purchase of stock under employee stock purchase plans  the exercise of stock options  as well as the tax benefit received from the exercise of employee stock options under one of the company s stock option plans 
the company did not comply with the minimum fixed coverage ratio at june  under its term loan and revolving credit agreement 
accordingly  the company has received irrevocable waivers from its bank lenders with respect to this covenant 
the term loan requires two final payments of  each  on july  and september  each payment was made on the respective due date 
the company anticipates spending approximately million for new machinery and equipment and to continue to refurbish the orlando facility during fiscal year other than as stated above  the company has no other material commitments for capital expenditures 
management believes that with the funds available under its loan facility and its projected cash flow the company will have sufficient resources to meet current and future operating commitments 
results of operations 
compared with as a result of the decision by the company to sell its vending operation  it has reflected the vending operation as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
continuing operations net sales decreased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease in net sales is primarily the result of several domestic training division contracts with reduced activity as they are complete or expected to be completed during the first quarter of fiscal year sales volume in the uk subsidiary increased modestly over the preceding year due to continued efforts on its two largest contracts 
gross margin decreased as a percentage of sales in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this decrease was due to gross margin adjustments on certain contracts in the uk subsidiary  a reduction in sales volume in the domestic training division as well as the continued change in contract mix in the domestic training division 
gross margin in the uk subsidiary decreased as a result of contract adjustments recorded during fiscal year gross margin adjustments were taken on its two large contracts due to protracted or delayed hardware software testing  re work required on trainers and late delivery penalties imposed due to contract delays 
in addition  gross margin adjustments were taken due to a decrease in expected future sales volume which may result in higher overhead rates than previously anticipated 
also see note to the consolidated financial statements 
domestic training also experienced a decrease in gross margin compared to the prior fiscal year 
while the company has experienced an increase in volume on its large domestic cost plus type contracts  these contracts generally yield lower gross margins than the fixed price type 
in addition  actual sales volume in fiscal was lower than expected due to the completion or near completion of numerous contracts which were not replaced by new business 
while cost reduction initiatives are underway  overhead and s  g a levels have not decreased proportionate to the decrease in sales volume 
since fiscal year management has effected a reduction in work force consistent with the reduction in contract volume 
however  costs associated with the reduction in work force including subcontracted labor  including severance benefits and out placement services  were incurred thereby minimizing the impact of the reduction in work force on gross margin 
all of these costs were paid during fiscal year system development expense increased in fiscal year as a result of efforts in the domestic training division to develop and or enhance technologies and processes in order to remain competitive in the industry 
these efforts are expected to continue through fiscal year interest income increased in fiscal year as a result of interest due the company based on the irs look back method of accounting for long term contracts 
interest expense increased marginally in fiscal year due to increased borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement during the first three quarters of fiscal year discontinued operations on september   the company announced a tentative agreement with maytag corporation for the purchase for cash by maytag of the technology  fixed assets  inventory and trade receivables of the company s vending operation 
the agreement is subject to final negotiations and a definitive agreement between the parties 
as such  discontinued operations include management s best estimate of the amounts expected to be realized on the proposed sale of its vending operation  the costs directly associated with the disposal of the operation  as well as the operating losses expected to be incurred during the phase out period 
the proposed sale is currently expected to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal year it is currently anticipated that proceeds from the sale of the vending operation will be used to reduce debt 
also see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating results have been segregated in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
net losses of the discontinued operation during were million loss per share  including the loss on disposal as well as provisions for operating losses during the phase out period of million 
this compares to million loss per share in the vending operation experienced a reduction in gross margin as a result of low sales volume which was not sufficient to cover overhead costs for the year 
compared with continuing operations the company had a net income of million from continuing operations in fiscal year  a decrease of versus fiscal year net income of million 
the decrease in profitability is primarily the result of changes in contract mix and adjustments to certain domestic and uk contracts 
gross margin decreased as a percentage of sales in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this decrease was due to gross margin adjustments on certain contracts of the domestic and uk training operations  as well as other factors 
the decrease in the domestic training operation is largely the result of the company s continued change in contract mix 
while the company has experienced an increase in volume on its large domestic cost plus type contracts  these contracts generally yield lower gross margins than the fixed price type 
a downward adjustment was taken in gross margin on the company s large domestic cost plus type contract during the second half of fiscal year this adjustment was due to revised manufacturing costs to complete based upon the initial unit production under the contract 
also  adjustments were taken to the gross margin of two fixed price domestic contracts primarily due to protracted acceptance schedules which resulted in higher than previously anticipated costs 
these adjustments were partially offset by the recognition of revenue associated with an economic price adjustment claim filed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
gross margin of the uk operation decreased due to adjustments on two major contracts 
the first contract adjustment resulted from customer requirements for extended testing on trainers 
the second contract adjustment was the result of completion of the design phase on the contract which led to a clarification of the complexity of detailed specifications 
the extended testing on one contract and recognition of the increased complexity of the trainer on another contract resulted in higher estimated costs than previously anticipated 
selling  general and administrative costs of the company increased or million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase was primarily the result of higher salaries and bid and proposal costs of the domestic and uk training divisions in order to meet increased business opportunities 
interest income decreased in fiscal year as interest due the company based on the irs look back method of accounting for completed contracts was substantially lower than the amount received in the previous fiscal year 
interest expense increased marginally in fiscal year due to higher borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
discontinued operations net losses of the discontinued operation were million 
loss per share in versus net income of  
per share in sales volume and gross margin decreased during fiscal year as the discontinued vending operation completed its large vending order to a major customer during the second third quarter and did not replace it with another large order 
as a result  efficiencies were not achieved due to low production volumes and fixed costs were marginally covered 
compared with continuing operations ecc had a net income of million in fiscal year  an increase of versus fiscal year net income of million 
this increase in profitability reflects a increase in sales over the prior year 
the increase in sales is primarily the result of increased volume company wide 
sales increased in fiscal year by million and million in the domestic training and uk training operations  respectively 
the increase in uk operation sales is the result of continued progress under an existing contract as well as progress on a million contract received in early fiscal year gross margin decreased as a percent of sales in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this decrease was due to gross margin adjustments on certain contracts of the domestic training and uk training operations as well as other factors 
an adjustment was taken to a cost plus incentive fee contract of the domestic training operation in fiscal year due to higher than originally anticipated costs 
in addition  during fiscal year there was an increase in volume on certain cost type contracts which typically yield lower gross margins than the company s typical fixed price contracts 
the write off of costs associated with the company s pop up target claim as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements further reduced gross margin in the domestic training operation during fiscal year gross margin as a percent of sales of the uk training operation decreased substantially in fiscal year versus fiscal year this decrease was the result of additional training requirements being identified on an existing contract  resulting in a reduction of contract gross margin 
also  a contract received in fiscal year contains a substantial amount of subcontract effort which results in a lower than normal gross margin 
selling  general and administrative costs of the company increased marginally in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase was primarily the result of increased administrative costs in the uk operation which were partially offset by a reduction in bid and proposal costs and legal expenses in the domestic training operation 
interest income increased in fiscal year as a result of interest due the company based on the irs look back method of accounting for completed contracts which was greater than the amount received in the previous year 
interest expense decreased in fiscal year as a result of the company s new loan facility which was negotiated under more favorable terms 
other  net changed from an expense in fiscal year to income in fiscal year primarily due to the absence  in fiscal year  of irs late payment penalties relative to tax deposits as well as reduced bank fees 
discontinued operations net income of the discontinued operation was  
per share in versus net losses of million 
loss per share in sales volume increased million due to the continued production of bottle vending machines under a contract procured late fiscal year as a result  gross margin of the discontinued vending operation improved from a loss in fiscal year to a gross margin contribution in fiscal year the company recorded a charge to vending cost of sales of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  primarily the result of a standard cost revision and an inventory book to physical adjustment 
selling  general and administrative costs of the discontinued vending operation increased million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase was primarily the result of higher salaries  technical support costs  marketing rep commissions  consulting fees and outbound freight costs 
systems development expense increased in fiscal year as a result of development costs primarily associated with the frozen vending machine which began production in late fiscal year statements of financial accounting standards not yet adopted in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

certain factors that may affect future operating results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
a number of uncertainties exist that could affect the company s future operating results  including  without limitation  general economic conditions  changes in government spending  cancellation of weapons programs  delays in contract awards  delays in the acceptance process of contract deliverables  the company s continued ability to develop and introduce products  the introduction of new products by competitors  pricing practices of competitors  the cost and availability of parts and the company s ability to control costs 
to date  a substantial portion of the company s revenues have been attributable to long term contracts with various government agencies 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting procurement of long term government contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
on september   the company announced a tentative understanding with maytag corporation whereby maytag would acquire the technology  fixed assets  inventory and trade receivables of ecc vending corp 
the understanding is subject to final negotiations and a definitive agreement between the parties
