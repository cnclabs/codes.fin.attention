the increases in the average sales prices in and were primarily due to price increases 
the gross margin percentage for decreased from and the gross margin percentage for decreased from these decreases resulted primarily from cost increases which were not offset by increases in sales prices 
new orders taken in increased from new orders taken in increased from the increase in new orders in reflects the continued demand for new single family homes which the company believes was brought about by strong consumer confidence  opening of new home communities and stable mortgage interest rates

interest interest paid and accrued for increased approximately compared to and increased approximately in compared to the increase in was primarily due to the sale of the company s senior notes in february  offset in part by a decrease in the average borrowings under the company s credit facility see financial condition and liquidity housing below  while the increase in was primarily due to an increase in the average borrowings under the company s credit facility 
the company capitalizes interest cost into housing inventories and charges the previously capitalized interest to interest expense when the related inventories are delivered 
the amount of interest capitalized and previously capitalized interest expensed in any one year is a function of the amount of housing assets  land sales and the number of housing units delivered  average outstanding debt levels and average interest rates 
in addition  the amount of previously capitalized interest charged to interest expense in and was affected by the amount of interest capitalized prior to because interest on a majority of the company s debt was stayed during the period of the company s bankruptcy proceedings 
capitalized interest amounts charged to interest expense in were greater than and primarily due to the increase in the number of housing units delivered and higher average debt levels  offset in part by an increase in the amount of housing assets qualifying for interest capitalization 
financial services revenues revenues for the financial services segment for the periods indicated were as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  us home mortgage corporation and us    other financial services subsidiaries    mortgage provides financing primarily to purchasers of homes sold by the company s housing operations through origination of residential mortgage loans and engages in the sale of such mortgages and related servicing rights to unaffiliated investors 
mortgage s operations are affected  among other things  by general economic conditions  consumer confidence and interest rate volatility 
these factors  together with the number of homes delivered by the company  affect the volume of loan originations which in turn impact the resulting volume of mortgages and servicing rights for sale 
the increase in mortgage s revenues in from and in from was primarily due to an increase in mortgage loan originations and income from the sales of mortgage loans and servicing rights 
other impairment of land inventories during the fourth quarter of  in conjunction with the completion of the business plan  the company completed its annual detailed evaluation of the intended use of its land inventories to insure that the primary and planned use reflected the appropriate economic value for the company s intended use 
even though industry forecasts project a softening in housing demand in  no change in use was required for most of the company s land inventories 
however  it was determined during the evaluation that based on economic forecasts for the current best use of certain land inventories located primarily in florida  maryland and texas had changed from the company s previous intended use 
the change in intended use for these land inventories include land previously held for long term development which will now be sold to other builders in the near term to accelerate its disposition  land that has been replanned for new products and land affected by changes in product pricing 
based on the change in intended use  the company revised its cash flow estimates and determined the cash flow expected to be generated from the new intended use would be less than the cost of the land 
accordingly  the company recorded a non cash provision for impairment of approximately million million  net of income taxes to reduce the carrying value of the land to its current fair value  which amount has been included in provision for impairment of land inventories in the consolidated statements of operations 
fair value was determined based on sales contracts or offers received on land being sold and by evaluations of comparable market prices 
the provision for impairment reduced primary and fully diluted income per share in by 
per share and 
per share  respectively 
corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative includes the operations of the company s corporate office 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses were  and for  and  respectively 
actual corporate overhead expenses for totaled million compared with million and million  respectively  for and the increase for over was primarily due to increased payroll expense 
income taxes during the fourth quarter of  the internal revenue service the irs completed an examination of the company s federal income tax returns for the years ended december  and the results of this examination allowed certain previously reserved deductions taken by the company in its tax return 
however  certain other deductions claimed by the company in that year were disallowed by the irs 
at the conclusion of this examination  the company reduced its deferred tax liability and recognized an income tax benefit totaling million related to the deductions allowed by the irs 
the company plans to appeal the irs decision to disallow certain other deductions and these deductions remain reserved as a deferred tax liability as of december  the decrease in the deferred tax liability increased primary and fully diluted income per share in by 
per share and 
per share  respectively 
financial condition and liquidity housing the company s most significant needs for capital resources are land and finished lot purchases  land development and housing construction 
the company s ability to generate cash adequate to meet these needs is principally achieved from the sale of homes and the margins thereon  the utilization of company owned lots and borrowings under its financing facilities  including the credit facility see below 
access to quality land and lot locations is an integral part of the company s success 
typically  in order to secure the rights to quality locations and provide sufficient lead time for development  the company must acquire land rights well in advance of when orders for housing units are expected to occur 
the company attempts to minimize its exposure to the cyclical nature of the housing market and its use of working capital by employing rolling lot options  primarily in its affordable and move up home communities  which enable the company to initially pay a small portion of the total lot cost and then purchase the lots on a scheduled basis 
over the last three years  approximately of the units delivered have been on lots acquired under rolling lot option agreements 
the increase in land inventories in from and from was primarily the result of increased activities  including an increase in the company s retirement and active adult communities activities 
the company has financed  and expects to continue to finance  its working capital needs from operations and borrowings  including those made under the company s million unsecured revolving credit agreement credit facility entered into in september the credit facility and previous credit facilities have enabled the company to meet peak operating needs 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in february  the company sold million principal amount of its senior notes due the net proceeds thereof were used to repay the then outstanding balance under the credit facility and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
also  certain of the properties owned or under option by the company may be located within community development districts districts formed by municipalities to construct and finance certain infrastructure improvements on property in the districts area 
the districts utilize ad valorem and assessment revenue bonds to fund improvements and repay the bonds by annual tax assessments on district property based on the property s relative value to other district property 
the company provides no credit support for and is not liable for the debt of the districts  except to the extent of actual assessments made by the districts 
the company may utilize districts to a greater extent in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that it will do so 
the net cash provided or used by the operating  investing and financing activities of the housing operations for the years ended december   and is summarized below dollars in thousands years ended december  net cash provided used by operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    net increase decrease in cash    housing operations are  at any time  affected by a number of factors  including the number of housing units under construction and housing units delivered 
housing construction and land asset activities increased in over and in over housing operating activities for used more cash than in primarily due to an increase in these activities offset in part by increased profitability and the timing of payments related to these activities 
housing operating activities for used less cash than in primarily due to increased profitability and the timing of payments related to these activities 
cash flow from housing financing activities in provided cash reflecting the sale of the company s senior notes  partially offset by the repayment of the amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
cash flow from housing financing activities increased in from primarily due to increased net borrowings under the company s revolving credit facilities 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet its current working capital obligations and other needs 
however  should the company require capital in excess of that which is currently available  there can be no assurance that it will be available 
financial services mortgage s activities represent a substantial portion of the financial services segment s activities 
as loan originations by mortgage are primarily from homes sold by the company s home building operations  mortgage s financial condition and liquidity are to a significant extent dependent upon the financial condition of the company 
financial services operating activities are affected primarily by the volume of mortgage s loan originations and the timing of the sale of mortgage loans and related servicing rights to third party investors 
loans and servicing rights are generally sold to investors within days after homes are delivered 
in this regard  cash required by financial services operating activities for was higher compared to and was higher compared to primarily due to an increase in residential mortgage loan receivables 
the company finances its financial services operations primarily from short term debt which is repaid with internally generated funds  such as from the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans and related servicing rights 
as more fully discussed in notes of notes to consolidated financial statements  the short term debt consists of a million secured revolving line of credit the mortgage credit facility which matures on august  while the mortgage credit facility contains numerous covenants  including a debt to tangible net worth ratio and a minimum tangible net worth requirement  these covenants are not anticipated to significantly limit mortgage s operations 
the company has no obligation to provide funding to its financial services operations  nor does it guarantee any of its financial services subsidiaries debt 
the company believes that internally generated funds and the mortgage credit facility will be sufficient to provide for mortgage s working capital needs 
other impact of inflation inflation not only affects interest rates on funds borrowed by the company  but also affects the affordability of permanent mortgage financing available to prospective customers 
increased construction costs associated with rising interest rates  as well as increased material costs  compress gross margins in the short term  but may be recovered in the long term through increases in sales prices  although such increases may reduce sales volume 
in recent years  inflation has not had a significant adverse effect on the company

given the risks  uncertainties and contingencies of the company s business  the actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
further  certain forward looking statements are based on assumptions concerning future events which may not prove to be accurate 
forward looking statements by the company regarding results of operations and  ultimately  financial condition  are subject to numerous risk and assumptions  including the following general economic and business conditions  the level and direction of interest rates and the level of consumer confidence have significant impact on the willingness and ability of purchasers to enter into contracts for homes and to consummate purchases of such homes under contract backlog  as well as on the performance of mortgage  the company s principal subsidiary 
the development of many of the company s communities  particularly its retirement and active adult communities  result from a lengthy  complex series of events involving land purchase  regulatory compliance  capital availability  marketing and sales  any of which can materially affect the financial results for a community 
the company is in a highly competitive and fragmented industry  which places constant pressure on price including the ability of the company to respond to increases in prices from its suppliers  quality and marketing and particularly challenges the company upon any entry into new geographic markets 
the company faces numerous regulatory hurdles in its development efforts  such as laws and regulations regarding zoning  environmental protection  building design and construction  density and rate of development 
the company s access to capital sufficient to fund its development activities is affected by the company s financial leverage and by the willingness of the capital markets and banks to absorb equity or debt of the company 
the company may encounter other contingencies  including labor shortages  work stoppages  product liability  litigation  natural risks such as floods or hurricanes and other factors over which the company has little or no control
