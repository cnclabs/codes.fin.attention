item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
gulf of mexico through its predecessors  the company has been involved in exploration and exploitation of properties in the gulf of mexico since the s 
in general  vastar s properties in the gulf of mexico are characterized by prolific reservoirs with high production rates  which therefore tend to deplete more rapidly than the company s onshore properties 
in  the company purchased an additional percent working interest in the west cameron field for million  bringing vastar s total interest in the field to approximately percent and adding proved reserves net to vastar of bcfe 
the transaction also increased vastar s ownership in the gibbstown and grand chenier gas separation stations 
the company s current production portfolio in the gulf of mexico includes key fields operated by vastar and operated by others 
the company also has an ownership interest in four gas processing plants  which process gas produced primarily from the gulf of mexico 
the company s assets in the gulf of mexico represented percent of the company s total reserves as of december  approximately percent of the company s total capital program was invested in this region 
gulf coast the company s properties in the gulf coast area include key fields 
the company also has an ownership interest in three gas processing plants in southeast texas and south louisiana and approximately million net acres of mineral fee acreage located primarily in southeast texas 
most of the company s properties in this area have been producing gas since the s and s and are relatively mature 
the company operates approximately percent of its production in the gulf coast area 
the company s assets in the gulf coast area represented percent of the company s reserves as of december  approximately nine percent of the company s total capital program was invested in this region 
san juan rockies the san juan basin  located in southwestern colorado and northwestern new mexico  is one of the largest gas basins in the united states in terms of proved reserves 
development of the company s properties in the san juan basin s fruitland coal seam began in the late s 
the company s production from the coal seam fields  specifically the ignacio blanco fruitland field located in southwestern colorado and basin fruitland field northwestern new mexico  is long lived 
vastar also has significant remaining reserves in the conventional reservoirs in the san juan basin  which are also long lived 
the company also has minor production in the powder river basin in wyoming 
the company s assets in the san juan rockies area represented percent of the company s reserves as of december  approximately seven percent of the company s total capital program was invested in this region 
most of the company s fruitland coal formation production in the san juan basin qualifies for internal revenue code section coal seam tax credits against regular federal income tax  which are available through during  the company generated section tax credits for all production  including production from the fruitland coal formation  of approximately million 
see section tax credits 
mid continent the company s properties in the mid continent region include key fields located primarily in the hugoton  arkoma and ardmore basins  and the arklatex areas 
these properties are characterized by relatively long lived production  shallow decline rates and low lease operating costs 
in addition  the company has an ownership interest in two gas processing plants in this region 
in september  the company added to its mid continent portfolio by purchasing additional property in the spider and logansport fields in desoto parish  louisiana for million  which the company estimates added approximately bcfe of proved developed reserves 
the company s assets in the mid continent area represented percent of the company s reserves as of december  approximately percent of the company s total capital program was invested in this region 
exploration exploration assets the company holds approximately million net acres located primarily in its core areas 
at december   this land position included million net undeveloped acres  including mineral fee acreage totaling million net undeveloped acres 
this land position provides the resource base for the company s exploration prospects 
the following table summarizes the company s acreage position as of december  developed acreage undeveloped acreage gross net gross net in thousands gulf of mexico  arkansas colorado kansas louisiana mississippi montana new mexico oklahoma texas   wyoming other total     approximately ten percent of vastar s undeveloped net acreage as of december  will expire in each of the next five years 
the company was active in offshore lease sales in  purchasing approximately  net acres for approximately million  much of this acreage is in water deeper than meters 
at december   the company s gulf of mexico holdings were slightly over one million net acres  including a deepwater position of approximately  net acres 
as a corollary to its offshore lease sale activity  in september  the company entered into a contract with diamond offshore drilling company for the major upgrade and operation of diamond offshore s semisubmersible drilling rig  ocean victory  for a three year deepwater drilling program in the gulf of mexico  commencing in late see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company owned or had rights to d seismic data covering approximately  blocks offshore and  square miles onshore and million miles of d seismic data covering its producing properties and unexplored acreage in its portfolio and other acreage

reserve replacement producing gas and oil reservoirs are  in general  characterized by declining production rates 
as a result of these decline trends  the company must find and develop or acquire new reserves to offset the natural field decline 
in  the company increased proved reserves from a beginning of the year balance of approximately  bcfe to an end of year balance of approximately  bcfe 
see consolidated financial statements supplemental information oil gas producing activities 
the following table sets forth the company s historical proved acquisition  finding and development costs and proved reserve additions since finding and development costs millions of dollars unproved property acquisition costs exploration costs development costs total finding and development costs proved property acquisition costs total reserve replacement costs proved reserve additions bcfe extensions and discoveries revisions improved recovery total reserve additions  excluding purchases of minerals in place purchases of minerals in place total reserve additions finding and development costs per mcfe reserve replacement costs per mcfe proved reserves the following table sets forth estimated net proved gas and oil reserves of the company as of december  unless otherwise noted  all information in this report on form k relating to gas and oil reserves is based upon estimates prepared by the company and is net to the company s interest 
proved reserves developed undeveloped total natural gas bcf   petroleum liquids mmbbl total proved reserves bcfe   in calculating mcf and bbl equivalents  one bbl is equal to six mcf 
proved gas and oil reserve quantities are based on estimates prepared by the company s engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission the sec and approximately percent were reviewed by ryder scott company petroleum engineers ryder scott  independent petroleum engineers 
a copy of the review letter by ryder scott has been filed as an exhibit to this report on form k 
the reserve data set forth in this report on form k represent estimates only 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the company 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates made by different engineers often vary 
in addition  the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimates  and such revisions may be material 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of gas and oil that are ultimately recovered

marketing the company sells substantially all its natural gas production to its wholly owned subsidiary  vastar gas marketing  inc vastar gas 
the company s position as one of the largest domestic gas producers provides the base for vastar gas marketing and trading activities 
vastar gas is one of the largest gas marketers in the united states with marketed volumes averaging bcfd in the key strategies which produced these results were pursuing term sales agreements with local distribution companies  electric utilities and industrial users who were willing to pay amounts in addition to a commodity value for wholesale aggregation services  providing gas asset management services to this same customer base to optimize usage of transportation and storage assets and buying and selling natural gas  based on information obtained from vastar gas wholesale customer base  to take advantage of market opportunities 
during  an average of bcfd was sold under day spot contracts 
the remaining bcfd in gas sales were sold under contacts greater than days  with the exception of a small volume sold through direct wellhead and gas plant contracts 
vastar gas most significant source of gas supply is the natural gas production controlled by vastar  including proprietary production  royalty gas  call rights on third party gas and gas obtained through joint operating agreements 
this gas is sold to vastar gas at floating  market related prices 
in  vastar gas obtained an average of approximately bcfd of gas from these sources 
for the remainder of its gas supply requirements  vastar gas purchased gas from third parties  including producers and other gas marketing companies 
most of these purchases were day spot transactions 
in  such third party purchases averaged approximately bcfd 
vastar gas obtains day spot gas primarily in support of its trading activities  to minimize transportation costs and to facilitate management of its long term commitments 
natural gas sales averaged bcfd in up from bcfd in the average sales price for natural gas was per mcf  an increase of percent over  due to higher commodity market prices 
vastar gas has various longer term natural gas sales contracts under which it has contracted to deliver an aggregate of mmcfd in these obligations decline to less than mmcfd by the year the majority of these contracts are either index based and present little or no price risk or are reservoir dedicated and present no obligation to deliver if production from the dedicated reservoir ceases 
natural gas production controlled by vastar  including proprietary production  royalty gas  call rights on third party gas and gas obtained through joint operating agreements  is expected to exceed these delivery commitments 
there have been no instances in the last three years in which vastar gas was unable to meet any significant natural gas delivery commitment 
in  vastar gas had additional longer term contracts with certain cogeneration facilities pursuant to which it delivered an average of mmcfd 
these contracts had an average contract term of approximately years  for which an average of years remain 
in  the average price of gas sold under these contracts was approximately per mcf 
the company also markets its proprietary crude oil production 
crude oil sales averaged mbbld in the average price realized for crude oil was per bbl  an increase of percent over the majority of this increase reflects stronger commodity prices as compared to in connection with the marketing of its crude oil production  the company exchanges barrels of crude oil as an alternative to physical transportation of the company s crude oil production and to achieve other efficiencies 
in accounting for these transactions  the exchanged barrels represent the majority of the difference between vastar s proprietary crude oil production and its total crude oil sales volumes 
with regard to the company s natural gas liquids ngls production  until april  vastar had a month to month sales contract with arco for the sale of substantially all of vastar s proprietary ngl production 
under this contract  the pricing for the ngls production generally reflected standard industry terms for similar contracts and was intended to approximate the net price vastar would obtain if it marketed its ngls on a term basis to end users 
consistent with the company s crude oil marketing strategy  the company began marketing its own natural gas liquids on april  ngl sales averaged mbbld in the average price realized for ngls was per bbl  an increase of percent over the majority of this increase reflects stronger commodity prices as compared to in  vastar power marketing  inc  a subsidiary of the company  obtained a ferc power marketing certificate 
this positioned the company to offer a wider array of products and services to its customers 
in  vastar power began marketing electricity to a small number of customers and expects to continue such marketing activity as opportunities become available 
the power marketing business presents unique risks and opportunities that are inherently different from the company s hydrocarbon marketing businesses 
risk management from time to time  the company uses various hedging arrangements  predominantly natural gas and crude oil price swaps  to manage the company s exposure to price risk from its natural gas and petroleum liquids production 
these hedging arrangements have the effect of locking in for specified periods at predetermined prices or ranges of prices the prices the company will receive for the volumes to which the hedge relates 
as a result  while these hedging arrangements are structured to reduce the company s exposure to decreases in price associated with the hedged commodity  they can also limit the benefit the company might otherwise have received from any price increases associated with the hedged commodity 
vastar gas also uses certain financial instruments  such as natural gas price swaps and futures  to manage its fixed price purchase and sale commitments  as well as to provide fixed price commitments as a service to its customers and suppliers 
although vastar gas generally attempts to balance its fixed price physical and financial purchase and sales contracts in terms of contract volumes and timing of delivery obligations  net open positions may exist from time to time 
vastar gas has established specific limits relative to these net open positions and has established internal controls to monitor such positions against established limits 
the limits require that vastar gas net open position not exceed the volume of production controlled by the company 
however  to the extent that vastar gas has an open position  the company may be exposed to risk from fluctuating market prices 
for additional information relating to risk management  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
competition competition in the oil and gas industry is intense in the lower states 
the company actively competes for the acquisition of reserves and exploration leases  licenses and concessions  sometimes against companies with greater financial and other resources 
to the extent the company s financial resources are less than those of its competitors  the company may be disadvantaged in effectively competing for certain reserves  leases  licenses and concessions 
from time to time  the level of industry activity may result in a tight supply of labor or equipment required to operate and develop such properties 
in marketing its production  the company competes with other producers and marketers on such factors as deliverability  price  contract terms and quality of service 
the company believes that the location of its properties  its exploration  drilling and production expertise and the experience of its management generally enable it to compete effectively 
seasonality historically  demand for natural gas has been seasonal in nature  with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 
regulation the company s ability to produce and market its gas and oil production is affected and restrained by a number of factors  including federal and state regulation of natural gas and oil production  state limits on allowable rates of production by well or proration unit  the amount of natural gas and oil available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels 
in april  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  which regulates natural gas transportation  issued order no 
 an order designed to restructure the interstate natural gas transportation and marketing system and remove various barriers and practices that have historically limited non pipeline natural gas sellers  including producers and marketing companies  such as the company and vastar gas  from effectively competing with interstate pipelines 
to date  order no 
has not had any material adverse effect on the company 
however  because the ultimate restructuring requirements that emerge from the lengthy administrative and judicial review process may be significantly different from those currently in effect  and because implementation of the restructuring may vary by pipeline  it is not possible to predict what  if any  effect the ultimate restructuring resulting from order no 
will have on the company 
additional proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before the ferc and the courts 
the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated  therefore  there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the ferc and congress will continue 
in  approximately half of the company s production was located on federal or indian oil and gas leases  which are administered by various agencies of the department of interior  such as the minerals management service  the bureau of land management and the bureau of indian affairs 
such leases are often issued through competitive bidding  contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed regulations and orders 
prior to commencing drilling  lessees must obtain permits and approvals from the applicable federal agency as well as from other federal agencies such as the coast guard  army corps of engineers and the environmental protection agency 
these agencies have promulgated regulations which require production facilities to meet stringent engineering  construction and environmental specifications and which govern the plugging and abandonment of wells and the removal of production facilities 
the various states in which the company operates regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring  among other things  drilling permits  bonds and operations reports and environmental and conservation matters including unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties and the establishment of maximum production rates 
some states prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas and such proration rules or orders may be detrimental to the company s profitability when such rules or orders prevent the company from producing quantities sufficient to meet its market opportunities 
some counties and municipalities also regulate drilling and production operations 
the company s operations are also subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  handling  emission  transportation and discharge of materials into the environment 
permits are required for the operation of various facilities of the company  and these permits are subject to revocation  modification and renewal by issuing authorities 
governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations  and violations are subject to fines  injunctions or both 
it is possible that increasingly strict requirements will be imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder 
it is not anticipated that the company will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total capital expenditures program by reason of environmental laws and regulations  but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed  the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of such compliance 
the company s domestic competitors are generally subject to the same environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  and the company believes that its circumstances and potential expenditures are comparable to those faced by its major domestic competitors 
however  future environmentally related capital expenditure requirements  liabilities and costs could be a major factor affecting the company s future income and cash flow 
section tax credits federal tax law provides an income tax credit against regular federal income tax liability with respect to sales of the company s production of certain fuels produced from nonconventional sources including natural gas from coal seams and tight sands formations  subject to a number of limitations section tax credits 
fuels qualifying for the credit must be produced from wells drilled after december   and before january   and must be sold before january  the basic credit  which is approximately per mmbtu of natural gas  is phased out as the price of oil exceeds per barrel in dollars adjusted for inflation  with complete phaseout if such price exceeds per barrel in dollars similarly adjusted 
under this formula  the commencement of phaseout would be triggered if the average price for oil rose above approximately per barrel in current dollars 
the credit for natural gas from coal seams is adjusted for inflation and is expected to be approximately per mmbtu for the credit for tight sands gas is not adjustable and remained approximately per mmbtu in the natural gas production from wells drilled on certain of the company s properties  primarily in the san juan basin  qualifies for the section tax credit 
the company generated approximately million of section tax credits in  approximately percent of which was attributable to production of natural gas from coal seams 
the company and its subsidiaries join with arco and its domestic subsidiaries in filing a consolidated federal income tax return 
the company and arco have entered into a tax sharing agreement the tax sharing agreement  effective october   as amended effective june   relating to these taxes 
under the tax sharing agreement  the company is able to use its section tax credits to reduce its federal income tax payments to arco but  except as stated below  not below zero i to the extent that such credits would reduce its liability on a stand alone tax basis or ii if such credits would be statutorily limited on a stand alone tax basis  then to the extent that such credits are used by the arco tax group as defined in the tax sharing agreement 
in addition  the company is allowed to use its section tax credits to reduce its federal income tax payments to arco below zero and receive cash refunds from arco if the conditions described in ii above are met and if such credits are generated by production from properties acquired by the company in the ordinary course of business on or after june   provided  however  that the company s ability to reduce its liability below zero and generate cash refunds from arco is limited to a maximum of million in and million per year thereafter 
under certain limitations of the current agreement  credits that cannot be used by the company on a current year basis are carried forward  and used to reduce future federal income tax payments to arco in any subsequent year in which the company and arco join in filing a consolidated federal income tax return 
subsequent to year end  arco and vastar have agreed in principle to a second amendment to the tax sharing agreement 
this amendment will remove certain limitations under the original agreement and generally will allow vastar to receive payment for all section tax credits in the year generated 
in return the company has agreed to a percent reduction in the value of the credits generated from properties acquired by the company before june  arco and vastar have also agreed to apply the same reduction to the million of section tax credits carried forward as of december  in exchange for immediate payment upon execution of the second amendment 
human resources the company had  employees as of december  the company believes its relationships with its employees are satisfactory 
employees covered by collective bargaining agreements total and are with the following unions oil  chemical and atomic workers international union employees  and the atlantic independent union employees 
cautionary statement for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of safe harbor cautionary statement vastar desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions contained in section a of the securities act of  as amended the act  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the act  and is including this statement herein in order to do so 
from time to time  the company s management or persons acting on the company s behalf may wish to make  either orally or in writing  forward looking statements which may come within the meaning of section a of the act and section e of the act  to inform existing and potential security holders regarding various matters including  without limitation  projections regarding future income  oil and gas production  production and sales volumes of the company s products  oil and gas reserves and the replacement thereof  capital spending  as well as predictions as to the timing and success of specific projects 
such forward looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as estimate  project  predict  believes  expect  anticipate  goal or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
forward looking statements by their nature are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions and will be influenced by various factors 
should one or more of these forecasts or underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results could vary materially 
the factors below are believed to be important factors but not necessarily all the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed herein could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters which are the subject of forward looking statements 
the company does not intend to update these cautionary statements 
volatility and level of hydrocarbon commodity prices the company s projections as to the level of future earnings are based on various assumptions as to the future prices of natural gas  ngls and crude oil 
these price assumptions are used for planning purposes and the company expects they will change over time 
any substantial or extended decline in the actual prices of natural gas  ngls and or crude oil could have a material adverse effect on i the company s financial position and results of operations including reduced cash flow and borrowing capacity  ii quantities of natural gas  ngls and crude oil reserves that may be economically produced and iii the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to the company s properties 
these prices historically have been volatile and may vary based on factors affecting commodities markets generally  changes in market demand and fluctuations in political  regulatory and economic climates in one or more regions throughout the world 
production rates and reserve replacement projecting future rates of gas and oil production is inherently imprecise 
producing gas and oil reservoirs generally have declining production rates 
production rates depend on a number of factors  including geological  geophysical and engineering factors  weather  production curtailments or restrictions  prices for natural gas  ngls and crude oil  market demand and the political  economic and regulatory climate 
another major factor affecting production rates is the company s ability to replace depleting reservoirs with new reserves through exploration success or acquisitions 
exploration success is impossible to predict  particularly over the short term  where results can vary widely year to year  moreover  the ability to replace reserves over an extended period depends not only on the total volumes found  but on the cost of finding and developing such reserves 
depending on the general price environment for natural gas  ngls and crude oil  the company s finding and development costs may not justify the use of resources to explore for and develop such reserves 
acquisitions that yield cost effective and successful exploration or exploitation opportunities require assessment of numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
there can be no assurance that the company s acquisition of property interests will be successful and  if unsuccessful  that such failure will not have an adverse effect on the company s future results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurances as to the level or timing of success  if any  that the company will be able to achieve in finding and developing or acquiring additional reserves 
reserve estimates proved gas and oil reserve quantities are based on estimates prepared by the company s engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
the reserve data disclosed by the company  either orally or in writing  represent estimates only 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the producer 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates made by different engineers often vary 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimates  and any such revision may be material 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of gas and oil that are ultimately recovered 
laws and regulation the company s forward looking statements are generally based upon the assumption of a stable legal and regulatory environment 
the company s ability to economically produce and market its gas and oil production is affected and could possibly be restrained by a number of legal and regulatory factors  including  but not limited to  federal and state laws and regulation of natural gas and oil production  federal and state tax laws and regulations  state limits on allowable rates of production by well or proration unit  as well as by laws and regulations which may affect the amount of natural gas and oil available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels 
the company s operations are also subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  handling  emission  transportation and discharge of materials into the environment 
it is possible that increasingly strict requirements will be imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder 
the company s forward looking statements are generally based upon the expectation that it will not be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total capital expenditures program by reason of environmental laws and regulations 
however  inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed  the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of such compliance 
drilling and operating risks the company s drilling operations are subject to various risks common to the industry  including cratering  explosions  fires and uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids 
in addition  approximately half of the company s operations are currently offshore and subject to the additional hazards of marine operations  such as capsizing  collision and damage or loss from severe weather 
the company s drilling operations involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reserves will be encountered 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents and adverse weather conditions 
competition the company s forward looking statements are generally based upon a stable competitive environment 
however  competition in the oil and gas industry is intense 
the company actively competes for reserve acquisitions and exploration leases  licenses and concessions  as well as in the gathering and marketing of natural gas  ngls and crude oil  sometimes against companies with greater financial and other resources 
the company s competitors include the major oil companies  independent oil and gas concerns  individual producers  natural gas  ngls and crude oil marketers and major pipeline companies  as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
to the extent the company s exploration and exploitation budget is lower than that of certain of its competitors  the company may be disadvantaged in effectively competing for certain reserves  leases  licenses and concessions 
from time to time  the level of industry activity may result in a tight supply of labor or equipment required to operate and develop oil and gas properties 
for example  competition for drilling rigs is keen in the gulf of mexico 
recently  the company began to experience increases in drilling rig rental rates due to the tight rig market in the gulf of mexico 
the availability of drilling rigs as well as the level of drilling rig rates will have an effect on the company s ability to achieve success in its exploration and production activities 
in marketing its production  the company competes with other producers and marketers on such factors as price  product availability  contract terms and quality of service 
in making projections with respect to natural gas  ngls and crude oil marketing  the company assumes no material decrease in the availability of natural gas  ngls and crude oil for purchase

v 
amoco  et al  case no 
cv  in the district court for laplata county durango  colorado  and which was originally filed in may vastar is one of seven defendants in this case in which the plaintiffs have alleged widespread methane gas contamination 
on june   the trial court granted vastar s motion to dismiss vastar from the litigation on the grounds  inter alia  that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims asserted against vastar 
the plaintiffs filed notice of appeal to the colorado court of appeals and on february   the court affirmed the trial court s order dismissing the litigation 
the plaintiffs applied for a writ of certiorari to the colorado supreme court and on august   the plaintiffs withdrew their application 
the colorado court of appeals has remanded the case to the trial court for the determination of attorney s fees due to vastar and the other defendants from the plaintiffs 
vastar has been named as a defendant in six additional lawsuits brought by individuals in united states district court for the district of colorado 
vastar has filed motions to dismiss the remaining lawsuits on the grounds that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction or  in the alternative  to stay the proceedings under the tribal exhaustion doctrine 
on december   the united states district court granted vastar s motion to stay and the remaining six plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
the tenth circuit has dismissed the plaintiffs appeal on the basis that the order to stay entered by the district court was not final and therefore non appealable 
on october   vastar met with the united states environmental protection agency  region viii epa or the agency  to apprise the agency of certain results obtained from vastar s internal self evaluation and audit program 
these results concern issues associated with the prevention of significant deterioration psd permit program under the federal clean air act at vastar s ignacio blanco fruitland ibf coal degasification operations 
these operations are located on the southern ute indian reservation in laplata county in southwestern colorado 
through its self evaluation and audit program  vastar determined that a psd permit may be required for the operation of certain of its natural gas compression facilities associated with its ibf operations due to unanticipated levels of carbon monoxide emissions 
under federal law  the epa has the power to seek injunctive relief and civil penalties for violations of the federal clean air act 
liability for failure to obtain a psd permit under the clean air act can be imposed without regard to willfulness or negligence 
the company sought the benefits of the epa s voluntary environmental self policing and self disclosure interim policy statement interim policy statement  which management believed would allow the company to substantially reduce or avoid any punitive penalties  although the epa would still be entitled to recover any economic benefit associated with noncompliance 
on october   the company made a written submittal to the epa pursuant to the interim policy statement 
in january  the us department of justice  acting on behalf of the epa  and the company agreed to settle the matter 
under the terms of the settlement  vastar agreed to pay a  civil penalty 
this amount represents vastar s economic benefit of noncompliance  as the settlement reflected vastar s avoidance of punitive penalties under the interim policy statement 
in addition  arco  the previous owner of the natural gas compression facilities  agreed to pay a  civil penalty 
under the terms of the settlement  the finalization of which is subject to certain minor conditions precedent  neither vastar nor arco admitted liability with respect to the matter 
a stipulation of settlement between the united states and arco has been entered in the united states district court for the district of colorado and the  arco civil penalty has been paid 
in connection with the october conveyance of the ibf facilities from arco to vastar  vastar agreed to indemnify arco against certain claims or liabilities to which arco could be subject relating to arco s historical ownership and operation of the facilities 
pursuant to such agreement  vastar has paid the arco civil penalty 
vastar and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of other lawsuits  all of which have arisen in the ordinary course of business in operating vastar s properties or the former arco oil and gas company division and vastar gas business affairs 
further  pursuant to the cross indemnification agreement dated as of october   between vastar and arco  vastar has assumed any and all liabilities incurred before or after the effective date of that certain general conveyance and assumption agreement  dated october   as modified as of december   and december   between vastar and arco that are associated with the ownership or operation of the subject properties as defined therein  except for certain scheduled litigation and other liabilities 
the company does not believe that any ultimate liability resulting from any of the claims and suits described or referred to in paragraphs through above will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operation of the company

earned per share amounts prior to the year ended december   have been omitted because vastar was a wholly owned subsidiary of arco until june prior to october   there were no special dividends to arco because all cash receipts of vastar were submitted to arco and cash disbursements were funded by arco 
the ratios were computed by dividing earnings by fixed charges 
for this purpose  earnings include income before income taxes and fixed charges 
fixed charges include interest  amortization of debt expenses and the estimated interest component of rentals 
prior to the inception of the company on october   the determination of fixed charges is not applicable in that the company had no incurred debt

the following information should be read in connection with the information contained in the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
general vastar was formed out of the reorganization of arco s lower exploration and production operations  when arco transferred to vastar certain producing properties  developed and undeveloped acreage  related liabilities and working capital 
sales and production volumes and price statistics for the specified periods were as follows for the years ended december  natural gas sales mmcfd    average production mmcfd average sales price per mcf average wellhead price per mcf crude oil sales mbbld average production mbbld average realized price per bbl ngls average production mbbld average realized price per bbl the following table sets forth the statements of income for the years ended december   and these statements of income are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 
for the years ended december  millions of dollars revenues natural gas sales    purchases  delivery expense net sales crude oil sales purchases delivery expense net sales ngls and other sales purchases other net sales net sales and other operating revenues other revenues net revenues expenses operating expenses exploration expenses selling  general and administrative expenses taxes other than income taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization interest total expenses income before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income for of million more than doubled when compared to the earnings increase primarily reflected higher commodity prices and production volumes  partially offset by higher production and exploration costs 
net sales and other operating revenues increased by million to million for  primarily as a result of higher prices and sales volumes for natural gas  crude oil and ngls 
natural gas sales increased percent to  million during the higher revenues were a result of higher trading activity levels and an increase in commodity prices 
reflected in natural gas revenues for was the unfavorable impact of million pre tax or per mcf sold  related to the company s natural gas price hedging activities 
natural gas purchases increased in by  million from to  million 
this increase was a result of the combined effect of a percent increase in natural gas purchased volumes  which rose to an average of approximately bcfd to support the higher trading activity levels  and a percent increase in the cost of gas purchased  which was driven by higher commodity prices 
natural gas production for averaged mmcfd  up eight percent from the previous year 
contributing to the increase were the continuing growth of san juan basin production  the january start up of the high island extension discovery and ongoing exploitation successes throughout vastar s core areas 
these improvements more than offset natural field declines during crude oil sales in were million  an increase of percent from the prior year primarily  as a result of higher commodity prices 
crude oil production was mbbld in  an increase of five percent from the increase reflected higher production primarily from the south pass and west delta fields  partially offset by natural field declines 
natural gas liquids and other sales were million for  reflecting a percent increase over the prior year 
this increase resulted from a combination of higher ngl prices and a percent increase in production volumes 
the increase in production volumes  reflected a higher ownership in an onshore gas plant and increased processing volumes 
other revenues of million decreased million in as compared to the other revenues were generated primarily from leasing undeveloped mineral fee acreage in east texas 
the other revenues were generated primarily from the receipt of a million payment in settlement upon the termination of a disputed long term acreage dedicated gas sales contract 
exploration expenses were million compared to million for the million increase was primarily related to higher seismic data purchases and dry hole costs associated with the increased exploration activities in during  the company s expenditures for seismic data increased percent to million as a result of tripling its onshore seismic database and increasing its offshore seismic database by percent 
of the million  percent was attributable to investments required to establish a presence in the deepwater gulf of mexico play 
selling  general and administrative costs increased by million to million in this increase was primarily a result of the expansion of vastar s marketing services 
taxes other than income taxes increased million during primarily as a result of higher revenues 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased in to million compared to million in primarily due to increased volumes 
included in these costs was a million and a million non cash pre tax charge for and  respectively  for the impairment of the company s oil and gas properties and facilities 
the income tax benefit of million in reflected higher pre tax earnings and higher section tax credits as compared to the company recognized million and million for and  respectively  of section tax credits for non conventional fuels 
the increase in tax credits in was largely the result of increasing san juan coalbed methane production 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income for was million compared to million in this decrease primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of lower natural gas prices realized in natural gas sales decreased million in  primarily as a result of a per mcf decrease in average sales prices from in to in included in the average sales price were hedging gains of per mcf sold 
this decrease was partially offset by a six percent increase in sales volumes to over bcfd reflective of increased production and stepped up trading activity by vastar gas 
natural gas purchases decreased by million  or three percent  from levels  notwithstanding a seven percent increase in natural gas purchase volumes to an average of approximately bcfd necessary to meet higher sales levels 
the impact of increased purchase volumes was more than offset by a nine percent decrease in the cost of gas purchased 
natural gas production increased mmcfd to mmcfd in offshore natural gas production remained relatively constant at mmcfd during  compared to mmcfd during field declines were offset by increased production from the mustang island field  the fourth quarter start up of south marsh island and the start up of mustang island onshore production increased mmcfd to mmcfd 
this increase was primarily due to increased coalbed methane gas production in the san juan basin  reflecting continued de watering of the coal seams and further projects to debottleneck and expand gas gathering and compression facilities 
crude oil sales increased million and mbbld  over three times levels 
crude oil purchases were million in  up from million in  reflecting an increase in purchase volumes of mbbld 
these increases primarily reflect the company s exchange barrel transactions which occurred for the first time in as a result of the company s decision to begin in house marketing of its crude oil in january the purchase and sale of exchange barrels  when available  are used as an alternative to physical transportation of the company s crude oil production 
crude oil production was flat year to year and averaged mbbld in production from the start up of the west delta and south marsh island fields offset the effects of natural field decline 
the net revenue contribution from these crude oil production and marketing activities was million  up percent from  resulting in an average realized price for the company s crude oil production of per barrel in  a percent increase over these increases reflect not only stronger crude oil commodity prices as compared to  but also the premium generated by value added services from crude oil marketing activities 
ngls increased million  primarily as a result of increased production volumes and higher prices 
ngls purchases increased to million from million in  reflecting the recognition of the purchase and resale of royalty and joint owners share of ngls volumes which were purchased directly by arco in and prior periods 
ngls production was mbbld in  an increase of percent over the prior year 
the higher volumes resulted from increased ngls processing in order to capitalize on the favorable ngls natural gas price differentials that the industry experienced in other revenues increased million to million during this increase was due to the million received in settlement upon the termination of a disputed long term acreage dedicated gas sales contract  partially offset by a decrease in interest income as a result of reduced cash balances in exploration expenses increased million in this increase is primarily due to increased seismic data gathering activity and higher dry hole costs associated with the increased exploration budget for these increased expenses were partially offset by lower undeveloped leasehold amortization resulting from a longer life expectancy of the leasehold base 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million from to  primarily due to higher production volumes 
in the fourth quarter of  vastar adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
as a result  the company recognized a non cash pre tax charge related to its oil and gas properties of million 
the decrease in interest expense is due to the reduction in long term debt from billion at december   to a balance of million at december   partially offset by interest rate increases 
the tax benefit of million during and the tax provision of million in include million and million  respectively  of internal revenue code section tax credits for non conventional fuels 
during  vastar received a reimbursement of million from arco for estimated federal income tax payments made in risk management from time to time  the company uses various hedging arrangements  predominantly natural gas and crude oil price swaps  to manage the company s exposure to price risk from its natural gas and petroleum liquids production 
these hedging arrangements have the effect of locking in for specified periods at predetermined prices or ranges of prices the prices that the company will receive for the volumes to which the hedge relates 
as a result  while these hedging arrangements are structured to reduce the company s exposure to decreases in price associated with the hedged commodity  they can also limit the benefit the company might otherwise have received from any price increases associated with the hedged commodity 
vastar gas also uses certain financial instruments  such as natural gas price swaps and futures contracts  to manage its fixed price purchase and sale commitments  as well as to provide fixed price commitments as a service to its customers and suppliers 
although vastar gas generally attempts to balance its fixed price physical and financial purchase and sales contracts in terms of contract volumes and timing of delivery obligations  net open positions may exist from time to time 
vastar gas has established specific limits relative to these net open positions and has established internal controls to monitor such positions against established limits 
the limits require that vastar gas net open position not exceed the volume of production controlled by the company 
however  to the extent that vastar gas has an open position  the company may be exposed to risk from fluctuating market prices 
natural gas spot prices fluctuated between per mcf and per mcf henry hub and crude oil prices fluctuated between per bbl and per bbl nymex wti at cushing in the company realized approximately million and million of pre tax losses in and  respectively  as a result of the various hedging transactions for natural gas and crude oil 
since these transactions were considered to be hedges on production  these losses are included in sales and other operating revenues and are reflected in the average sales price of the particular products 
as of december   the company had entered into a series of natural gas swap agreements covering an average of approximately mmcfd of its natural gas production from january  to december   and approximately mmcfd of its natural gas production for the period january  through december  these swap agreements serve as a hedge which secures sales prices averaging approximately per mcf for and per mcf for in addition  the company has entered into various gas price collar agreements covering an average of mmcfd of its january  through march  production and mmcfd of its april  through december  production 
these agreements have a floor which will allow the company to receive no less than an average of per mcf and a ceiling which will allow the company to receive no more than an average of per mcf on the related first quarter production and no less than an average of per mcf and no more than an average of per mcf on the related second to fourth quarter production 
the company has also entered into a series of production location specific natural gas swaps covering an average of approximately mmcfd of its january  through march  production and mmcfd of its april  through december  production 
these swap agreements serve as a hedge which secures sales prices averaging approximately per mcf during the first quarter of and per mcf during the period april  through december  as of december   the company has entered into oil price collar agreements covering mbbld of its january through june crude oil production 
these agreements have a floor which will allow the company to receive no less than an average of per barrel on the related production and a ceiling which will allow the company to receive no more than an average of per barrel each on a wti at cushing basis 
based on forward price quotes from brokers and nymex forward prices as of december   the deferred pre tax loss to the company for the hedged transactions for and would be million for natural gas and million for crude oil 
the actual gains or losses realized by the company from such hedges may vary significantly from the foregoing amounts due to the fluctuation of prices in the commodity markets 
since december   the company has entered into additional natural gas swap agreements 
these agreements cover an average of mmcfd of the company s san juan basin natural gas production for the period april  through october  and an average of mmcfd of the company s production for the period april  through september  these swap agreements serve to secure an average price of per mcf and per mcf for the and periods  respectively 
since december   the company has executed a gas price collar covering mmcfd of its natural gas production for the period april  through october  this agreement secures a price in which the company will receive no less than per mcf and no more than per mcf for the subject gas during this time period
