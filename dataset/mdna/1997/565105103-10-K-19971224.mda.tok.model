the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  the following issues and risks  among others  should be considered in evaluating mapinfo s outlook and future 
new products and technological change 
the mapping software and information business is characterized by extremely rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  and frequent new product introductions 
these conditions require continuous expenditures on product research and development to enhance existing products and to create new products 
the company believes that the timely development of new products and continuing enhancements to existing products is essential to maintain its competitive position in the marketplace 
during fiscal  the company introduced a number of new products  including spatialware  proserver and mapx 
the company s future success depends  in part  upon customer and market acceptance of these new products 
any failure to achieve acceptance of these and other new product offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete the development of new or enhanced products or successfully manage transitions from one product release to the next 
competition 
the company encounters significant competition in the market for business mapping systems worldwide 
increased competition may lead to pricing pressures that could adversely affect the company s gross margins 
prices of software in europe and asia are generally higher than in the americas to cover localization costs and higher costs of distribution 
such price uplifts could erode in the future 
reliance on third parties 
the company relies in part on strategic partners and independent developers for the development of specialized data products that use mapinfo software 
failure by such strategic partners or independent developers to continue to develop such data products  or changes in the contractual arrangements with such strategic partners or independent developers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
expansion to enterprise market 
the company has previously marketed its products primarily in the desktop mapping market 
the company has recently expanded its product offerings beyond the desktop market to the enterprise and internet intranet markets 
sales to the enterprise and internet intranet markets are directed to different decision makers within customer organizations and require different selling and marketing programs than are used in the desktop market 
the failure of these products to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
prices 
future prices the company is able to obtain for its products may decrease from previous levels depending upon market or competitive pressures or distribution channel factors 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dollars in thousands  except earnings per share intellectual property rights 
the company regards its software as proprietary and attempts to protect it with a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure agreements  and other methods of protection 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s products  reverse engineer or obtain and use information the company regards as proprietary 
in addition  the company s shrinkwrap licenses  under which the company licenses its products  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions  and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
any misappropriation of the company s intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future with respect to current or future products 
any such assertion could require the company to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues varies with the mix of technology development and licensing fees  product revenues  and services revenues  as well as with the distribution channel mix 
changes in the revenue mix  as well as the distribution model  may affect cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues in the future 
risks associated with international operations 
revenues outside the americas increased from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal and to of revenues in fiscal the international portion of the company s business is subject to a number of inherent risks  including the difficulties in building and managing international operations  reliance on financial commitments from certain international distributors  difficulties in localizing products and translating documentation into foreign languages  fluctuations in the value of international currencies  fluctuations in import export duties and quotas  and unexpected regulatory  economic  or political changes in international markets 
changes in international business conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
year compliance 
the company s salable products rely on software applications 
the company also relies on systems of other parties in regards to its business  accounting and operational software 
the company believes that its salable products  as well as its significant business  accounting and operations software are year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties with the conversion of these systems 
the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure of its systems and applications or those operated by other parties to properly manage dates beyond accounting standards
