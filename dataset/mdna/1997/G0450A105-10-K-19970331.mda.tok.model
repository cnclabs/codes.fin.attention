item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company rchi is the holding company for risk capital reinsurance  its wholly owned subsidiary which is domiciled in nebraska 
rchi was incorporated in march and commenced operations during september upon completion of the offerings 
rchi received aggregate net proceeds from the offerings of approximately million  of which million was contributed to the capital of risk capital reinsurance 
on november   risk capital reinsurance was licensed under the insurance laws of the state of nebraska 
as of december   the statutory surplus of risk capital reinsurance was approximately million 
recent industry performance the property and casualty reinsurance industry has been highly cyclical 
this cyclicality has produced periods characterized by intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortage of capacity permitted favorable premium levels 
demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by underwriting results of primary property and casualty insurers and prevailing general economic and market conditions  all of which affect liability retention decisions of primary insurers and reinsurance premium rates 
the supply of reinsurance is related directly to prevailing prices and levels of surplus capacity  which  in turn  may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being realized in the reinsurance industry 
the cyclical trends in the industry and the industry s profitability can also be affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments  including changes in the propensity of courts to grant larger awards  natural disasters such as catastrophic hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  floods and fires  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment that affect market prices of investments and the income and returns on investments  and inflationary pressures that may tend to affect the size of losses experienced by ceding primary insurers 
reinsurance treaties that are placed by intermediaries are typically for one year terms with a substantial number that are written or renewed on january each year 
other significant renewal dates include april  july and october the january  renewal period was marked by continuing intensified competitive conditions in terms of premium rates and treaty terms and conditions in both the property and casualty segments of the marketplace 
these conditions have worsened due to large domestic primary companies retaining more of their business and ceding less premiums to reinsurers 
while the company is initially somewhat disadvantaged compared to many of its competitors  which are larger  have greater resources and longer operating histories than the company  it believes it has been able to generate attractive opportunities in the marketplace due to its substantial unencumbered capital base  experienced management team and relationship with its equity investment advisor as well as its strategic focus on generating a small number of large reinsurance treaty transactions that may also be integrated with an equity investment in client companies 
at january   the company had in force treaties  with approximately million of annualized in force premiums 
such in force premiums represent estimated annualized premiums from treaties entered into during and the january  renewal period that are expected to generate net premiums written during calendar year all of such treaties are subject to renewal 
without taking into account the possibility that x several of the treaties entered into during that are scheduled to expire during the remainder of may be renewed and y additional new treaties may be bound during  it is estimated that the company will record approximately million of net premiums written over the twelve month period ending december  from such treaties 
such estimates of in force premiums and net premiums written at january  do not include the unearned premium portfolios and other non recurring transactions reflected in the company s net premiums written for because such portfolios and transactions will not generate any net premiums written during results of operations for the year ended december  and for the period june  date of inception to december   the company had consolidated net income of approximately million  or per share  and million  or per share  respectively 
after tax realized investment gains of million  or per share  and million  or per share  were also included in net income for the and periods  respectively 
net income for included a loss of million  or per share  representing the company s equity in the net loss of an investee company which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the company believes that the results of operations for the year ended december  are not necessarily indicative of its future financial results due to a number of factors  including i the potential increase in net premiums written indicated by the company s january  renewal season activity  ii the company s emphasis on targeting casualty business that is longer tail than its current mix of business and iii the company s investment strategy 
increased premium writings  particularly longer tail casualty business  can generally be expected to generate higher underwriting losses than the business recorded in because of the related requirement to establish claims liabilities that are adequate to cover the costs of anticipated future claim payments without taking into account the time value of money 
the amount of investment income earned that may offset underwriting losses from quarter to quarter could vary and diminish as the company continues to employ its strategy of investing a substantial portion of its investment portfolio in publicly traded and privately held equity securities of insurance companies and insurance related entities 
investments in equity securities yield less current investment income than fixed maturity investments 
variability and declines in the company s results of operations could be further exacerbated by private equity investments in start up companies which are accounted for under the equity method 
such start up companies may be expected to initially generate operating losses 
accordingly  the company s results of operations for the year ending december  may vary from quarter to quarter and from the financial results reported by the company in  and could also produce operating losses 
unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments to the extent that it occurs for investments carried at fair value is recorded in a separate components of stockholders equity  net of related deferred income taxes 
such gains or losses are recorded in net income to the extent investments are sold 
the timing and recognition of such gains and losses are unpredictable and not indicative of future operating results 
net premiums written net premiums written for the year ended december  were as follows in thousands year ended december  property casualty multi line specialty total approximately million  or  of net premiums written resulted from unearned premium portfolios and other non recurring transactions 
this amount includes million of specialty premiums written from contracts pursuant to which the company reinsures a portion of one underlying policy for multiple years 
such premiums will be earned over the multiple periods as the exposures expire 
approximately of net premiums written was from non us clients which are lloyd s syndicates or are located in the united kingdom and continental europe 
operating costs and expenses one traditional means of measuring the underwriting performance of a property casualty insurer  such as the company  is the statutory composite ratio 
this ratio  which is based upon statutory accounting principles which differ from generally accepted accounting principles in several respects  reflects underwriting experience  but does not reflect income from investments 
a statutory composite ratio of under indicates underwriting profitability  while a composite ratio exceeding indicates an underwriting loss 
set forth below is the company s statutory composite ratio for the year ended december  and the estimated aggregate statutory composite ratio for domestic reinsurers based on data reported by the raa as of such date year ended december  claims and claims expenses commissions and brokerage other operating expenses statutory composite ratio domestic reinsurer aggregate statutory composite ratios claims and claims expenses generally represent the company s most significant and uncertain costs 
reserves for these expenses are estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given time of what the company expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims to cost based on facts and circumstances then known 
the reserves are based on estimates of claims and claims expenses incurred and  therefore  the amount ultimately paid may be more or less than such estimates 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating claim reserves are exacerbated for reinsurers by the significant periods of time the tail that often elapse between the occurrence of an insured claim  the reporting of the claim to the primary insurer and  ultimately  to the reinsurer  and the primary insurer s payment of that claim and subsequent indemnification by the reinsurer 
as a consequence  actual claims and claims expenses paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from estimates reflected in the company s reserves reported in its financial statements 
the estimation of reserves by new reinsurers  such as the company  may be less reliable than the reserve estimations of a reinsurer with an established volume of business and claim history 
to the extent reserves prove to be inadequate  the company may have to augment such reserves and incur a charge to earnings 
such a development  while not anticipated  could occur and result in a material charge to earnings or stockholders equity in future periods 
subject to the foregoing  the company believes that the reserves for claims and claims expenses are adequate to cover the ultimate cost of claims and claims expense incurred through december  in pricing its reinsurance treaties  the company focuses on many factors  including exposure to claims and commissions and brokerage expenses 
commissions and brokerage expenses are acquisition costs that generally vary by the type of treaty and line of business  and are considered by the company s underwriting and actuarial staff in evaluating the adequacy of premium writings 
other operating expenses increased to million for the year ended  compared to million for the period june  date of inception to december  the other operating expense ratio component of the statutory composite ratio was reduced by percentage points due to the premiums written generated from assumed unearned premium portfolios and other non recurring transactions 
assuming the successful execution of the company s business strategy  the company expects other operating expenses to grow commensurate with maturing operations  but expects other operating expenses to decline moderately as a percentage of net premiums written because increases in premium writings are generally expected to exceed the growth in such expenses 
risk retention given the company s current level of surplus  under its underwriting guidelines  the maximum net retention on any one claim or occurrence for property and casualty treaty risks will generally be million 
the company will evaluate its retrocessional requirements periodically in relation to many factors  including its surplus capacity  gross line capacity and changing market conditions 
other than the company s participation in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties  the company currently does not maintain retrocessional arrangements on a per risk or per treaty basis  or for the purpose of limiting its exposure with respect to catastrophe losses or unusual accumulations of losses resulting from a single occurrence involving two or more reinsured policies 
the company believes that such exposures are currently adequately managed through appropriate terms and conditions and pricing of reinsurance contracts 
common account retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies with respect to a reinsurance treaty  including the cedent 
the company monitors its earthquake and wind exposures and continuously reevaluates its estimated probable maximum pre tax loss for such exposures through the use of modeling techniques 
the company generally seeks to limit its probable maximum pre tax loss to no more than of its statutory surplus for severe catastrophic events that could be expected to occur once in every years and that would result in insurance industry wide losses ranging from approximately to billion depending on the catastrophe exposure zone a year event 
this limitation includes combined exposure to underwriting losses  reinstatement costs for retrocessional arrangements which may be in force at the time of the losses resulting from the catastrophic event and losses that the company may be exposed to as a result of its privately held investments in insurance and insurance related entities 
while the company believes its risk management techniques are adequate  there can be no assurances that the company will not suffer pre tax losses greater than of its statutory surplus from a catastrophic event due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating the frequency and severity of such exposures 
in addition  the company believes that it cannot reasonably estimate its exposure to unrealized investment losses if any that may result from the company s investments in publicly traded securities of insurance and insurance related entities 
with respect to integrated transactions where the company combines an equity or equity like investment in a client company with the purchase by such client of reinsurance from the company  the company generally limits its combined underwriting and investment exposure to pre tax losses on any individual client to no more than of its total statutory surplus  and subjects these commitments to intensive scrutiny by the combined professional staffs of both the company and risk capital corp 
investment results at december   approximately of the company s invested assets consisted of fixed maturity and short term investments compared to at december  net investment income for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to million for the period june  date of inception to december  as discussed above  the amount of investment income from quarter to quarter may vary and could diminish as the company continues to employ its strategy of investing a substantial portion of its investment portfolio in publicly traded and privately held equity securities  which generally yield less investment income than fixed maturity investments 
the company s investment yields at amortized cost were as follows for the periods set forth below june  year ended date of inception to december  december  investment yields pre tax net of tax assuming a stable interest rate environment  the company anticipates such yields to moderately decline as funds invested in short term securities are allocated into equity securities 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate of for the year ended december  and for the period june  date of inception to december  are less than the statutory rate on pre tax operating income due to tax exempt income and the dividends received deductions 
the and gross deferred income tax benefits of approximately million and million  respectively  which are assets considered recoverable from future taxable income  result from temporary differences between financial and taxable income 
investments a principal component of the company s investment strategy is investing a significant portion of invested assets in publicly traded and privately held equity securities  primarily issued by insurance and reinsurance companies and companies providing services to the insurance industry 
cash and fixed maturity investments and  if necessary  the sale of marketable equity securities will be used to support short term liquidity requirements 
as a significant portion of the company s investment portfolio will generally consist of equity securities issued by insurance and reinsurance companies and companies providing services to the insurance industry  the equity portfolio will lack industry diversification and will be particularly subject to the cyclicality of the insurance industry 
unlike fixed income securities  equity securities such as common stocks  including the equity securities in which the company may invest  generally are not and will not be rated by any nationally recognized rating service 
the values of equity securities generally are more dependent on the financial condition of the issuer and less dependent on fluctuations in interest rates than are the values of fixed income securities 
the market value of equity securities generally is regarded as more volatile than the market value of fixed income securities 
the effects of such volatility on the company s equity portfolio could be exacerbated to the extent that such portfolio is concentrated in the insurance industry and in relatively few issuers 
as the company s investment strategy is to invest a significant portion of its investment portfolio in equity securities  its investment income in any fiscal period may be smaller  as a percentage of investments  and less predictable than that of other insurance companies  and net realized and unrealized gains losses on investments may have a greater effect on the company s results of operations or stockholders equity at the end of any fiscal period than other insurance and or reinsurance companies 
because the realization of gains and losses on equity investments are not generally predictable  such gains and losses may differ significantly from period to period 
investments that are or will be included in the company s private portfolio include securities issued by privately held companies and by publicly traded companies that are generally restricted as to resale or are otherwise illiquid and do not have readily ascertainable market values 
the risk of investing in such securities is generally greater than the risk of investing in securities of widely held  publicly traded companies 
lack of a secondary market and resale restrictions may result in an inability by the company to sell a security at a price that would otherwise be obtainable if such restrictions did not exist and may substantially delay the sale of a security the company seeks to sell 
at december   cash and invested assets totaled approximately million  consisting of million of cash and short term investments  million of publicly traded fixed maturity investments  million of publicly traded equity securities and million of privately held securities 
included in privately held securities are two investments totaling million which are accounted for under the equity method 
see note under the caption investment information of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements of the company for certain information regarding the company s publicly traded and privately held securities and their carrying values  and commitments made by the company relating to its privately held securities 
over the long term  the company intends to continue to allocate a substantial portion of its cash and short term investments into publicly traded and privately held equity securities  subject to market conditions and opportunities in the marketplace 
the fixed maturity and short term investments were all rated investment grade by moody s investors service  inc or standard poor s corporation and have an average quality rating of aa and an average duration of approximately years 
at december   the company is obligated under letters of credit approximating million  which secure certain reinsurance obligations and investment commitments in amounts of approximately million and million  respectively 
securities with a carrying value of approximately million have been pledged as collateral for a portion of these letters of credit 
the company has not invested in derivative financial instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps  or options or other financial instruments with similar characteristics such as interest rate caps or floors and fixed rate loan commitments 
liquidity and capital resources rchi is a holding company and has no significant operations or assets other than its ownership of all of the capital stock of risk capital reinsurance  whose primary and predominant business activity is providing reinsurance and other forms of capital to insurance and reinsurance companies and making investments in insurance related companies 
rchi will rely on cash dividends and distributions from risk capital reinsurance to pay any cash dividends to stockholders of rchi and to pay any operating expense that rchi may incur 
the payment of dividends by rchi will be dependent upon the ability of risk capital reinsurance to provide funds to rchi 
the ability of risk capital reinsurance to pay dividends or make distributions to rchi is dependent upon its ability to achieve satisfactory underwriting and investment results and to meet certain regulatory standards of the state of nebraska 
there are presently no contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends or the making of distributions by risk capital reinsurance to rchi 
nebraska insurance laws provide that  without prior approval of the nebraska director  risk capital reinsurance cannot pay a dividend or make a distribution together with other dividends or distributions paid during the preceding months that exceeds the greater of i of statutory surplus as of the preceding december or ii statutory net income from operations from the preceding calendar year not including realized capital gains 
net income exclusive of realized capital gains not previously distributed or paid as dividends from the preceding two calendar years may be carried forward for dividends and distribution purposes 
any proposed dividend or distribution in excess of such amount is called an extraordinary dividend or distribution and may not be paid until either it has been approved  or a day waiting period has passed during which it has not been disapproved  by the nebraska director 
notwithstanding the foregoing  nebraska insurance laws provide that any distribution that is a dividend may be paid by risk capital reinsurance only out of earned surplus arising from its business  which is defined as unassigned funds surplus as reported in the statutory financial statement filed by risk capital reinsurance with the nebraska insurance department for the most recent year 
in addition  nebraska insurance laws also provide that any distribution that is a dividend and that is in excess of risk capital reinsurance s unassigned funds  exclusive of any surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets  will be deemed an extraordinary dividend subject to the foregoing requirements 
see business insurance regulation regulation of dividends and other payments from insurance subsidiaries and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
rchi and risk capital reinsurance file consolidated federal income tax returns and have entered into a tax sharing agreement the tax sharing agreement  allocating the consolidated income tax liability on a separate return basis 
pursuant to the tax sharing agreement  risk capital reinsurance makes tax sharing payments to rchi based on such allocation 
net cash flow from operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  consisting principally of premiums received  investment income and net investment gains  offset by operating costs and expenses 
the primary sources of liquidity for risk capital reinsurance are net cash flow from operating activities  principally premiums received  the receipt of dividends and interest on investments and proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments 
the company s cash flow is also affected by claims payments  some of which could be large 
therefore  the company s cash flow could fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the company does not currently have any material commitments for any capital expenditures over the next months other than in connection with the further development of the company s infrastructure 
the company expects that its financing and operational needs for the foreseeable future will be met by the company s balance of cash and short term investments  as well as by funds generated from operations 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in the implementation of its business strategy 
at december   the company s consolidated stockholders equity totaled million  or per share 
at such date  statutory surplus of risk capital reinsurance was approximately million 
based on data available as of december  from the raa  risk capital reinsurance is the twelfth largest domestic broker market oriented reinsurer as measured by statutory surplus 
accounting pronouncement the company has elected to continue to account for its stock based compensation under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations under apb no 
the company does not recognize any compensation expense for its grants of employee stock options because the exercise price of the company s employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
in addition  under apb no 
 the company does not recognize compensation expense for stock issued to employees under its stock purchase plan 
the alternative to apb no 
is the financial accounting standards board fasb no 
accounting for stock based compensation  which requires fair value accounting for stock based compensation 
this alternative requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
therefore  the company believes that the existing models do not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of employee stock options that have vesting provisions and are not transferable 
for additional discussion  see note under the caption employee benefits and compensation arrangements of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
set forth below is pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share  assuming the company had accounted for its employee stock options under fasb no 
using a black scholes option valuation model in thousands  except per share data june  year ended date of inception to december  december  net income  as reported   proforma net income  earnings per share  as reported proforma earnings per share the effect on net income and earnings per share after applying fasb no 
s fair valuation method to stock issued under the company s employee stock purchase plan does not materially differ from the pro forma information set forth above with respect to the company s employee stock options 
insurance regulation risk capital reinsurance  in common with other insurers  is subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in the various states and jurisdictions in which it transacts business 
the laws and regulations of the state of nebraska  the domicile of risk capital reinsurance  have the most significant impact on its operations 
from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance and reinsurance industry  some of which could have an effect on reinsurers 
among the proposals that have in the past been or are at present being considered are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to  or in lieu of  the current system of state regulation of insurers and proposals in various state legislatures some of which proposals have been enacted to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the naic 
the company is unable to predict whether any of these laws and regulations will be adopted  the form in which any such laws and regulations would be adopted  or the effect  if any  these developments would have on the operations and financial condition of the company 
see business insurance regulation 
certain provisions of the nebraska insurance laws are proposed to be amended through a bill that is currently before the nebraska legislature 
if such legislation is adopted  the proposed amendments could have a material impact on the investment strategy of the company

effects of inflation the effects of inflation on the company will be implicitly considered in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid claims and claims expenses 
the actual effects of inflation on the results of the company cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled
