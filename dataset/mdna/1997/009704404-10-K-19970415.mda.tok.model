sales of golf products increased by million in the mass market and million in the golf specialty store market 
the specialty market increase was due to a full year of ownership of palm springs golf  inc  acquired in october the mass market sales increase was due to increased sales to the second largest customer as a result of the purchase of a golf line of business from korex corporation in october sales of furniture products increased million  or 
the furniture business began in august and contributed  of sales in that short year 
during  the company found it financially difficult to integrate the newly acquired palm springs golf  inc business 
during this first full year of operations  the pre tax loss for palm springs was million

the turnaround of palm springs is much deeper than originally expected  but management believes these efforts will continue to reposition palm springs for a return to market competitiveness and profitability in the leisure life business continues to grow at a rapid pace 
this was a startup business acquired in august during its first full year   it had sales of million and grew to million in corresponding pre tax losses were  and  management expects this business segment to emerge to profitability in as sales continue to grow

offsetting the above declines was the acquisition of product lines from a former competitor  korex corporation  in october this contributed approximately million of additional sales 
ajay has undertaken steps to continue to improve results in its sales programs 
operating loss for the company was  in  a decrease of million compared to an operating profit of  in the million turnaround in operating profit resulted from integrating the newly acquired palm springs golf  inc and the newly acquired golf product line from korex corporation in october

it is believed that this phase is substantially completed 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million representing  and of sales in  and respectively

capital resources the company expended  in for capital expenditures  which was used principally for building and equipment improvements and moving club manufacturing to mexico 
the company s capital expenditures for were  which was used principally for construction of additional factory space for leisure life and tooling new products 
liquidity cash flow from operations was negative by  reflecting the effect from a million net loss and a partial offset from increased trade payables 
financing of the negative cash flow came from increased bank loans and loans from affiliated parties 
the company s liquidity is primarily affected by its financing requirements 
the seasonal nature of the company s sales creates fluctuating cash flow  due to the temporary build up of inventories in anticipation of  and receivables during  the peak seasonal period which historically has been from february through may of each year 
the company has relied and continues to rely heavily on revolving credit facilities for its working capital requirements 
the adverse operating results of palm springs golf subsequent to its acquisition has used approximately million of the company s liquidity 
this has resulted in the company s current bank lender advising the company that the bank contends that the company is in technical default under its loan agreement and the bank has restricted the funds available to ajay under the agreement 
ajay had been operating up until february  on a revolver limit of million 
on february  the line was reduced to a million maximum facility 
the company did and has continued to make all interest payments on time and has operated within the limit amounts contained in the old and new facility lines  although restrictions during february and march curtailed operating capability and reduced sales and profitability opportunities otherwise available 
this constriction has forced the company to rely on extended credit terms from its venders and additional funds from affiliated parties 
on april  the bank agreed to waive the existing default and restructure the line to its former million limit although requiring a  term loan payment in june and contains less favorable formula borrowing rates and an increased interest rate 
the restructured facility will terminate on june  the increase in the line will provide the liquidity the company needs during the second quarter 
in order to find a more permanent solution to easing the liquidity situation  the company has been seeking alternative financing
