the walden comparable store sales increase of reflects flat mall traffic levels and the impact of increased superstore competition offset by the benefit of new merchandising initiatives 
walden also experienced a benefit from a larger number of seasonal calendar kiosks introduced in malls with existing walden stores and stores expanded to a larger format 
gross margin as a percent of sales rose  from in to in the increase in gross margin percentage reflects the impact of consolidated distribution operations and improved buying and sales mix resulting in higher initial product margin  reduced depreciation as a result of the fourth quarter sfas write off and tighter control of inventory shrinkage 
as a percentage of sales  sg a for was  or less than the of sales in the corresponding period of the decrease is due largely to the leveraging of corporate overhead over the company s expanding sales base  as well as headcount reductions and related wage savings resulting from the move of the waldenbooks headquarters from stamford  connecticut to ann arbor  michigan 
pre opening expense in was million as compared to million in pre opening expense per store varies primarily as a result of differing levels of grand opening advertising  depending on the presence of the company in the market  and differing levels of labor costs associated with opening the store 
the company opened borders superstores and waldenbooks mall based stores in as compared to borders superstores and waldenbooks mall based stores in goodwill amortization was million in  as compared to million in the decrease in goodwill amortization of million is a result of the lower goodwill balance due to the noncash writedowns of goodwill in see goodwill writedown

the walden comparable store sales decrease reflects continuing sluggish mall traffic and increased competition from superstores  offset by an increase from a larger number of calendar kiosks introduced in malls with existing walden stores and stores expanded to a larger format 
gross margin as a percent of sales rose  from in to in the increase in gross margin percentage reflects lower occupancy as a percent of sales of the borders superstores offset in part by the continuing impact of music sales  which have a lower gross margin  as an increasing percentage of the company s total sales 
rapid expansion of the company s books and music superstore business has resulted in a relatively immature superstore base  with of all books and books and music superstores in operation less than two years as of january  management expects that continued expansion of the superstore base as well as general maturation of the superstore operations will allow for increased operating leverage and potentially higher operating margins 
as a percentage of sales  sg a for was  or less than the of sales in the corresponding period of the decrease is due largely to the leveraging of corporate overhead over the company s expanding sales base  as well as headcount reductions and related wage savings resulting from the move of the waldenbooks headquarters from stamford  connecticut to ann arbor  michigan 
the company also incurred a charge of million in  associated with borders stock appreciation rights  which was not repeated in pre opening expense in was million as compared to million in pre opening expense per store varies primarily as a result of differing levels of grand opening advertising  depending on the presence of the company in the market  and differing levels of labor costs associated with opening the store

accordingly  the company s operating results for periods prior to that date do not reflect interest expense on intercompany transactions 
additionally  the company incurred pre tax interest expense of million in  relating to the purchase of kmart s remaining interest in the company 
income tax expense in was million  as compared to million in the effective tax rate for both periods differed from the statutory rate primarily as a result of non deductible goodwill amortization and writedown and the fas charge 
excluding the non recurring charges  goodwill amortization and writedown and a portion of the fas charge  the company s effective tax rate was in as compared to in as a result of the foregoing  net income for the year ended january   excluding non recurring charges for the goodwill writedown and the effect of the adoption of fas  was million as compared to million  excluding non recurring charges in liquidity and capital resources the company s principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs  the opening of new stores and the refurbishment and expansion of existing stores 
net cash provided by operations in was million  as compared to million in the current year activity primarily reflects income before non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and increases in taxes payable as a result of timing of estimated payments offset by cash used for inventories as a result of store expansion at borders 
inventory net of accounts payable increased primarily due to new borders stores 
net cash used for investing was primarily for capital expenditures for new stores and  in  the acquisition of planet music 
capital expenditures in reflect the opening of new superstores and new waldenbooks stores and the addition of the columbus distribution center 
capital expenditures in also included expenditures for the company s combined headquarters facilities and data processing equipment 
capital expenditures for stores in reflect the opening of new stores superstores and mall based stores  conversion of two walden owned superstores to borders books and music superstores  the relocation of three book superstores  expansions of stores five superstores and mall based stores  and capital expenditures on stores scheduled to open in early net cash used for financing in was million  resulting primarily from net repayments of borrowings under the credit facility  offset by cash received for construction funding  the issuance of company stock under the company s employee benefit plans  and the sale of put options on the company s common stock 
net cash used for financing in was million  which resulted from net borrowings under the credit facility  offset by cash used for the repayment of borrowings from kmart and the purchase of kmart s remaining interest in the company 
the company expects capital expenditures to be approximately million in the company currently plans to open approximately borders superstores and new  expanded or relocated waldenbooks mall stores in average cash requirements for the opening of a prototype borders books and music superstore are million  representing capital expenditures of million  inventory requirements  net of related accounts payable  of million and million of pre opening costs 
average cash requirements to open a new or expanded waldenbooks store range from million to million  depending on the size and format of the store 
the company plans to lease new store locations predominantly under operating leases 
the company anticipates that planned closings of walden stores will decrease walden s annual working capital requirements 
on a consolidated basis  the company expects its working capital requirements to increase as a result of its expansion program for its borders books and music superstores 
the company plans to execute its expansion plans for its borders superstores principally with funds generated from operations and financing through the lease facility in and beyond 
in the event that working capital requirements are in excess of operating cash flows and lease financing  the company may fund such excess with borrowings under the credit facility 
the company believes funds generated from operations  borrowings under the credit facility and financing through the lease facility will be sufficient to fund its anticipated capital requirements for at least the next two to three years 
in  the company announced its intention to repurchase up to million of its common stock from time to time 
funds for such purchases would be from borrowings under the credit facility 
in  the company entered into a million  five year working capital line of credit with a syndicate of banks 
the company had million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at january  in  the company also entered into a five year million lease financing facility to finance new stores and other property through operating leases 
the lease facility provides financing to lessors through loans from a third party lender for up to of a project cost 
lessors generally will make equity contributions approximating of each project 
independent of its obligations as lessee  the company guarantees payment when due of all amounts required to be paid to the third party lender 
the principal amount guaranteed is limited to approximately of the original cost of a project  so long as the company is not in default under the lease relating to such project 
there were properties financed through the lease facility  with a financed value of million at january  management believes that the rental payments for properties financed through the lease facility may be lower than those which the company could obtain elsewhere due to  among other factors  i the lower borrowing rates available to the company s landlords under the facility  and ii the fact that rental payments for properties financed through the facility do not include amortization of the principal amounts of the landlords indebtedness related to the properties 
rental payments relating to such properties will be adjusted when permanent financing is obtained to reflect the interest rates available at the time of the refinancing and the amortization of principal 
during  the company entered into agreements in which leases with respect to four borders locations serve as collateral for certain mortgage pass thru certificates 
these mortgage pass thru certificates include a provision requiring the company to repurchase the underlying mortgage notes in certain events  including the failure by the company to make payments of rent under the related leases  the failure by kmart to maintain required investment grade ratings or the termination of the guarantee by kmart of the company s obligations under the related leases which would require mutual consent of kmart and borders 
in the event the company is required to repurchase all of the underlying mortgage notes  the company would be obligated to pay approximately million 
the company would expect to fund this obligation through its line of credit 
since february  kmart has failed to maintain investment grade ratings and  therefore  these notes are now subject to put by the holder 
to date  the holder has not exercised its right to put the notes 
in addition to the contingent repurchase obligations described above  leases relating to two other borders locations served as collateral for certain mortgage pass thru certificates 
on march   kmart was required to repurchase the underlying notes 
the company purchased the notes from kmart for approximately on june   which fully satisfied the company s contingent obligation 
the company does not believe that the note purchase has had a material effect on the company s financial position or earnings 
accounting changes goodwill writedown prior to completion of the ipo  the company  as a subsidiary of kmart  followed the accounting policies established by kmart for its consolidated group and  accordingly  evaluated the overall recoverability of goodwill using projected undiscounted cash flows 
at april   such goodwill aggregated million  net of accumulated amortization of million 
the sale of common stock in the ipo generated net proceeds that were less than the historical book value of the company  resulting in kmart taking a write off of its investment in the company in the amount of million 
as a result  the company re evaluated its accounting policy regarding goodwill impairment and adopted a new policy for recognition and measurement of goodwill impairment based on a fair value approach 
the company believes fair value is a preferable method to assess goodwill as it believes that the value at which the individual businesses could be bought and sold in an arm s length transaction between a willing buyer and seller is the most objective evidence and  therefore  the most relevant measure of their value 
this change in the method of evaluating the recoverability of goodwill resulted in the recording of a pre tax charge to operations of million in the second quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the company took an additional charge of million 
the charges aggregated million for borders  million for planet music and million for waldenbooks 
as of january   all goodwill relating to waldenbooks and planet music had been written off 
this change resulted in a reduction of million and million of goodwill amortization expense on an annual and quarterly basis  respectively 
earnings per share in and prospectively will be improved by approximately on an annual basis 
in  the partial year effect of the accounting change excluding the one time charge was million  or approximately per share 
the company s fair value methodology is applied to each of its businesses on a separate basis 
when evaluating the need to record a goodwill impairment  the company will evaluate whether there have been any temporary or permanent impairments  and will record appropriate charges if any to operations for permanent impairments in fair value 
the company will evaluate borders for impairment every quarter 
since all goodwill related to the walden and planet businesses has been written off  no further evaluations for impairment will be necessary 
there was no goodwill impairment required in fas no 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas the company adopted fas  effective as of the fourth quarter of the carrying value of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets will be evaluated whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in performing such reviews for recoverability  the company compares the expected cash flows to the carrying value of long lived assets and identifiable intangibles 
if the expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and their estimated fair value 
fair value is estimated using expected future cash flows 
if an asset being tested for recoverability was acquired in a business combination accounted for using the purchase method  the goodwill that arose in that transaction is allocated to the assets being tested for recoverability 
this change resulted in a pre tax charge of million to operations in the fourth quarter of the charge consisted of million for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures of waldenbook stores  million for goodwill relating to such stores and million for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures of planet music 
the impairment relating to waldenbooks resulted principally from declining mall traffic and increasing superstore competition 
planet music also faces intense competition from superstores  resulting in declining gross margins 
as a result of this charge  depreciation and amortization expense was reduced by approximately million after tax or per share including the effects of the fourth quarter goodwill writedown previously discussed in and on a declining basis for the next several years 
no writedowns of long lived assets were required in restructuring plan in  the company implemented a restructuring plan to close underperforming walden stores and to combine certain distribution and headquarters functions of borders and walden  and recorded a provision of million to provide for the estimated costs of implementing the plan 
the restructuring provision included provisions for store closures of million  combination of certain borders and walden functions of million and reengineering programs of million 
as of january   the combination of operations and the store closure program was substantially complete 
walden continues to evaluate the operating performance of its stores and intends to aggressively identify stores which do not meet its performance and return criteria 
based upon this ongoing evaluation  the company may identify additional stores which it decides to close in future periods 
seasonality the company s business is highly seasonal  with sales significantly higher and all operating profit realized during the fourth quarter  which includes the christmas selling season
