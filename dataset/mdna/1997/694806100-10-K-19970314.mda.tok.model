item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations sales vs 
the company reported sales of million for  up million  or  from million in the electrical equipment segment accounted for million of these sales  while the safety equipment segment accounted for million 
of the million increase in total sales  million came from safety equipment and million came from electrical equipment 
sales of electric motors and controls represent nearly half of the company s total sales 
important markets for motors and controls are the manufacturers of equipment used in semiconductor fabrication  electronic assembly and plastic molding and extrusion 
in  these markets did not grow at their past rates 
the resulting reduction in the company s sales to these markets could not be fully offset by growth in other motor and control markets 
in total  sales of motors and controls in were down from the company s instruments group manufactures equipment for detecting and measuring particles in liquids  vacuums  solids and gases 
within this group  the high yield technology hyt operation sells mainly to semiconductor manufacturers 
with a leveling of demand for semiconductors in  many of these customers deferred the purchase of hyt equipment 
hyt sales were down from this reduction in sales at hyt was greater than the gain in sales recorded by the hiac royco and met one operations 
in total  the instruments business was down from the prior year 
the decrease in sales of the instruments business includes the effect of hiac royco divesting its line of products for monitoring drinking water in early  as required by the us department of justice 
the divestiture was required as a condition for the company s acquisition of met one on december  sales by the fisher pierce and royce thompson operations  which serve the electric utility industry  increased in most of the improvement came in sales of outdoor lighting controls 
the company believes this increase is attributable to customers recognition that the company has upgraded its product offering 
sales of products that improve the efficiency of electric power distribution also increased 
the solium operation had sales of million in as compared to million sales in in july of  solium discontinued sales efforts on its then current versions of wire in ballasts and continued to sell its line of screw in adapters 
the reengineered wire in products were reintroduced to the market in early the level of demand for solium s ballasts is yet to be determined 
sales by the safety equipment segment were up over the prior year 
the sales increase was broadly spread across the product lines  with growth occurring in commercial  military and space applications 
the increased demand for commercial aircraft and increased profitability in the airline business helped to increase the sales of the safety equipment segment 
sales vs 
the company reported sales of million for  up million  or  from million in the electrical equipment segment accounted for million of sales  while the safety equipment segment accounted for million 
of the million increase in sales  million came from acquisitions which occurred in and  and which were accounted for as purchases 
without these acquisitions  sales would have been up 
sales in the electrical equipment segment were up in  and sales in the safety equipment segment were approximately equal to those of the prior year 
combined and separate results for pacific scientific and met one  during the periods preceding the merger  are shown in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements

the backlog of orders for electrical equipment products increased between and the backlog for safety equipment products declined by approximately million  although this reduction does not necessarily indicate lower sales in gross margins gross profit margins  as a percentage of sales  are as follows for the past three years gross profit margin the point decline in gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to events within the motor and control area and at solium 
the motor and control area accounted for about of the points decline 
the contributing factors were a decline in sales volume  reorganization of the powertec product line  price pressure on electronic drives and a decline in margins at the bautz operation 
in  the mix of sales at bautz resulted in a lower gross margin when compared with the prior year 
manufacturing start up expenses associated with the solium operation reduced gross margins by approximately percentage point 
the rest of the decline in gross margin stemmed from the instruments group and the safety equipment segment  where there were small decreases 
these decreases were partially offset by increase in gross margins at the fisher pierce operation 
selling and marketing expense selling and marketing expenses  as a percentage of sales  are as follows for the past three years selling and marketing expense the percentage of selling and marketing expenses increased slightly in over considerable marketing expense was associated with the start up of solium

research and development expense research and development expenses  as a percentage of sales  are as follows for the past three years research and development expense research and development expense amounted to of sales in the electrical equipment segment and of sales in the safety equipment segment 
the ratio of r d expense to sales is believed to be at the high end of the range for this expense at similar companies for similar product lines 
there are no assurances that the company s r d efforts will significantly increase future sales 
revenues from r d efforts funded by others are included in net sales in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and the related expenses are included in cost of sales 
restructuring and other charges the company s results reflect a charge of million after taxes  million relating to solium restructuring and other related charges 
the restructuring plan was based on the recognition that the solium subsidiary was addressing too many different markets and was preparing for high volume production too quickly 
the objective of the restructuring was to limit the ballast product line to compact fluorescent lamp applications  the fastest growing part of the market 
all work on ballasts for linear fluorescent lamps was discontinued 
the company s success with the reintroduced product line cannot be projected at this time reference is made to risks described at the end of item  management s discussion and analysis 
following is a schedule of costs included in the solium restructuring and other charges in millions reduction in inventory valuation asset write down restructuring expense  including terminations other expenses total restructuring and other charges of the total restructuring and other charges  approximately million resulted in cash payments  during interest expense net interest expense for the past three years is as follows in millions net interest expense short and long term bank borrowings increased million in to million

income before income taxes income before income taxes has been as follows for the past three years in millions income before income taxes the million reduction in income before taxes between and can be accounted for as follows in millions difference solium operating loss restructuring and other charges total electrical equipment safety equipment interest and other total the million increase in solium operating losses was the result of addressing too many different florescent ballast markets  preparing for high volume production too quickly and not realizing the sales growth expected 
the restructuring charge has been explained previously 
the million reduction in operating income for the electrical equipment segment was mainly the result of lower earnings in the motor and control business 
operating income for this business declined to of sales in from in reduced sales and nonrecurring reorganization expenses in the powertec operation including employee termination pay lowered powertec s operating income by nearly million 
approximately million reduction in operating income occurred at the bautz operation 
however  bautz remained solidly profitable  with an operating margin of 
finally  reduced sales to the semiconductor capital goods market  declining prices for electronic products  and delays in releasing some new motor and electronic products further reduced operating income of the motor and control business 
operating income of the instruments group was approximately million less in than in due to reduced sales by the hyt unit 
operating income of the fisher pierce operation improved between and by nearly million 
operating income in the safety equipment segment was approximately equal to the prior year  despite higher sales volume due to lower gross margins 
the effective income tax rate  as a percentage of pretax income  is as follows for the past three years effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate increased in because a larger share of the company s total earnings came from its german operation which has a higher effective tax rate 
amortization expense of other assets  which is not tax deductible  became more significant due to the lower level of earnings in in addition  the effective income tax rate had been favorably impacted by the utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards in germany 
the internal revenue service has completed its examination of the company s federal returns for the years  and no material adjustments resulted from this examination 
the only open years for irs examination are now and the company estimates that its effective tax rate in to be approximately reference is made to risks described at the end of item  management s discussion and analysis 
net income net income  as a percentage of sales  is as follows for the past three years net income equivalent shares outstanding for earnings per share calculations  the average common and common equivalent shares outstanding for the past three years are as follows primary earnings    fully diluted earnings    the change in the number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding is due to the exercise of stock options and the dilutive effect of stock options granted but not exercised 
the calculation of this number is based on the average price of the company s common stock traded on the new york stock exchange throughout each year 
the fully diluted earnings per share reflect the maximum extent of dilution resulting from outstanding stock options  based on the closing price of the company s common stock at the end of each year 
the number of fully diluted shares was larger in than in and primarily because of the assumed conversion of the company s outstanding convertible debentures 
the convertible debentures were dilutive in but antidilutive in and employees pacific scientific had  employees at the end of over the past three years  sales per employee based on the average number of employees  including part time employees have been as follows sales per employee    contributing to the reduction in sales per employee were the reorganization of the powertec operation including relocation of a product line and the unexpected drop in sales at hyt
