item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the company s results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
general the company operates itt technical institutes in states which provide career oriented postsecondary education to more than  students 
the company derives its revenue almost entirely from tuition  textbook sales  fees and charges paid by  or on behalf of  its students 
most students at the itt technical institutes rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  especially the federal student financial aid programs under title iv of the higher education act of  as amended title iv programs  to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
a substantial majority of the company s revenue is indirectly derived from title iv programs 
the company s revenue varies based on the aggregate student population  which is influenced by the number of students attending itt technical institutes at the beginning of a fiscal period  by the number of new first time students entering and former students re entering itt technical institutes during such period and by student retention rates 
new students primarily enter itt technical institutes at the beginning of each academic quarter that commences in march  june  september and december 
the company believes the size of its student population is affected to some extent by general economic conditions  and that  in the absence of countervailing factors  student enrollments and retention rates would tend to increase as opportunities for immediate employment for high school graduates decline and decrease as such opportunities increase 
the establishment of new itt technical institutes and the introduction of additional program offerings at existing itt technical institutes have been significant factors in increasing the aggregate student population in recent years 
a new technical institute must be authorized by the state in which it will operate  accredited by an accrediting commission that has been recognized by the us department of education  and certified by the us department of education to participate in title iv programs 
the approval processes for accreditation and federal certification cannot commence until the first students begin classes 
such authorization  accreditation and approval processes take approximately one year from the first class start date 
certain direct costs incurred with respect to a new technical institute prior to the first class start institute start up costs are deferred and amortized over the first year of operation after the first class start 
since  the company has opened new technical institutes five of which started classes in or 
new technical institutes historically incur a loss during the month period after the first class start date 
these losses during the year by institutes in their first two years of operation  together with the amortization of institute start up costs  are referred to as operating losses from new technical institutes 
such operating losses from new technical institutes totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company earns tuition revenue on a weekly basis  pro rata over the length of each of four  twelve week academic quarters in each fiscal year 
under federal and state regulations and accrediting commission standards  the company generally is required to refund a portion of the tuition payments received from a student who withdraws from an itt technical institute during an academic quarter 
the amount of tuition  if any  that may be retained by the company after payment of any potential refund is immediately recognized in the company s statement of income 
other educational revenue is comprised of textbook sales and lab and enrollment fees 
the company incurs expenses throughout a fiscal period in connection with the operation of the itt technical institutes 
the cost of educational services includes faculty and administrative salaries  cost of books sold  occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization of equipment costs and leasehold improvements and certain other administrative costs incurred by the itt technical institutes 
student services and administrative expenses during any fiscal period include direct marketing costs which are marketing expenses directly related to new student recruitment  indirect marketing expenses incurred during the period  an allowance for doubtful accounts and administrative expenses incurred at corporate headquarters 
direct marketing costs include salaries and employee benefits for recruiting representatives and direct solicitation advertising expenses 
direct marketing costs  excluding advertising expenses  are capitalized and amortized on an accelerated basis over the average course length of months commencing on the class start date 
marketing costs that do not relate to the direct solicitation of potential students are expensed as incurred 
all cash receipts of the company are forwarded to itt corporation itt for investment on a daily basis after  in the case of certain receipts  the lapse of applicable regulatory restrictions 
cash disbursements of the company are generally funded by itt out of the cash balances of the company held and invested for the company by itt 
net interest income represents principally interest paid or received from itt and miscellaneous interest paid or received from other parties 
commencing in  itt pays the company interest on the full amount of any net cash balances invested for the company by itt at an interest rate that is set for a six or twelve month period and is basis points over the most recently published rate for six or twelve month treasury bills  as appropriate  and no longer assesses interest charges on the company except with respect to funds actually advanced to the company in excess of cash invested with itt 
itt performs a number of other services for the company  including the administration of certain employee benefit plans  for which it receives compensation from the company 
variations in quarterly results of operations the company s quarterly results of operations tend to fluctuate significantly within a fiscal year because of differences in the number of weeks of earned tuition revenue in each fiscal quarter and the timing of student matriculations 
the company s first and third fiscal quarters have weeks of earned tuition revenue  while the second and fourth quarters have only weeks of earned tuition revenue because of two week vacation breaks in june and december 
in addition  revenue in the third and fourth fiscal quarters generally benefits from increased student matriculations as the number of new students entering itt technical institutes tends to be substantially higher in june of all new students in and september of all new students in because of the significant number of recent high school graduates entering itt technical institutes for the academic quarters beginning in those two months 
the company s incurrence of costs  however  is generally not affected by the academic schedule  and such costs do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
the following table sets forth the company s revenue in each quarter during the three prior fiscal years

revenue increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to a increase in the number of new first time students commencing their attendance at itt technical institutes  in compared to  in  a increase in tuition rates in september and  and the opening of new institutes two in september  two in march and one in september 
the number of students attending itt technical institutes at january  was approximately the same as at january  student retention rates did not change materially in the two years 
the three new itt technical institutes beginning classes in accounted for new students 
cost of educational services 
cost of educational services increased by million  or  to million in from million in principally as a result of increased costs related to the introduction of additional programs  an increase in salaries and occupancy costs at itt technical institutes opened prior to  costs at the six new institutes opened in  costs at the two new institutes opened in  costs at the three new institutes opened in  and  to a lesser extent  as a result of an increase in the costs of books sold related to the increased student population 
provisions for legal expenses increased by million in from levels 
this increase was principally a result of a million provision in million in fourth quarter and million in third quarter for the legal actions in eldredge  et al 
v 
itt educational services  inc  et al 
the eldredge case see note of notes to financial statements for a further description 
cost of educational services decreased to of revenues in  as compared to in  primarily because of greater revenues being spread over the fixed portion of cost of educational services 
student services and administrative expenses 
student services and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in principally as a result of a million increase in marketing costs 
this increase is due to i an increase in the marketing costs for the six new technical institutes opened in and the two new technical institutes opened in  ii the commencement of marketing costs for the three new technical institutes opened in and iii the increased marketing costs for itt technical institutes opened prior to administrative expenses at the corporate headquarters increased by million in from levels primarily due to increased headquarters staff 
the provision for doubtful accounts in was approximately million more than in principally because of increased revenue and a delay in the us department of education s certification of the new institutes opened in and to participate in the title iv programs eg  the delay resulted in a greater number of students who withdrew or were terminated from the institutes before they could secure federal student financial aid with which they could pay their obligations to the company 
student services and administrative expenses increased to of revenues in as compared to in  because of increased television advertising 
interest income 
interest income decreased by million in because of the reduction in the interest rate earned on the cash invested by the company with itt ie  in compared to in

revenue increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in the number of students at itt technical institutes  a increase in tuition rates in december and the opening of new institutes four in june  two in december and two in september 
the growth in student population was attributable to a increase in the number of students attending itt technical institutes at january  as compared with january   offset by a decrease in the number of new students entering itt technical institutes in as compared to student retention rates did not change materially in the two years 
the number of new  first time students at itt technical institutes decreased from  in to  in the two new itt technical institutes beginning classes in accounted for new students

cost of educational services decreased to of revenues in  as compared to in  primarily because of the million decrease in pension expenses the discount rate for computing pension expense increased from in to in 
excluding the cost of educational services and revenues for new institutes ie  institutes in their first months of operation after their first class start  cost of educational services would have been of revenues in compared to in student services and administrative expenses 
student services and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in principally as a result of a million increase in marketing costs 
this increase is due to i an increase in the marketing costs for the five new technical institutes opened in and the six new technical institutes opened in  ii the commencement of marketing costs for the two new technical institutes opened in and iii the increased marketing costs for itt technical institutes opened prior to administrative expenses at the corporate headquarters increased by million in from levels primarily due to increased headquarters staff

this cash earned on the daily outstanding balance during net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for from million for  due to the increase in operating income million after tax and the million increase in the after tax interest income 
liquidity and capital resources a substantial majority of the company s revenue is derived from title iv programs 
federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements of funds under title iv programs 
students must apply for a new loan for each academic year three academic quarters 
loan funds are generally provided by lenders in two disbursements for each academic year 
the first disbursement is usually received either days after in the case of students commencing a program of study or days before the start of the first academic quarter of a student s academic year  and the second disbursement is typically received days before the start of the second academic quarter of a student s academic year 
while the timing of loan disbursements to the company is subject to a student s directions to the lender and to existing regulatory requirements regarding such disbursements  which last changed effective july   the company has typically received student loan funds upon their disbursement by the lender 
the us department of education issued final regulations on november  detailing new rules and procedures under which an institution participating in title iv programs requests  maintains  disburses and otherwise manages title iv program funds 
these new fund management regulations are effective july  and will require the company to receive its funds in three equal quarterly disbursements rather than the two disbursements currently permitted  as described above 
the company estimates that this change will decrease net cash provided by operating activities a one time effect by approximately to million  and will decrease interest income an on going effect by to million 
the principal uses of cash are to pay salaries  occupancy and equipment costs  recruiting and marketing expenses  administrative expenses and taxes 
cash receipts of the company are forwarded to itt on a daily basis  and cash disbursements of the company are generally funded by itt out of the cash balances of the company invested with itt 
the company s net cash balances of the cash invested with itt increased from million at december  to million at december  and ranged from a low of million in may  to a high of million in december  so long as itt continues to own at least of the company s outstanding common stock  the company will be able to continue participating in an itt intercompany cash management system and will be able to obtain advances from itt for general corporate purposes in amounts in excess of any cash invested with itt up to a maximum of million 
the company has generated positive cash flows from operations for the past five years 
cash flows from operations increased by million in to million from million in this increase is primarily due to the increases in operating income and deferred tuition revenue resulting from the increased student enrollment 
cash flows from operations in was million  a decrease of million from million in this decrease is primarily due to the one time increase in receipt of funds in from the expansion of electronic receipt of student financial aid 
at december   the company had positive working capital of million 
deferred tuition revenue  which represents the unrecognized portion of tuition revenue received from students  was million at december  an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all title iv programs if student defaults on federal student loans exceed certain rates 
these rates are calculated on an institutional basis  defined as a main campus and all of its additional locations 
under the federal family education loan ffel programs  any institution whose cohort default rate on loans made under the federal stafford loan and federal supplemental loans for students programs is or greater for three consecutive years will no longer be eligible to participate in any of the ffel programs including the federal plus program or the federal direct student loan fdsl program for the remainder of the federal fiscal year in which the us department of education determines that the institution has lost its eligibility and for the two subsequent federal fiscal years  unless the institution successfully challenges such disqualification 
during the pendency of any such appeal  the institution retains its eligibility to participate in the applicable loan programs 
no itt technical institute campus group has an ffel cohort default rate equal to or greater than for three consecutive federal fiscal years 
three itt technical institute campus groups  consisting of three institutes located in houston west  garland and san antonio  texas  have ffel cohort default rates for the and federal fiscal years which exceed 
with respect to the and ffel cohort default rates  each of these institutes has submitted the appropriate appeals and requests for adjustment based on i improper loan servicing and or collection of certain student loans included in the calculation of these rates and ii erroneous data used to calculate such rates 
the us department of education has since denied each of the garland  houston west and san antonio itt technical institute s appeal of its official ffel cohort default rate based on improper loan servicing and or collection 
these institutes have each taken steps to reduce their ffel cohort default rates for the and subsequent federal fiscal years 
loss of eligibility to participate in the ffel and fdsl programs by either the houston west  garland or san antonio  texas itt technical institutes could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  because they accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in the company s fiscal year 
on january   hilton hotels corporation hilton commenced a tender offer for approximately of the outstanding shares of itt s common stock the hilton offer 
hilton has announced that  if its offer succeeds  it will obtain the entire equity interest in itt by merging itt with hilton or a subsidiary of hilton such merger  together with the hilton offer  the hilton transaction 
the hilton transaction is more fully described in the tender offer statement on schedule d filed by hilton with the securities and exchange commission the hilton d hilton has stated in the hilton d that it may be required to obtain approvals from or make filings with certain regulatory bodies governing the company in connection with the hilton transaction 
the company believes that the hilton transaction would  if successful  constitute a change in ownership resulting in a change in control of the company under the regulations of the us department of education  all or virtually all of the state education authorities that regulate the company s business the states and the accrediting commissions that accredit each itt technical institute the accrediting commissions 
upon a change in control of the company under us department of education regulations  the itt technical institutes would immediately become ineligible to participate in title iv programs and their students would be unable to obtain title iv program funds to pay their cost of education until such time as the us department of education recertifies the itt technical institutes to participate in title iv programs 
the us department of education will not preapprove a change in control and will only reinstate an institution s eligibility to participate in title iv programs upon approval of a proper application following the institution s change in control 
to be proper  among other things  such application must demonstrate that the relevant itt technical institute is authorized by the appropriate states and accredited by the appropriate accrediting commission 
therefore  before each itt technical institute may regain access to title iv program funds following a change in control a it must be reaccredited or continue to be accredited by the appropriate accrediting commission and reauthorized or continue to be authorized by the appropriate states and b the change in control must otherwise be approved by the us department of education 
the accrediting commissions will not reaccredit an itt technical institute unless that institute is authorized by the appropriate states 
the standards of the accrediting commission which accredits itt technical institutes provide that  during the days immediately preceding the change in control  the accrediting commission will determine whether to continue the institution s accreditation for a period of six months after the change in control to allow the institution to obtain reauthorization or confirmation of continued authorization by the appropriate states and apply for reaccreditation 
the standards of the accrediting commission which accredits three itt technical institutes provide that  within five business days after an institution obtains reauthorization or confirmation of continued authorization by the appropriate states following a change in control  the accrediting commission will determine whether to temporarily reinstate the institution s accreditation during the period in which the institution must apply for permanent reinstatement of its accreditation 
most states  including california  require that a change in control of an institution be approved before it occurs in order for the institution to maintain its authorization the prior approval states 
some states will only review a change in control of an institution after it occurs the post approval states 
the company estimates that it could take up to a six months prior to a change in control of the itt technical institutes to obtain approval from all of the prior approval states  b six months following a change in control of the itt technical institutes to obtain approval from all of the post approval states  and c an additional six months after the institute is reauthorized or continues to be authorized by the appropriate states and reaccredited or continues to be accredited by the appropriate accrediting commission for each itt technical institute to be recertified by the us department of education and  thereby  regain its eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
therefore  the company estimates that eligibility to participate in title iv programs may not be regained by an itt technical institute located in i a prior approval state for up to six months following a change in control  and ii a post approval state for up to months or  if state reauthorization is not required  for up to six months following a change in control 
notwithstanding the foregoing  a california statute prohibits the approval of a change in control of any institution that has been found to have violated chapter of the california education code chapter in any judicial or administrative proceeding 
in october  the jury in the eldredge case determined that the itt technical institute in san diego  california violated chapter see year ended december  compared with year ended december  cost of educational services and note of notes to financial statements 
the company has appealed the jury s verdict in the eldredge case  but it is highly unlikely that california would approve a change in control of the san diego itt technical institute unless and until a the company s appeal is successful  b it is determined that the jury s verdict does not constitute a finding in a judicial proceeding until all of the company s appeals are exhausted or otherwise  or c the california statute imposing the restriction is changed or determined to be unenforceable 
in addition to the eldredge case  five legal actions are pending against the company alleging violations of chapter by the san diego itt technical institute and one legal action is pending against the company alleging violations of chapter by all ten of the itt technical institutes in california 
a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would result if a change in control of the company occurred a without the prior approvals of the prior approval states and in particular  california  b without the continued or temporarily reinstated accreditation of the accrediting commissions  or c after the prior approvals of the prior approval states and the continued or temporarily reinstated accreditation of the accrediting commissions  if a material number of itt technical institutes failed to timely i obtain the requisite reauthorizations from the post approval states or ii regain eligibility to participate in title iv programs from the us department of education 
in addition  the time of year at which a change in control of the company occurs coupled with the length of time required by the itt technical institutes to regain their eligibility to participate in title iv programs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations and the amount of title iv program funds students can obtain to pay the education costs of attending the itt technical institutes 
itt has stated in the solicitation recommendation statement on schedule d filed by itt with the securities and exchange commission the itt d in response to the hilton offer that it is actively exploring opportunities to enhance the value of itt 
as part of this process  itt has disclosed in the itt d that it is taking steps to monetize or otherwise realize the value of non core assets 
itt has disclosed that as a result  it is exploring possible transactions to dispose of some or all of the common stock of the company held by itt 
there can be no assurance that itt will maintain its ownership interest in the company 
the company believes that  if itt were to decide to dispose of its ownership interest in the company  certain types of transactions by which itt could dispose of such ownership interest might not result in a change in control of the company under us department of education regulations  however  if the means of disposition chosen by itt result in such a change in control  such change in control could have the material adverse consequences for the company described above 
the company s capital assets consist primarily of classroom and laboratory equipment such as computers  electronic equipment and robotic systems  classroom and office furniture and leasehold improvements 
all building facilities are leased 
capital expenditures totaled million during and included expenditures of million for new technical institutes  million to expand curricula offerings at existing institutes  million to replace or add furniture or equipment at existing institutes  and million on leasehold improvements 
leasehold improvements represent part of a continuing effort by the company to maintain its existing facilities in excellent condition 
capital expenditures decreased by million to million in from million in  principally due to the decreased number of new institutes in and institutes compared to and institutes 
new institutes have large capital additions in the first two years 
capital expenditures for of million were million more than the million of capital expenditures in  principally due to the increased expansion of curricula offerings at existing institutes 
to date  cash generated from operations has been sufficient to meet capital expenditures 
the company plans to continue to upgrade and expand current facilities and equipment 
the company has purchased new software for its computer aided drafting technology program which will require the expenditure of approximately million to acquire new computers in the first quarter of the company expects that the capital expenditures  including these computers  will be approximately million 
the capital additions for a new institute are approximately million and the capital expenditures for new curricula at an existing institute are approximately million 
the company anticipates that its planned capital additions can be funded from cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operations on a long term basis is highly dependent upon the receipt of funds from federal financial aid program and the amount of funds spent on new institutes  curricula additions at existing institutes and possible acquistions 
factors that may affect future results this report contains certain forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following business conditions and growth in the postsecondary education industry and in the general economy  changes in federal and state governmental regulations with respect to education and accreditation standards  or the interpretation or enforcement thereof  including  but not limited to  the level of government funding for  and the company s eligibility to participate in  student financial aid programs utilized by the company s students  the results of the company s appeal in eldredge  et al 
v 
itt educational services  inc  et al 
and the results of any related litigation  effects of any change in ownership of the company resulting in a change in control of the company  including  but not limited to  the consequences of such changes on the accreditation and federal and state regulation of the institutes  receptivity of students and employers to the company s existing program offerings and new curricula  loss of lender access to the company s students for student loans  and a substantial increase in the shares of common stock available for sale in the market if itt divests some or all of its common stock holdings
