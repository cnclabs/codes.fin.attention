item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company participates in floor plan arrangements with several major third party lenders on behalf of its dealers  most of whom have financing arrangements with more than one lender 
except as described above or where it has a direct repurchase agreement with a dealer  the company is under no material obligation to repurchase boats from its dealers 
from time to time the company will voluntarily repurchase a boat for the convenience of the dealer or for another dealer who needs a particular model not readily available from the factory 
the marketing of boats to retail customers is primarily the responsibility of the dealer  whose efforts are supplemented by the company through advertising in boating magazines and participation in regional  national  and international boat shows 
additionally  in order to further promote its products  the company developed a racing program 
this entailed the construction of specially designed race boats which have been entered in major national offshore boat races 
fountain race boats won many major races 
additionally  fountain single  twin and triple engine racing boats currently own world speed records 
the result of this record of victories and speed records by a major manufacturer is that the company s products won a reputation for very fast and safe hull design  durable construction  and mechanical reliability 
the company believes that the favorable publicity generated by its record setting and winning race boats has contributed significantly to its sales volume 
although the company curtailed its racing program for fiscal and sold all of its race boats  the fact that its racing program was so successful in fiscal and fiscal has  the company believes  significantly benefited its sales volume in subsequent years 
from fiscal through fiscal  the company had limited its participation in racing to partial support of customer owned and driven fountain race boats 
also  the company founder and ceo  reggie fountain  has raced a limited schedule since  and won numerous races in both factory and customer boats  he has also set numerous speed records in both factory and customer boats 
these fountain race boats were  in general  very successful in the various racing circuits in which they competed 
the company commenced construction of two race boats during fiscal and intends to again implement a racing program during fiscal as part of the marketing program for its new line of sport fishing boats  the company sponsored several outstanding sport fishermen in the southern kingfish association s king mackerel tournaments 
this competitive circuit is held throughout the southeast 
in fiscal  the company s boats and sponsored fishermen dominated the tournaments by winning four of the top five spots 
one fountain fisherman  clayton kirby  was named angler of the year and finished in first place 
again  in fiscal  first place was taken by a fountain fisherman 
fountain fishermen also won second place and of the top spots in fiscal since fiscal  the fountain fishing team has continued to place high in the final standings winning five of the last seven ska world championships 
the southern kingfish association s tournaments are held weekly and attract from one hundred to one thousand entrants with prizes ranging up to  the winning participation by fountain sport fishing boats has given them favorable exposure to serious sport fishermen  in particular with respect to the superior performance of fountain s fishing boat line 
sales order backlog 
the sales order backlog as of the end of september was for approximately boats having an estimated sales value of  this compares to an equivalent backlog at this time in september  and september  during the last two years the company s lower priced fishing boat lines have led sales increases holding down the average unit price 
later this year  with the formal introduction of the new  and models which have not been included in backlog numbers  the company believes that its average unit price and margins will increase significantly 
the company s fall dealer allocation program is designed to promote early replenishment of the stock in dealer inventories depleted throughout the spring and summer 
product warranty 
the company warrants the deck and hull of its boats against defects in material and workmanship for a period of three years 
engines included in the boats are warrantied by the engine manufacturer 
warranty expenses of  were incurred in fiscal and were charged off against net income 
a reserve for warranty expenses estimated to be incurred in future years had been recorded and amounted to  at june  for  warranty costs were only six tenths of one percent 
warranty cost as a percentage of sales are among the lowest in the marine industry thereby reflecting the company s superior construction of its boats 
competition 
competition within the power boat manufacturing industry is intense 
while the high performance sports boat market comprises only a small segment of all boats manufactured  the higher prices commanded by these boats make it a significant market in terms of total dollars spent 
the manufacturers that compete directly with the company in its market segment include wellcraft division of genmar industries  inc formula  a division of thunderbird products corporation cigarette racing team  inc baja boats  inc the company believes that in its market segment  speed  performance  quality  image  and safety are the main competitive factors  with styling and price being somewhat lesser considerations 
their market for fishing boats is much larger than the one for sport boats  but there are many more fishing boat manufacturers than there are sport boat manufacturers 
with its winning image  fountain will always sell its projected budget 
for high performance surface drive super ventilated positive lift wide beam cruisers  we believe there is a ready market waiting for our products 
it is our belief that there are no competitors that can match us in this highly profitable area

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as described more fully below at business environment  approximately half of the company s shipments to dealers were financed through so called floor plan arrangements with third party lenders pursuant to which the company may be required to repurchase boats repossessed by the lenders if the dealers defaults under his credit arrangement 
the other half of shipments were cod or payment prior to shipment 
generally  the company recognizes a sale when a boat is shipped to a customer  legal title and all other incidents of ownership have passed from the company to the customer  and payment is received from the customers third party commercial lender or from the customer 
this is the method of sales recognition believed to be in use by most boat manufacturers 
the company has developed criteria for determining whether a shipment should be recorded as a sale or as a deferred sale a balance sheet liability 
the criteria for recording a sale are that the boat has been completed and shipped to a customer  that title and all other incidents of ownership have passed to the customer  and that there is no direct commitment to repurchase the boat or to pay floor plan interest beyond the normal sales program terms 
at june   the company estimated the balances in deferred sales to be  and in deferred cost of sales to be  at june   the company estimated the balances in deferred sales to be  and in deferred cost of sales to be  the differences between the estimates for deferred sales and deferred cost of sales at june  and june  had the effect of increasing the gross margin on sales and net income after taxes for the year by  
per share 
at june  and  there were no commitments to dealers to pay the interest on floor plan financed boats in excess of the time period specified in the company s written sales program and there were no direct repurchase agreements 
this was because of much improved market conditions and strong ongoing consumer demand for boats 
therefore  there were no deferred sales or cost of sales estimated at june   and the differences between the estimates for deferred sales and deferred cost of sales at june  and june  had the effect of increasing the gross margin on sales and net income after taxes for the year by  there was no such effect on fiscal the company has a contingent liability to repurchase boats where it participates in the floor plan financing made available to its dealers by third party finance companies 
sales to participating dealers are approved by the respective finance companies 
if a participating dealer does not satisfy its obligation to the lender and the boat is subsequently repossessed by the lender  then the company can be required to repurchase the boat 
the company had a contingent liability of approximately  at june    at june  and  at june  for the shipment of boats which remained uncollected by the finance companies at those dates 
the lesser contingent liability at june  is due to fewer boats being floor planned by dealers with finance companies 
additionally  at june  and june  the company had recorded a  and  reserve for losses which may be reasonably expected to be incurred on boat repurchases in future years 
business environment 
the company s sales have continued to increase each year 
sales for were  a increase from sales for fiscal improved sales volume for fiscal was in line with a general improvements is the overall recreational boating industry and the result of additional production capacity 
also  the company continued its highly effective advertising and marketing programs throughout fiscal sales for fiscal were  a increase from sales for fiscal sales for fiscal were in fiscal  the company continued to advertise and market aggressively 
management believes that the company s advertising  marketing  racing  and tournament fishing programs  as well as  its reputation as the builder of the highest quality  best performing  and safest high performance boats in the industry  all contributed in increased sales for fiscal typically  each dealer s floor plan credit facilities are secured by the dealer s inventory  and  perhaps  the dealers letter of credit or other personal and real property 
in connection with the dealers floor plan arrangements  the company as well as substantially all other major manufacturers has agreed in most instances to repurchases  under certain circumstances  any of its boats which a lender repossesses from a dealer and returns to the company 
in the event that a dealer defaults under credit line  the lender may invoke the manufacturers repurchase agreements with respect to that dealer 
in that event  all repurchase agreements of all manufacturers supplying a defaulting dealer are generally invoked regardless of the boat or boats with respect to which the dealer has defaulted 
except where there is a direct repurchase agreement with the customer  the company is under no obligation to repurchase boats from its dealers  although it will on occasion voluntarily assist a dealer in selling a boat or repurchase a boat for the convenience of a dealer 
no boats were repurchased in fiscal  and fiscal in connection with floor plan arrangements 
five boats were repurchased during fiscal in connection with floor plan arrangements 
at june  and  the company had recorded a  and  reserve for losses which may be reasonably expected to be incurred on boat repurchases in future years 
results of operations 
net income for fiscal was  or 
per share outstanding 
this compares to net income for fiscal of  or 
per share 
the change in net income was due to a discontinued operations loss and write down of assets of a subsidiary  fountain power  inc for  see note and note 
income from continuing operations before the loss and writedown due to fountain power  inc  increased in fiscal to  or over fiscal income from continuing operations for fiscal was  the improvement in income from continuing operations for fiscal was the result of greater sales volume  price increases  production efficiencies  and a favorable sales mix 
the mix of sales continued to be weighted with sales of the company s larger  higher margin sport boats 
net income for fiscal was up due to an improvement in sales volume  production efficiencies and a favorable sales mix 
also  income was bolstered by inclusion of a non recurring  discount earned for the early retirement of indebtedness to a vendor 
sales were  for fiscal  or up by from the previous year 
net income for fiscal was up primarily because of substantially improved sales volume 
sales were   or up by from the previous year 
sales for fiscal were  the sales mix for fiscal was unfavorable and overall sales volume through february  was less than anticipated 
fewer boats were sold and they were generally smaller and less profitable resulting in a loss for the year 
in fiscal  at the miami boat show in mid february  the new positive lift hull design was introduced 
this new hull design significantly increases speed  improves handling  and results in much better fuel economy 
subsequent to the introduction of this new design  the company received many orders for large  profitable sport boats having the new positive lift hull 
as the company s sales order volume improved  it began to greatly increase its level of purchases of high performance engines and other critical components 
unfortunately  the high performance engines and certain other critical components were not available on a timely basis 
this caused serious and prolonged delays in the company s boat production 
many costly inefficiencies were incurred in its manufacturing operations as a consequence of not having the necessary high performance engines and components on a timely basis 
by july  most of these supply problems had been resolved 
most of the sales orders that were not completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal because of delayed deliveries of critical components were completed in the first quarter of fiscal the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to price increases and the sales mix of larger  higher margin sport boats 
greater sales volume  more integrated manufacturing operations and production efficiencies also contributed to an improved gross margin for fiscal depreciation expense was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal depreciation expense by asset category was as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal land improvements    buildings    molds plugs    machinery equipment    furniture fixtures    transportation equipment    total    the  decrease in depreciation expense for fiscal from fiscal is due to an excess of molds becoming fully depreciated over new molds commencing to be depreciated during the year 
those particular molds which are now fully depreciated are still in active service 
following is a schedule of the net fixed asset additions during fiscal and fiscal fiscal fiscal buildings   land and improvements  molds and plugs   construction in progress  machinery equipment

  total   selling expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the company continued to promote its products primarily by magazine advertising in fiscal advertising expense was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal these advertising expenditures increased the company s visibility in the recreational marine industry and promoted its boat sales 
management believes that advertising is necessary in order to maintain the company s sales volume and dealer base 
additionally  in an effort to further promote its products  the company continued its offshore racing and tournament fishing programs 
these programs cost  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal as previously noted  the company curtailed its offshore racing program in fiscal and sold its last remaining race boat  but continued a limited racing program and its tournament fishing program through fiscal the company commenced construction of two race boats during late fiscal and intends to again implement a racing program during fiscal selling expenses compared for the past three fiscal years were as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal offshore racing and tournament fishing    advertising    salaries commissions    boat shows 

   dealer incentives    other selling expenses    total    general and administrative expenses include the finance  accounting  legal  personnel  data processing  and administrative operating expenses of the company 
these expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal most of the increase for fiscal over fiscal was in executive compensation  travel expense  and attorneys fees 
interest expense was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the decrease in interest expense for fiscal is primarily from lower interest rates on long term debt 
no fixed assets were sold in fiscal during fiscal some trucks were sold yielding a gain of  during fiscal some miscellaneous fixed assets were sold yielding a loss amounting to  included in other income for fiscal are consulting fees earned by the use of mr

these consulting fees amounted to  for fiscal under the terms of the current consulting contract  the consulting fees ended entirely after fiscal liquidity and financial resources 
operations in fiscal provided  in cash 
net income plus depreciation expense provided cash amounting to  however  relatively large amounts were needed to finance investment activities in purchasing property  plant  equipment and molds 
the loss from operations of the discontinued subsidiaries  fountain power  inc and mach performance  inc

debt repayments to metlife capital corporation and other amounted to  the net increase in cash for fiscal was  for fiscal  the company anticipates that the  beginning cash balance and the amounts expected to be provided from operations will be sufficient to meet most of the company s liquidity needs of the year 
however  planned capital expenditures for fiscal are substantially greater than for fiscal the company intends to increase its production capacity  principally for new products  in fiscal therefore  the company is reviewing various financing alternatives to provide for its increased growth 
effective december   the company repaid its indebtedness to metlife capital corporation  deutsche financial services  and others with a new  long term loan agreement with general electric capital corporation  of which  was initially disbursed 
a second disbursement was made during the year for  bringing the total outstanding as of june  to  less scheduled monthly principal reductions 
effective december   the company refinanced its indebtedness to metlife capital corporation 
a  revolving loan was incorporated into the long term debt and the total amount was amortized over ten years with a call at the end of the fifth year 
the interest rate on the debt was fixed at 
the new monthly payment amounts very closely approximate what the principal and interest payment amounts were prior to the refinancing 
the indebtedness is secured by a first lien to the company s assets  except engines manufactured by mercury marine 
an additional  was borrowed in the transaction 
the total amount of the debt to metlife as december  was  after the refinancing 
the indebtedness to metlife was  at june  and  at june  the loan agreement with metlife was amended january   to revise certain financial ratio requirements that the company had previously not attained 
after the revision of the financial ratio requirements and at june  and  the company was in compliance with all of the metlife financial ratio requirements 
in june of  the ompany arranged for a line of credit from deutsche financial services for engine purchases 
at june  the amount owed to deutsche was  at june  the amount owed was  and at june  the amount owed was  the maximum amount of the line of credit from deutsche is  the debt is secured by a first lien on all engine inventory and by a  irrevocable letter of credit 
in december  the company borrowed  from g 
e 
capital corporation for the purpose of retiring its indebtedness to a vendor 
this debt to g 
e 
capital corporation is scheduled for repayment over forty months at interest 
it is secured by various boat molds and product tooling and by an irrevocable bank letter of credit for  the unpaid balance at june  was effects of inflation 
the company has not been materially affected by the moderate inflation of recent years 
since most of the company s plant and its equipment are relatively new  expenditures for replacements are not expected to be a factor in the near term future 
when raw material costs increase because of inflation  the company attempts to minimize the effect of these increases by using alternative  less costly materials  or by finding less costly sources for the materials it uses 
when the foregoing measures are not possible  its selling prices are increased to recover the cost increases 
the company s products are targeted at the segment of the power boat market where retail purchasers are generally less significantly affected by price or other economic conditions 
consequently  management believes that the impact of inflation on sales and the results of operations will not be material
