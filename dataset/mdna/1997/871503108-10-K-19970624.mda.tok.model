sales  international sales and customer support 
symantec markets its products worldwide utilizing a multi channel strategy of direct sales and indirect sales through independent software distributors  major retail chains and resellers 
sales and marketing symantec utilizes both direct and indirect sales forces to encourage end users to adopt symantec s products as corporate standards 
the direct sales force focuses primarily on site license sales where a license for multiple workstations is sold to a customer at a negotiated price 
the sales cycle with respect to site license sales may be lengthy and may be subject to integration and acceptance by the customer

end users may return products through dealers and distributors within a reasonable period from the date of purchase for a full refund  and retailers may return older versions of products 
various distributors and resellers may have different return policies that may negatively impact the level of products which are returned to symantec 
product returns occur when the company introduces upgrades and new versions of products or when distributors order too much product 
in addition  competitive factors often require the company to offer rights of return for products that distributors or retail stores are unable to sell

volume incentive rebates are accrued when revenue is recorded 
the amount of these rebates as a percentage of net revenues has been consistent for all periods presented and has not had a material impact on the company s liquidity 
from time to time  symantec makes available rebates to end users of various products who acquired the products through major retailers 
end user rebates are accrued when revenue is recorded

product development and acquisitions 
symantec uses a multiple products sourcing strategy that includes internal development  acquisitions of product lines or companies and licensing from third parties 
symantec typically develops new products and enhancements of existing products in one of its two core product groups remote productivity solutions and security and assistance and in selected product areas targeted as emerging business opportunities 
each group s responsibilities include design  development  documentation and quality assurance 
independent contractors are used for certain aspects of the product development process and elements of certain company products are licensed from third party developers 
symantec uses strategic acquisitions  as necessary  to provide certain technology  people and products for its overall product strategy 
the company has completed a number of acquisitions and dispositions of companies and products and may acquire and dispose other companies and products in the future

symantec s total research and development expenses were approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred 
in fiscal  symantec capitalized approximately million of capitalized software development costs  primarily related to network administration technology  which was sold to hewlett packard in march  resulting in the write off of approximately million of unamortized costs during fiscal no material software development costs have been capitalized by the company in fiscal  while prior to being acquired by symantec  delrina capitalized approximately million in software development costs in fiscal year see further discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business risks operating system and uncertainty of research and development efforts 
competition 
the microcomputer software market is intensely competitive and is subject to rapid changes in both technology and the strategic direction of major microcomputer hardware manufacturers and operating system providers 
the company s competitiveness depends on its ability to enhance its existing products and to offer new products on a timely basis 
the company has limited resources and must restrict its product development efforts to a relatively small number of projects 
see further discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business risks rapid technological change and development risks 
operating system vendors such as microsoft have added features to new versions of their products that provide some of the same functionality traditionally offered in symantec s products 
symantec believes this trend may continue 
microsoft may incorporate advanced features in future versions of operating systems that may decrease the demand for certain of the company s products  including those currently under development 
a number of software developers have integrated antivirus capabilities into their internet products 
while symantec plans to continue to improve its products with a view toward providing enhanced functionality over what may be provided in operating systems  there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that such improved products will be commercially accepted by software users 
symantec will also attempt to work with operating system vendors in an effort to make its products compatible with those operating systems  yet differentiate those utility products from features included in the operating systems 
however  there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful

the company competes with at least one product from many of the major independent software vendors  including borland international  inc borland  cybermedia cybermedia  dr solomon s dr solomon s  elan software corporation elan  international business machines corporation ibm  mcafee associates  inc mcafee  microcom  inc 
microcom  microsoft  norton lambert corporation norton lambert  phoenix technologies ltd 
phoenix  touchstone software corporation touchstone  traveling software  inc traveling software  starfish software  inc starfish and sofnet  inc 
sofnet 
for example  norton utilities competes with operating systems  such as microsoft s windows and msdos and ibm s dos  which offer file recovery  anti virus and backup features  first aid from cybermedia and other products from various other utilities vendors 
norton antivirus competes with pc cillin from touchstone  dr solomon s anti virus toolkit from dr 
solomon s and viruscan from mcafee 
symantec s pcanywhere competes mainly with laplink from traveling software  carbon copy from microcom  close up from norton lambert and netremote from mcafee 
act competes with lotus organizer for windows from ibm  outlook from microsoft  goldmine from elan  sidekick from starfish and many other personal information managers produced by various software developers 
delrina winfax pro competes with products offered by phoenix  traveling software and sofnet  as well as microsoft s windows operating system 
cafe mainly competes with products from microsoft 
in addition  these and other company products compete less directly with a number of other products that offer levels of functionality different from those offered by symantec s products or that were designed for a somewhat different group of end users than those targeted by symantec 
symantec also competes with microcomputer hardware manufacturers that develop their own software products 
further  symantec competes with other microcomputer software companies for access to the channels of retail distribution and for the attention of customers at the retail level and in corporate accounts 
finally  symantec competes with other software companies in its efforts to acquire products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties 
symantec believes that competition in the industry will continue to intensify as most major software companies expand their product lines into additional product categories 
some of the company s competitors have substantial financial  marketing and technological resources

manufacturing and backlog 
symantec s product development organization produces a set of master diskettes and documentation for each product 
most of symantec s domestic manufacturing is performed by outside contractors under the supervision of symantec s manufacturing organization 
purchasing of most raw materials and fulfillment of most orders is done by symantec personnel in symantec s sunnyvale  california facility 
the manufacturing steps that are subcontracted to outside organizations include the duplication of diskettes and cd rom s  printing of documentation materials and assembly of the final package 
symantec performs diskette duplication and assembly of the final package in its dublin  ireland manufacturing facility for most products distributed outside of the united states  canada and latin america 
symantec has often been able to acquire materials on a volume discount basis and has had multiple sources of supply for certain materials 
to date  symantec has not experienced any material difficulties or delays in production of its software and related documentation and packaging 
however  shortages may occur in the future 
for example  shortages of certain materials may occur when microsoft introduces new operating systems 
see further discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business risks supply risk 
symantec normally ships products within one week after receiving an order 
thus  symantec does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of future performance 
price competition 
price competition is intense in the microcomputer business software market and is expected to continue to increase and become even more significant in the future 
see further discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
seasonality 
while symantec s diverse product line has tended to lessen fluctuations in quarterly net revenues  these fluctuations have occurred and may occur in the future 
these fluctuations may be caused by a number of factors  including the timing of announcements and releases of new or enhanced versions of symantec s products and product upgrades  the introduction of competitive products by existing or new competitors  reduced demand for any given product  seasonality in the retail software market in foreign markets  customer end of period buying patterns and the market s transition between operating systems 
these factors may cause significant fluctuations in net revenues and  accordingly  operating results 
see further discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business risks fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
product protection 
symantec regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of copyright  patent and trademark laws and license agreements in an attempt to protect its rights 
see further discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business risks intellectual property rights 
employees 
as of march   symantec employed approximately  people  including  in sales  marketing and related staff activities  in product development and in management  manufacturing  administration and finance 
none of the employees is represented by a labor union  and symantec has experienced no work stoppages 
symantec believes that its employee relations are good 
competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry is intense 
symantec believes that its future success will depend in part on its ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management  marketing and technical personnel 
symantec believes that it must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package  which necessitates the continued availability of stock options and requires ongoing shareholder approval of such option programs

delrina exchangeable stock may be converted into symantec common stock on a one for one basis at each stockholder s option 
all of these acquisitions were accounted for as poolings of interest 
accordingly  all financial information has been restated to reflect the combined operations of these companies and symantec with the exception of fast track  intec and slr  which had results of operations that were not material to symantec s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth each item from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues and the percentage change in the total amount of each item for the periods indicated

net revenues 
net revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal net revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product groups 
during fiscal  the company experienced increased net revenues from each of its core product groups remote productivity solutions and security and assistance 
the remote productivity solutions product group is focused on helping remote professionals remain productive  by addressing customer needs to access information  applications and data from any location 
the security and assistance product group is dedicated to being indispensable to customers daily use of computers by increasing productivity and keeping computers safe and reliable 
the market s acceptance of the windows and windows nt operating systems  as well as the further expansion of personal computer sales  enabled symantec to experience strong fiscal sales of its windows products first introduced during the last half of fiscal and windows nt products introduced in fiscal the most significant product line sales growth was related to the norton antivirus products from the security and assistance product group and pcanywhere products from the remote productivity solutions product group 
during fiscal  the financial impact of product price reductions for symantec s core products was more than offset by the increase in the volume of products sold  resulting in increased net revenues 
symantec s third business unit is the emerging business and other product group  which includes products providing an easy to use java development environment  as well as revenue streams from the sale of certain of the company s software product lines and revenues from products nearing the end of their life cycles 
fiscal net revenues for the emerging business product group decreased from fiscal  largely as the result of declining sales from products which symantec no longer actively develops or markets 
symantec expanded its line of java development tools in fiscal in response to wider acceptance of the java development environment  resulting in an increase in net revenues for the java product line during fiscal the emerging business and other product group also recorded approximately million of consulting net revenues in fiscal  resulting from a non recurring consulting contract which was completed during the fiscal year 
as a result of the sale of its electronic forms software products and related tangible assets to jetform corporation jetform for approximately million in fiscal  the emerging business and other product group recognized revenue of approximately million during the fiscal year and is contractually entitled to quarterly revenue payments through the june quarter 
jetform has the option to tender payment in either cash or in registered jetform common stock  within a contractually defined quantity threshold 
due to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate collectibility of these installments  symantec is recognizing the related revenue as payments are due and collectibility is assured from jetform 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  symantec also sold the software products and related tangible assets of its networking business unit to the hewlett packard company hewlett packard  resulting in the receipt of approximately million of revenue and million research and development expense reimbursement by the emerging business and other product group 
additionally  over the next two years  hewlett packard is contractually obligated to pay to symantec a royalty stream not to exceed the present value of million  which is contingent upon future sales of certain products by hewlett packard 
due to the uncertainty regarding the amounts upon which these royalties will be determined  symantec is recognizing these amounts as they are estimable 
during fiscal  the company experienced increased net revenues from its security and assistance product group  offset in part by decreased revenues from its remote productivity solutions product group and products which symantec no longer actively develops or markets 
symantec experienced an increase in net revenue from the introduction of several windows products  however  this increase was substantially offset by a decrease in net revenues related to windows and dos products 
symantec markets its products through a number of distribution channels  including retail  site licenses  oem  direct marketing and upgrades and the internet 
the retail channel is symantec s single largest product channel and comprises approximately of total product revenues 
international 
net revenues from international sales were million and million and represented and of total net revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in international net revenue as a percentage of total net revenue is the result of domestic revenue growth outpacing international revenue growth during the fiscal year 
additionally  international revenues for fiscal includes the one time recognition of approximately million  previously deferred central point revenue 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations during fiscal did not materially contribute to the fluctuation in results from fiscal to fiscal net revenues from international sales increased by million in fiscal  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was largely the result of the one time recognition in fiscal of approximately million of previously deferred central point revenue 
product returns 
the level of actual product returns and related product return provision are largely a factor of the level of product sell in gross revenue from normal sales activity and the replacement of obsolete quantities with the current version of the company s products 
changes in the levels of product returns and related product return provision are generally offset by changing levels of gross revenue and  therefore  do not typically have a material impact on reported net revenues 
the company s product return provision typically fluctuate from period to period based upon the level and timing of product upgrade releases and changes in product sell in 
the product return provision for fiscal was higher than the provision for fiscal due to increased returns exposure for windows products due to additional product sell in during fiscal the product return provision for fiscal was higher than the provision for fiscal  due to the introduction of symantec s windows products during the last three quarters of fiscal  which had unusually high sell in volumes 
gross margin 
gross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing expenses  costs for producing manuals  packaging costs  royalties paid to third parties under publishing contracts and amortization and write off of capitalized software 
prior to fiscal  accounting rules requiring capitalization of certain software development costs did not materially affect the company  except for amounts capitalized by delrina prior to its acquisition by symantec in fiscal amounts capitalized during fiscal primarily related to the networking business unit which was sold to hewlett packard in march  at which time the amounts were written off 
amortization of capitalized software  including amortization and the write off of both purchased product rights and capitalized software development expenses  totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
included in the fiscal total is approximately million of unamortized capitalized software development expenses and million of unamortized purchased software product rights related to network administration technology written off as part of the sale to hewlett packard in march the fiscal write off of unamortized formflow technology sold to jetform was immaterial 
amortization expense in fiscal year was lower than in due to capitalized software write offs in fiscal related to de emphasized products and delrina windows products 
the fiscal amortization of capitalized software expense included the aforementioned write offs  resulting in the significant increase in expense from fiscal gross margins increased to of net revenues in fiscal from in fiscal and from in fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the decrease in capitalized software amortization and write offs noted above 
in addition  revenues  with no related cost of revenues  from jetform totaling million and from hewlett packard totaling million were included in net revenues during fiscal the decline in the gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to an increase in the amortization and write off of purchased product rights and capitalized software development expenses noted above and increased inventory reserves related to delrina products designed to operate on windows and other products de emphasized by symantec during fiscal due to an anticipated reduction in software amortization and the recognition of the potential future revenue streams from jetform and hewlett packard  for which there will be no associated costs  symantec believes that the gross margin percentage may increase to approximately to in fiscal  unless there is a significant change in symantec s net revenues 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million or of net revenues in fiscal from million or of net revenues in fiscal and were million or of net revenues in fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due primarily to decreased product development efforts associated with the company s decision to cease developing certain software products  and an increase in capitalized software development costs 
in fiscal  symantec capitalized approximately million of software development costs  primarily related to network administration technology  which was subsequently sold to hewlett packard in march and resulted in the write off of approximately million in unamortized costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  a million research and development expense reimbursement was received from hewlett packard in fiscal under the aforementioned agreement  which further reduced fiscal research and development expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of increased product development efforts associated with symantec s and delrina s development of new products designed to operate on the windows operating system 
research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred 
prior to fiscal  capitalization of certain software development costs in accordance with statement of accounting standards no 
did not materially affect the company  except for amounts capitalized by delrina prior to its acquisition by symantec in fiscal delrina did not capitalize any software development costs in fiscal and capitalized approximately million in software development costs in fiscal year sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million or of net revenues in fiscal from million or of net revenues in fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due primarily to the elimination of duplicative sales and marketing expenses as a result of the acquisition of delrina by symantec and the elimination of sales and marketing expenses related to the electronic forms software products which were sold to jetform in september reductions in expenditures for products no longer actively marketed by symantec were offset by increased spending for new products released during the fiscal year 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million or of net revenues in fiscal from million or of net revenues in fiscal  due to an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with the release of symantec s windows products 
general and administrative expenses 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased by to million or of net revenues from million or of net revenues in fiscal and from million or of net revenues in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily the result of management consulting expenditures  offset by benefits from the elimination of duplicative general and administrative expenses as a result of the acquisition of delrina by symantec in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal as compared to fiscal was principally due to significant general and administrative expenses incurred by delrina in the three month period ended september  and certain legal fees incurred by delrina 
acquisition  restructuring and other expenses 
acquisition expenses 
in connection with the acquisitions completed in fiscal  and see summary of significant accounting policies and note of notes to consolidated financial statements  significant acquisition expenses have been incurred 
these acquisition expenses principally included fees for legal  accounting and financial advisory services  the write off of duplicative capitalized technology  the modification of certain development contracts and expenses related to the combination of the companies  including the elimination of duplicative and excess facilities and personnel 
these charges approximated million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
symantec recorded total acquisition charges of approximately million in fiscal in connection with the acquisition of fast track 
in connection with the acquisition of delrina in fiscal  symantec recorded total acquisition charges of million  which included million for legal  accounting and financial advisory services  million for the elimination of duplicative and excess facilities and equipment  million for personnel severance and outplacement expenses and million for the consolidation and discontinuance of certain operational activities and other acquisition related expenses 
offsetting these costs was a reduction in accrued acquisition  restructuring and other expenses of million  as actual costs incurred related to the acquisitions of central point and slr were less than costs previously accrued by the company 
in connection with the acquisitions of central point and slr  symantec recorded total acquisition charges of million in fiscal the charges included million for legal  accounting and financial advisory services  million for the write off of duplicative product related expenses and modification of certain development contracts  million for the elimination of duplicative and excess facilities  million for personnel severance and outplacement expenses and million for the consolidation and discontinuance of certain operational activities and other acquisition related expenses 
restructuring expenses 
in fiscal  the company recorded a charge of million for costs related to the restructuring of certain domestic and international sales and research and development operations  settlement of the carmel lawsuit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k and other expenses 
the restructuring plans have been completed 
in february  symantec announced a plan to consolidate certain research and development activities 
this plan was designed to gain greater synergy between the company s third generation language and fourth generation language development groups 
during fiscal  the company completed the consolidation and recorded million for the relocation costs of moving equipment and personnel 
other expenses 
in fiscal  symantec recorded a million charge in connection with the write off of an equity investment and a million charge for the write off of certain in process research and development acquired by the company 
in fiscal  symantec sold the assets of time line solutions corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary  to a group comprised of time line solutions corporation s management and incurred a million loss on the sale 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded million for estimated legal fees expected to be incurred in connection with a securities class action complaint filed in march and other legal matters see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k 
as of march   total accrued cash related acquisition and restructuring expenses were million and included less than million for estimated legal fees and expenses  less than million for the elimination of duplicative and excess facilities and million for other acquisition related expenses 
interest income  interest expense and other income expense 
interest income was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
higher average cash balances during fiscal compared to fiscal were offset by lower interest rates on invested cash during the year 
interest income increased in fiscal over fiscal due to higher average invested cash balances 
interest expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the april conversion of convertible subordinated debentures totaling million  which were originally issued in april  for  shares of symantec common stock  resulted in a reduction in interest expense in fiscal from and in fiscal from other income expense is primarily comprised of foreign currency exchange gains and losses from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
income taxes 
the effective income tax provision for fiscal was  which compares to an effective income tax benefit of in fiscal and an effective tax provision of in fiscal the income tax provision of is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of previously unbenefitted losses 
realization of the million of net deferred tax asset that is reflected in the financial statements is dependent upon the company s ability to generate sufficient future us taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized based on forecasted us earnings 
a valuation allowance of approximately million was provided in the financial statements 
approximately million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is attributable to unbenefitted stock option deductions  the benefit of which will be credited to equity when realized 
approximately million of the valuation allowance represents net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of various acquired companies that are limited by separate return limitations and under the change of ownership rules of internal revenue code section  and the remaining million of the valuation allowance relates to unbenefitted temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
symantec projects the effective tax rate to be in fiscal this rate is lower than the expected u 
s 
federal and state combined statutory rate of is due to a lower tax rate from the company s irish operation and the utilization of previously unbenefitted losses 
however  this projection is subject to change due to fluctuations in and the geographic allocation of earnings 
see further discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business risks fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
liquidity and capital resources cash  short term investments and restricted investments increased million to million at march  from million at march  this increase was largely due to cash provided from operating activities  net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sales of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan  and improved cash collections of trade accounts receivable 
cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by the reclassification of million to restricted investments  a non current asset 
the restricted investment balance relates to collateral requirements under lease agreements entered into by symantec during the current fiscal year 
symantec is obligated under lease agreements for two existing office buildings  one parcel of land and one office building under construction in cupertino  california to maintain a restricted cash balance invested in us treasury notes with maturities not to exceed three years 
in accordance with the lease terms  these funds would not be available to meet operating cash requirements 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and was comprised of the company s net income of million and non cash related expenses of million and a net decrease in assets and liabilities of million 
trade accounts receivable decreased million from million at march  to million at march  primarily due to improved cash collections during the year 
on april   the board of directors of symantec authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of symantec common stock by june  the shares will be used for employee stock purchase programs and option grants 
as of june   management completed the repurchase of  shares at prices ranging from to per share 
the company has a million line of credit that expires in march the company was in compliance with the debt covenants at march  at march   there were no borrowings outstanding under this line and there were less than million of standby letters of credit outstanding under this agreement 
future acquisitions by the company may cause the company to be in violation of the line of credit covenants  however  the company believes that if the line of credit were canceled or amounts were not available under the line  there would not be a material adverse impact on the financial results  liquidity or capital resources of the company 
symantec is obligated under lease agreements for two existing office buildings  one parcel of land and one office building under construction in cupertino  california to maintain a restricted cash balance invested in us treasury notes with maturities not to exceed three years 
in accordance with the lease terms  these funds would not be available to meet operating cash requirements 
if symantec were to sustain significant losses  the company could be required to reduce operating expenses  which could result in product delays  reassessment of acquisition opportunities  which could negatively impact the company s growth objectives  and or pursue further financing options 
the company believes existing cash and short term investments will be sufficient to fund operations for the next year 
see further discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business risks fluctuations in quarterly operating results and management of expanding operations 
business risks the preceding discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
there are several important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results and percentages and results anticipated by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion 
rapid technological change and development risks 
the company participates in a highly dynamic industry 
future technology or market changes may cause certain of symantec s products to become obsolete more quickly than expected and the trend towards server based applications in networks and over the internet could have a material adverse effect on sales of the company s products 
the impact of the market s acceptance and adoption rate of symantec s products may result in reduced revenues  gross margins and net income  as well as significant increases in the volatility of symantec s stock price 
stock price volatility 
the company s earnings and stock price have been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
symantec has previously experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts  which has had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
this may occur again in the future 
additionally  as a significant portion of the company s revenues often occur late in the quarter  the company may not learn of revenue shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
personal computer and hardware growth rates 
fluctuations in customer spending from software to hardware as the result of technological advancements in hardware or price reductions of hardware have in the past and may in the future result in reduced revenues which would have a material adverse effect on operating results 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
while symantec s diverse product line has tended to lessen fluctuations in quarterly net revenues  these fluctuations have occurred in the past and are likely to occur in the future 
these fluctuations may be caused by a number of factors  including the introduction of competitive products by new competitors  reduced demand for any given product  seasonality in the retail software market  the market s transition between operating systems  the impact of the internet and general economic conditions 
these factors may cause significant fluctuations in net revenues and  accordingly  operating results 
management of expanding operations 
symantec continually evaluates its product and corporate strategy and has in the past and will in the future undertake organizational changes and product and marketing strategy modifications which are designed to maximize market penetration  maximize use of limited corporate resources and develop new products and product channels 
these organizational changes increase the risk that objectives will not be met due to the allocation of valuable resources to implement changes 
further  due to the uncertain nature of any of these undertakings  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that the company will realize any benefit from these efforts 
symantec has completed a number of acquisitions and may acquire other companies in the future 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the diversion of management s attention to assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies in an efficient and timely manner  the retention of key employees  the difficulty of presenting a unified corporate image  the coordination of research and development and sales efforts and the integration of the acquired products 
the company has lost certain key employees of acquired companies  and  in some cases  the assimilation of the operations of acquired companies took longer than initially had been anticipated by the company 
in addition  because the employees of acquired companies have frequently remained in their existing  geographically diverse facilities  the company has not realized certain economies of scale that might otherwise have been achieved 
symantec typically incurs significant expenses in connection with acquisitions  which have a significant adverse impact on the company s profitability and financial resources 
these expenses may have a significant adverse impact on the company s future profitability and financial resources 
foreign operations 
a significant portion of symantec s revenues  manufacturing costs and marketing is transacted in foreign currencies 
as a result  the company may be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  as well as increases in duty rates  exchange or price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies 
the company s international operations are subject to certain risks common to international operations  such as government regulations  import restrictions  currency fluctuations  repatriation restrictions and  in certain jurisdictions  reduced protection for the company s copyrights and trademarks 
price competition 
price competition is intense in the microcomputer business software market and is expected to continue to increase and become even more significant in the future  resulting in reduced profit margins 
should competitive pressures in the industry continue to increase  symantec may be required to reduce software prices and or increase its spending on sales  marketing and research and development as a percentage of net revenues  resulting in lower profit margins 
there can be no assurance these changes will be successful 
distribution channels 
approximately of the company s net revenues in fiscal were from sales to two large retail distributors 
these customers tend to make the majority of their purchases at the end of the fiscal quarter  in part because they are able  or believe that they are able  to negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms 
this end of period buying pattern means that forecasts of quarterly and annual financial results are particularly vulnerable to the risk that they will not be achieved  either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on less favorable terms to the company 
the company s retail distribution customers also carry the products of symantec s competitors 
the distributors have limited capital to invest in inventory  and their decisions to purchase the company s products is partly a function of pricing  terms and special promotions offered by symantec as well as by its competitors over which the company has no control and which it cannot predict 
agreements with distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by either party without cause 
such distributors are not within the control of symantec  are not obligated to purchase products and may also represent competitors product lines 
there can be no assurance that these distributors will continue their current relationships with symantec on the same basis  or that they will not give higher priority to the sale of other products  which could include products of competitors 
additionally  certain distributors and resellers have experienced financial difficulties in the past 
there can be no assurance that distributors that account for significant sales of the company will not experience financial difficulties in the future 
any such problems could lead to reduced sales and could adversely affect operating results of the company 
there can be no assurance that symantec will be able to continue to obtain adequate distribution channels for all of its products in the future 
due to the rapid change in software distribution technology as demonstrated by the increase in volume of software distributed through the internet  there can be no assurance that symantec will be able to develop an effective method of distributing its software products utilizing each of the available distribution channels or that symantec will develop distribution channels for those channels which are ultimately accepted by the marketplace 
the presence of new channels could adversely impact existing channels and or product pricing  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s net revenues and profitability 
the company operates with relatively little backlog  therefore  if near term demand for the company s products weakens in a given quarter  there could be an immediate  material adverse effect on net revenues and on the company s operating results  which would likely result in a precipitous drop in stock price 
channel fill 
the company s pattern of revenues and earnings may be affected by channel fill 
channel fill occurs following the introduction of a new product as distributors buy significant quantities of the new product in anticipation of sales of such product 
software upgrades typically result in an increase in net revenues during the first three to six months following their introduction due to purchases by existing users  usually at discounted prices  and initial inventory purchases by symantec s distributors 
following such purchases  the rate of distributors purchases often declines in a material amount  depending on the rates of purchases by end users or sell through 
as the desktop applications market has become more saturated  the sales mix is shifting from standard retail products to lower priced product upgrades 
this trend is likely to continue 
channel fill may also occur in anticipation of price increases or in response to sales promotions or incentives  some of which may be designed to encourage customers to accelerate purchases that might otherwise occur in later periods 
channels may also become filled simply because the distributors do not sell their inventories to retail distribution or end users as anticipated 
if sell through does not occur at a sufficient rate  distributors will delay purchases or cancel orders in later periods or return prior purchases in order to reduce their inventories 
such order delays or cancellations can cause material fluctuations in revenues from one quarter to the next 
the impact is somewhat mitigated by the company s deferral of revenue associated with inventories estimated to be in excess of appropriate levels in the distribution channel  however  net revenues may still be materially affected favorably or adversely by the effects of channel fill 
between the date symantec announces a new version or new product and the date of release  distributors  dealers and end users often delay purchases  cancel orders or return products in anticipation of the availability of the new version or new product 
channel fill did not have a material impact on the company s revenues in fiscal  or but may have a material impact in future periods  particularly in periods where a large number of new products are simultaneously introduced 
product returns 
the company estimates and maintains reserves for product returns 
product returns can occur when the company introduces upgrades and new versions of products or when distributors have excess inventories 
symantec s return policy allows its distributors  subject to certain limitations  to return purchased products in exchange for new products or for credit towards future purchases 
end users may return products through dealers and distributors within a reasonable period from the date of purchase for a full refund  and retailers may return older versions of products 
symantec prepares detailed analyses of historical return rates  as well as taking into consideration upcoming product upgrades  current market conditions  customer inventory balances and any other known factors when estimating anticipated returns and maintains reserves for product returns 
symantec has experienced  and may experience in the future  significant increases in product returns above historical levels from customers of acquired companies after an acquisition is completed 
the impact of actual returns on net revenues  net of such provisions  has not had a material effect on the company s liquidity as the returns typically result in the issuance of credit towards future purchases as opposed to cash payments to the distributors 
however  there can be no assurance that future returns will not exceed the reserves established by the company or that future returns will not have material adverse effect on the operating results of the company 
uncertainty of research and development efforts 
symantec believes research and development expenditures will be necessary in order to remain competitive 
while the company believes its research and development expenditures will result in successful product introductions  due to the uncertainty of software development projects  these expenditures will not necessarily result in successful product introductions 
uncertainties impacting the success of software development project introductions include technical difficulties  market conditions  competitive products and customer acceptance of new products and operating systems 
the length of symantec s product development cycle has generally been greater than symantec originally expected 
although such delays have undoubtedly had a material adverse effect on symantec s business  symantec is not able to quantify the magnitude of net revenues that were deferred or lost as a result of any particular delay because symantec is not able to predict the amount of net revenues that would have been obtained had the original development expectations been met 
delays in future product development are likely to occur and could have a material adverse effect on the amount and timing of future revenues 
due to the inherent uncertainties of software development projects  symantec does not generally disclose or announce the specific expected shipment date of the company s product introductions 
while the company performs extensive usability and beta testing of new products  there can be no assurance that any products currently being developed by symantec will be technologically successful  that any resulting products will achieve market acceptance or that the company s products will be effective in competing with products either currently in the market or introduced in the future 
operating system 
the release and subsequent customer acceptance of current or enhanced operating systems are particularly important events that increase the uncertainty and increase the volatility of symantec s results 
microsoft has incorporated advanced utilities including telecommunications  facsimile and data recovery utilities in windows and may include additional product features in future releases of windows and window nt that may decrease the demand for certain of the company s products  including those currently under development 
should the company be unable to successfully or timely develop products that operate under existing or new operating systems  the company s future net revenues and operating results would be immediately and significantly adversely affected 
in addition  as the timing of delivery and adoption of many of symantec s products is dependent on the adoption rate of these operating systems  which the company and securities analysts are unable to predict  the ability of symantec and securities analysts to forecast the company s net revenues has been and will continue to be adversely impacted 
as a result  there is a heightened risk that net revenues and profits will not be in line with analysts expectations in the periods following the introduction of existing or new operating systems 
intellectual property rights 
symantec regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of copyright  patent and trademark laws and license agreements in an attempt to protect its rights 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of symantec s products or to obtain and use information that symantec regards as proprietary 
all of symantec s products are protected by copyright  and symantec has several patents and patent applications pending 
however  existing patent and copyright laws afford limited practical protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect symantec s proprietary rights in its products to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
symantec s products are not copy protected 
as the number of software products in the industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap  symantec believes that software developers will become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
this risk is potentially greater for companies  such as symantec  that obtain certain of their products through publishing agreements or acquisitions  since they have less direct control over the development of those products 
in addition  an increasing number of patents are being issued that are potentially applicable to software  and allegations of patent infringement are becoming increasingly common in the software industry 
it is impossible to ascertain all possible patent infringement claims because new patents are being issued continually  the subject of patent applications is confidential until a patent is issued  and it may not be apparent even from a patent that has already been issued whether it is potentially applicable to a particular software product 
this increases the risk that symantec s products may be subject to claims of patent infringement 
although such claims may ultimately prove to be without merit  they are time consuming and expensive to defend 
symantec has been involved in disputes claiming patent infringement in the past  is currently involved in such disputes and litigation and may be involved in such disputes and or litigation in the future 
if symantec is alleged to infringe one or more patents  it may choose to litigate the claim and or seek an appropriate license 
if litigation were to commence and a license were not available on reasonable terms or if another party were found to have a valid patent claim against symantec  it could have a material adverse effect on symantec see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation 
symantec is involved in a number of other judicial and administrative proceedings incidental to its business see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company intends to defend and or pursue all of these lawsuits vigorously and  although an unfavorable outcome could occur in one or more of the cases  the final resolution of these lawsuits  individually or in the aggregate  is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
however  depending on the amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits  it is possible that the company s future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely effected in a particular period 
sales and marketing and support investments 
symantec believes substantial sales and marketing efforts are essential to achieve revenue growth and to maintain and enhance symantec s competitive position 
there can be no assurance that these increased sales and marketing efforts will be successful 
business disruption 
much of the company s administration  sales and marketing  manufacturing and research and development facilities are located on the west coast of the united states 
future earthquakes or other natural disasters could cause a significant disruption to the company s operations and may cause delays in product development that could adversely impact future revenues of the company 
order entry and product shipping are geographically separated both domestically and internationally 
a disruption in communications between these facilities  particularly at the end of a fiscal quarter  would likely result in an unexpected shortfall in net revenues and could result in an adverse impact on operating results 
supply risk 
symantec has often been able to acquire materials on a volume discount basis and has had multiple sources of supply for certain materials 
to date  symantec has not experienced any material difficulties or delays in production of its software and related documentation and packaging 
however  shortages may occur in the future 
for example  shortages of certain materials may occur when microsoft introduces new operating systems 
employee risk 
competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry is intense 
symantec believes that its future success will depend in part on its ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management  marketing and technical personnel 
symantec believes that it must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package  which necessitates the continued availability of stock options and requires ongoing shareholder approval of such option programs
