item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes a number of forward looking statements that are subject to many uncertainties and may turn out not to be accurate 
see business for a discussion of factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
results of operations as reflected in the accompanying financial statements  net income was  in   in  and  in net income for increased when compared to due to higher operating profits within the livestock  farming and commercial and land use divisions 
net income for decreased when compared to due primarily to lower operating profits within the livestock and commercial and land use divisions 
also affecting net income was the   or 
per share  after tax charge off of producing almond trees destroyed by winter storms during january changes in revenues and expenses of registrant s industry segments for the years and are summarized below 
livestock 
livestock operating profits of  in  grew  when compared to operating profits 
the growth in net operating income is due to a decrease in cost of sales  which was partially offset by reduced cattle sales revenue 
cost of sales declined during due to cattle not being placed in feedlots for the same period of time as was done in and to better grazing conditions during during  registrant delayed the sale of approximately  head of cattle from may to october and placed these cattle in feedlots during the summer months of the expense associated with four extra months of feedlot costs during is the primary reason for the favorable cost of sales variance 
the reduction in cattle sales revenue is due primarily to fewer pounds of cattle being sold in than in during  more head of cattle were sold   head of cattle compared to  head of cattle in  but at weights which were approximately pounds per cow less than in when cattle were held in feedlots for four extra months 
as in cattle prices per pound continued to be depressed throughout during  registrant continued to use the futures and options market to protect the future selling price of cattle 
without the ability to hedge cattle and feed positions  registrant would have sustained a net loss on the sale of its cattle during gains on hedge positions totalled approximately  many of these gains were due to the continuing decline of cattle prices during  especially during the first half of registrant s goal in hedging its cattle is to protect or create a range of selling prices that in years like and  allow registrant to recognize a profit on the sale of cattle once all costs are deducted 
the risk in hedging cattle prices is that in those years that prices increase the hedge may limit or cap potential gains from the increase in price 
due to the cyclical nature of beef production  the national cattlemen s association nca has estimated that consumption per capita in the us could decline over the next six years due to increases in price 
however  based on studies by the nca total demand for beef products should continue to grow due to population growth and further growth in beef exports 
the cattle industry has just gone through the low price segment of the current cattle inventory cycle and some producers have been forced out of the business 
feeder cattle and calf supplies appear to have just passed peak levels for this cycle 
the supply of feeder cattle and calves outside of feedlots is still large  but should decline significantly during the next several years 
exports of beef are likely to exceed total imports  making the us a net exporter of beef on a volume basis for the first time in history 
on  march   registrant purchased the assets of a feedlot that is located in western texas 
registrant will operate this feedlot for its use as well as that of other customers who want to feed cattle 
the feedlot was purchased for million  has a cattle head capacity of  and covers approximately acres 
registrant believes that by controlling the feeding phase of its cattle before sending them to packing houses that a better quality product will be produced providing higher margins to registrant 
registrant believes that the revenues generated by the new feedlot operation will be material to future earnings 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements for the pro forma effect of the asset purchase 
in connection with the purchase of the feedlot registrant is beginning a program in and to expand the cattle herd to approximately  head 
this will allow registrant to potentially increase the earnings from its cattle operations and provide additional cattle for the feedlot operation  livestock operating profits of  in decreased  or almost  when compared to operating results 
the decrease in operating profits is due primarily to increases in cost of sales  and the continuing decline of cattle prices during cattle sales revenue increased  during  which partially offset the increase in cost of sales 
cost of sales increased during due to registrant delaying the sale of approximately  head of cattle from may to october and placing the cattle in feedlots during the summer months 
the extra four months of feedlot costs and an increase in the number of head sold during were primary factors in the increase in cost of sales 
registrant delayed the sale of cattle during due to the low cattle prices during may by delaying the sale  these cattle increased in weight from approximately pounds to approximately  pounds at the time of sale in october 
the increase in weight of cattle sold and the increase in number of cattle sold led to the increase in cattle sales revenue during total cattle sold during were  compared to  during prices received during were approximately per pound less than received during by extending the cattle feeding phase  registrant realized net profits from the sale of those cattle of approximately  more than if the cattle had been sold during may as is normally the case 
see part i  item business livestock operations for a further discussion of registrant s livestock operations for and future expectations 
farming 
farming operating profits increased  to  which is a increase over operating profits 
in comparison to  net operating income increased due to higher pistachio revenues  higher grape revenues  higher almond revenues  and the charge off of destroyed almond trees of  which occurred during partially offsetting these favorable variances was an increase in fixed water costs of  and in cultural costs of  the increase in cultural costs is primarily due to higher harvesting costs 
the increase in grape revenues grew  due to increases in prices during on average the price received by registrant increased approximately per ton of grapes 
the almond revenue increase during was due to a increase in production 
the increase in production was partially offset by almond prices falling when compared to prices 
pistachio revenues were  higher in due to an increase in production 
pistachio production increased approximately because was the on production year in the alternate year bearing cycle 
walnut revenues increased  during due to prices rising approximately during overall crop revenues were higher than expected due mainly to higher almond and wine grape prices 
almond  walnut  and pistachio demand is expected to remain good during and the near future 
industry expectations are that state wide nut crop yields could improve when compared to  which may negatively impact prices 
in addition  industry projections show a continuation of new almond and pistachio plantings that could impact prices once full production begins 
in registrant signed a five year contract with a winery that provides the better of a minimum price or market price for grapes each year 
this contract is beneficial to the registrant because it helps minimize future price fluctuations 
within the grape industry there continues to be new land developed  which could depress prices in the future once all new developments are in full production 
however  in the near term grape prices should continue to be favorable due to the growth in wine consumption and grape shortages over the last two years 
all of registrant s crops are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop 
large crops in california and abroad can rapidly depress prices 
for a further discussion of the farming year refer to part i  item business farming operations 
farming operating profits of  during were  or less than operating profits 
the decrease in net earnings is due to the   after tax charge off of destroyed almond trees  lower almond production  reduced pistachio production due to being the alternate bearing year  and to higher cultural costs and water costs 
partially offsetting these unfavorable variances was an increase in almond prices during  the release of the almond reserve  during  and higher grape revenues 
cultural costs increased approximately  due to unfavorable weather conditions  storm cleanup costs  and the addition of acres of rubired grapes 
changes in individual crop revenues in compared to were significant 
grape revenues increased  due to increases in production and prices during of the  favorable variance in grape revenues   is related to the addition of acres of rubired grapes that were purchased during february almond revenues increased  during in spite of lower production due to a increase in prices and to the release of the almond reserve 
walnut revenues increased  due to improved production and a increase in prices during pistachio revenues fell approximately  due to lower production 
pistachio volumes decreased because was the off production year in the alternate year bearing cycle 
during january  a portion of registrant s farming operations suffered damages as a result of high winds that were associated with a series of winter storms 
nearly all of the loss occurred in registrant s producing almond orchards 
approximately acres of trees were uprooted by a combination of high winds and saturated soil conditions due to heavy rainfall 
the lost trees represented of registrant s mature  almond producing orchards 
as a result of the storm damage  registrant recorded a charge to earnings as described above 
registrant completed replanting the damaged acreage with almond trees during february the loss of mature trees will affect future revenues until the replanted crops begin full production  which could take three to five years from date of planting 
oil and minerals 
oil and mineral operating profits of  in was  or below operating profits 
the decrease in net operating income during was due to lower sand rock aggregate royalties  reduced land lease income  and increased professional service fees and staffing costs 
partially offsetting these unfavorable variances were increases in oil and gas royalties and cement royalties 
sand rock aggregate royalties declined due to winter weather during early which delayed the start of several construction projects 
land lease revenue continues to decline due to the economics of exploring for oil within california 
professional service fees and staffing costs increased due to the ongoing management of and monitoring of the activities of oil and gas lessees and monitoring of environmental activities at the national cement lease site 
oil and gas royalties increased due to an increase in oil prices throughout  and cement royalties were higher due to increases in production because of the growth in construction within southern california 
the oil and mineral division has been very profitable over the last several years 
however  this is an area of operating revenues that is expected to be adversely affected over the next few years by the fact little or no new oil and gas exploration activity is being undertaken by lessees on registrant s lands 
see part i  item business oil and minerals  for a further discussion of activities and future expectations 
oil and mineral operating profits of  during were  or less than operating profits 
the decrease in operating profits during were due primarily to lower land lease income and to increased professional service fees 
an increase in cement royalties during partially offset the above unfavorable variances 
professional service fees increased due to registrant spending considerable time negotiating with lessees to perform the required field development or abandonment of idle wells 
enforcement of lease requirements increased the number of operating wells in operation during land lease revenues declined and are expected to continue to decline due to the economics of exploring for oil within california 
cement royalties increased approximately during due to increases in production 
commercial and land use 
the operating loss of  is a  improvement over s operating loss of  the improvement in is due to a decrease in professional service fees  an increase in film location fees  and a gain from the sale of land 
partially offsetting the above favorable variances was an increase in fixed water costs of  registrant s commercial lease revenue during was flat when compared to lease revenues 
professional service fees declined due to the timing of planning activities on registrant s lands related to the i corridor and the absence of any costs during related to the proposed major crude oil pipeline through registrant s land 
the costs associated with the pipeline were incurred during and are discussed below 
film location fees increased due to the continued growth of the southern california entertainment industry  which resulted in more opportunities for advertisement  television  and motion picture location filming 
fixed water costs grew due to the transfer of additional state water project water that can be used in the future for municipal and industrial uses 
in addition to the cost of this additional water  a local water district charged registrant for costs related to a water banking program 
as to future activities registrant is currently evaluating the feasibility of expanding retail services at the grapevine interchange and adding additional services for the trucking industry at the laval road interchange 
see part i  item  properties land planning for a further discussion of planning activities 
an operating loss of  during compares to a operating loss of  for the commercial and land use division 
the decrease when compared to is due to an increase in professional service fees  and an increase in staffing costs  during partially offsetting these negative variances was an increase in commercial rents and right of way income of  commercial rents increased due to improved traffic flows and to the addition of another fast food outlet at the laval road interchange 
professional service costs increased due primarily to legal  legislative  and public affairs activity registrant was involved in related to a proposed major crude oil pipeline through the ranch 
during december registrant completed negotiations with respect to an easement for the crude oil pipeline 
the actual date of start of construction on the pipeline is not known at this time 
upon the start of construction registrant will receive a substantial payment that will be recorded as right of way and easement revenues 
this potential revenue will not be received until construction of the pipeline begins 
interest 
interest income fell  or  when compared to interest income 
the reduction during is due primarily to lower average invested dollars throughout when compared to on average million was invested during while million was invested during investment funds declined due to capital expenditures and the payment of dividends 
interest income of  during was  or  less than interest income 
the decrease when compared to is due to lower gains on the sale of securities  lower interest rates during and to lower outstanding investment balances 
investment funds continued to decline during due to the purchase of land  the payment of dividends  and to capital expenditures 
interest expense declined in to  from  in interest expense during was attributable to the remaining balance of long term debt used to finance registrant s acre almond and acre wine grape developments  which were developed in  and use of registrant s working capital line of credit 
the increase in expense during was due to registrant increasing the usage of short term lines of credit which became necessary because of delays in the sale of cattle and the timing of crop proceeds 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses for were  or  higher than corporate expenses for the increase in costs is primarily due an increase in staffing costs  and employee relocation costs 
these variances were partially offset by a reduction in professional service fees 
the increase in staffing costs and relocation costs was primarily related to the hiring of a new chief executive officer in may corporate expenses during increased  or  when compared to expenses 
the increase was due primarily to higher professional service fees  and maintenance fees 
partially offsetting these unfavorable variances was a decrease in staff costs of  professional service costs were higher because of fees related to the chief executive officer search 
staffing costs fell due to the president resigning during the middle of inflation 
inflation can have a major impact on registrant s operations 
the farming operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues due to an oversupply of certain crops and very high irrigation water costs 
high fixed water costs related to registrant s farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings 
prices received by registrant for many of its products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices 
therefore  it is difficult for registrant to accurately predict revenue  just as it cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation  except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices 
impact of accounting change 
registrant adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting and disclosure of stock based compensation  at year end december  registrant will continue to apply apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  for the accounting of stock options and provide the appropriate disclosures and pro forma information as described in sfas no 
financial condition 
registrant s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled approximately  at december   an increase of from the corresponding amount at the end of working capital at the end of was  which is comparable to s working capital 
working capital uses during the year were for capital expenditures and the payment of dividends 
registrant has a revolving line of credit of  that as of december  had a balance of  at an interest rate of 
the outstanding balance on registrant s revolving credit line was paid down during january the revolving line of credit is used as a short term cash management tool 
the principal uses of cash and cash equivalents during   and consisted of capital expenditures  purchase of land  payments of long term debt and the payment of dividends 
the accurate forecasting of cash flows by registrant is made difficult due to the fact that commodity markets set the prices for the majority of registrant s products and the fact that the cost of water changes significantly from year to year as a result of changes in its availability 
registrant  based on its past experience  believes it will have adequate cash flows over the next twelve months to fund internal operations 
during   has been budgeted for capital expenditures  which includes new equipment and improvements to existing facilities 
as mentioned above  registrant purchased the assets of a feedlot  this purchase was done with cash which will lower the outstanding balance of short term investments by approximately million 
in the future  registrant may leverage these new assets and use the funds for other investments 
registrant is evaluating the possibility of new farming developments and expansion of the cattle herd 
these potential new projects will be funded from current cash resources and registrant s excess borrowing capacity 
registrant has traditionally funded its growth and capital additions from internally generated funds 
management believes that the combination of short term investments  excess borrowing capacity  and capital presently available to it will be sufficient for its near term operations
