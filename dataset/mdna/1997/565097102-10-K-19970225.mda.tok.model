management believes  however  that mapco has sufficient capacity to fund its anticipated needs 
inflation during the past five years  mapco has benefitted from the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states 
however  mapco s operating costs are influenced to a greater extent by specific price changes in energy products than by changes in general inflation 
crude  refined petroleum product and natural gas liquids prices are particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or the expectations of traders concerning the supply and demand balance in the near future 
these costs could increase with a possible adverse effect on mapco s profitability 
although every effort will be made to do so  it is possible that mapco  like many other companies  may not be able to adjust its sales prices to maintain parity with operating costs 
other mapco maintains property and liability insurance at limits believed to be sufficient to cover estimated potential risks 
losses up to deductible amounts of the various coverages would not have a material effect on mapco s financial position  liquidity or results of operations
