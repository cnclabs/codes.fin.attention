item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information this review contains forward looking statements concerning firstar s business results that are based on estimates 
actual results could differ materially due to factors such as changes in economic conditions  compression of net interest revenue due to unanticipated declines in net interest margins and outstanding loan balances  unanticipated delays in cost reduction and revenue enhancements  and the ability of the company to attract and retain qualified personnel 
therefore  there can be no assurances that actual results will correspond to these forward looking statements

net interest margin 

during  net interest revenue increased to million 
this follows a similar growth of in the growth in both years benefited from higher average earning asset balances 
average earning assets rose by during  mostly attributable to assets acquired through bank acquisitions 
this compared to a increase in average earning assets in this positive impact was somewhat offset by a reduction in the net interest margin in both years 
the net interest margin for was compared with in and in the margin has been relatively stable during the past two years with the margin generally trending upward on a quarterly basis during changes in overall interest rates during the past two years were moderate and thus more predictable than was the case in during that year the prime rate rose from to and together with other market rate swings reduced firstar s margin by 
from to the rates earned on average earning assets in declined by  or basis points  due primarily as a result of lower commercial loan rates 
the corresponding reduction in the cost of funds rate was basis points  thus reducing the net interest margin in the decline in the margin from to is seen in the basis point increase in the rate paid on fund sources which was matched by only a basis point increase in the earning asset rate 
also there was a shift in the earning assets mix in to securities which reduced the overall return on earning assets 
benefiting the margin was  however  the basis point increase attributable to interest free funds supporting earning assets 
the higher rate environment places a higher value on these interest free funds 
foregone interest on nonperforming loans and foreclosed assets reduced net interest revenue by million in  million in and million in this resulted in corresponding reductions in net interest margin of 
in each of the last three years 
this nominal impact is a reflection of firstar s continued low level of nonperforming assets

trust and investment management fees are the single largest source of fee revenue for the company  contributing million  or approximately one third of total other operating revenue 
trust fees have risen by over in both of the past two years 
the general rise in the market value of assets contributed to the growth achieved in both years 
in addition  expanded services are being offered through firstar s banking network and additional marketing efforts are also being directed to institutional investors beyond the midwest 
assets under management increased by during to a level of billion which follows the increase during the mix of assets under management has shifted somewhat to fixed income and money market funds where average fees are lower than equity funds  thus limiting fee growth 
assets held in custody accounts were billion at year end  a increase from last year

firstar capitalized million in originated service rights in and million in further information on mortgage servicing rights activities is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
data processing fee income increased by in following an decline in the previous year 
one half of the increase for was attributable to an early buyout by a customer who was acquired by another bank 
a shrinking customer base due to continuing bank consolidations through mergers or acquisitions and conversions by smaller community banks to in house data processing systems have acted to reduce revenues over the past several years 
intense price competition has also occurred due to the shrinking market for sales and has affected revenue levels through pricing changes and some loss of customers 
fee revenue in this business should remain under pressure in coming years 
brokerage services increased by during and in this encouraging growth in fee revenue was attributable to the general strength of the market and more focused sales efforts

a measure of the success in managing operating expense is expressed in the ratio of expense to revenue and is referred to as the efficiency ratio 
the objective is to reduce this ratio through revenue growth  cost control or a combination of both

firstar s goal is for the efficiency ratio to be or better for impacting this ratio for will be the accounting treatment of the million in trust capital securities issued in december these securities qualify as tier i capital for regulatory purposes and are accounted for as minority interest 
accordingly  the cash distributions on these securities will be recorded as an other expense item in the company s income statement 
provisions for loan losses the provision for loan losses is used to cover actual loan losses and to adjust the size of the reserve relative to the amount and quality of loans

credit risk management since the mid s  credit management has been refined through procedural and personnel changes 
emphasis on credit quality standards and diversification of risk have been key strategies 
the benefits of this program are seen in the significant reductions in nonperforming assets and overall credit quality achieved during the past several years 
during this period nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and foreclosed assets have declined from over in to 
at the end of nonperforming assets consist of loans that are not accruing interest  loans with renegotiated credit terms and collateral acquired in settlement of nonperforming loans

firstar experienced an increase in real estate related nonperforming assets several years ago  although to a much lesser extent than many other financial institutions 
these assets stood at million at the end of and represented of their respective loan category 
as can be seen in table  significant progress has been made in reducing this category of nonperforming assets 
the remaining commercial loan portfolio had related nonperforming assets of and a ratio of 
of outstanding loans compared to

this increase can be attributable to a single credit placed into nonaccrual at the end of rather than any fundamental change in asset quality trends of firstar s commercial customers 
nonperforming consumer loans have increased over the last two years by million to million at the end of this represented 
of consumer loans at december  compared to 
a year earlier and 
at the end of while consumer nonperforming loans remain at a minimal level  the increase from year to year reflects the impact of consumers taking on increased debt burdens in the past two years 
the effect of this trend can also be seen in the increased consumer loan charge off levels of loans ninety days or more past due on december   totaled million  compared with million a year earlier 
these loans are on a full accrual basis and are judged by management to be collectible in full 
in addition  firstar had million of loans at december   on which interest is accruing  but  because of existing economic conditions or circumstances of the borrower  doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present loan terms 
while these loans are identified as requiring additional monitoring  they do not necessarily represent future nonperforming assets 
additional indicators of asset quality can be found in the geographic distribution  industry diversification and type of lending represented in the loan portfolio 
credit policies have been changed over the past several years to reduce vulnerability to potential adverse economic trends 
marketing efforts have been directed to firstar s primary market segments which are consumer  small business and middle market customers in communities where firstar banks are located 
this emphasis on smaller  locally based credits brings with it a diversified group of customers without any significant industry concentration 
firstar does not participate in any significant syndicated lending or highly leveraged transactions

comparable data not available total net charge offs of million represented

level experienced in as a regional financial institution  firstar lends to a diversified group of midwestern borrowers and  to a much lesser degree  to national companies with midwest operations 
net charge offs in this commercial segment of the portfolio were million  or 
of average loans 
this is a consistent with the million of net charge offs in  representing 
of loans 
this relatively low level of charge offs reflects the general high quality of this portion of the portfolio 
commercial mortgage loans net charge offs were under one half million dollars in or only 
of average commercial mortgage loans 
this was a reduction from the 
level of the prior year 
increased recoveries of previously charged off loans were a factor 
future charge off levels in this area should track with the overall experience level of the other commercial lending areas of the company 
consumer lending includes loans to individuals in communities served by firstar s banks 
these loans include both open ended credit arrangements subject to an overall limit per customer  such as credit card and home equity loans  and closed end loans subject to specific contractual payment schedules  such as installment loans and residential mortgages 
consumer net charge offs were million in  compared with million in and million in the net charge offs of 
in compares with 
and 
in and  respectively 
consumer delinquency rates and bankruptcies have increased over the past several quarters as the economic cycle progresses 
increased consumer charge offs have been the result of this trend 
credit card losses have increased from million in to million in the related charge off rate has increased from of outstanding loans to during the same time period 
charge off levels in the last quarter of were at an annualized rate of 
additional credit related measures have been taken which should reverse this trend 
credit card charge offs will most likely remain at the higher levels experienced in the second half of during most of before beginning to decline 
other consumer lending in the form of home equity loans and installment debt has seen increased charge off levels in the past two years  but at a significantly lower rate than credit cards 
these loss levels were at

in losses on consumer mortgages have been and should remain nominal 
liquidity and interest rate risk management two objectives of firstar s asset and liability management strategy include the maintenance of appropriate liquidity and management of interest rate risk 
liquidity management aligns sources and uses of funds to meet the cash flow requirements of customers and firstar 
interest rate risk management seeks to generate growth in net interest revenue and manage exposure to risks associated with interest rate movements and provide for acceptable and predictable results 
although conceptually distinct  liquidity and interest rate sensitivity must be managed together since action taken with respect to one often influences the other 
asset liquidity is generally provided by short term investments such as interest bearing deposits with other banks  federal funds sold and repurchase agreements 
these investments totaled million at december  securities that have been designated as available for sale were billion at the end of and can be sold to meet liquidity needs 
the remaining securities portfolio  which is held to maturity  provides liquidity through scheduled maturities and the ability to use these securities in repurchase agreements

table maturity range of time deposits total due within three to six to after december  three months six months twelve months twelve months thousands of dollars certificates of deposit of  or more      the requirement of liquidity is diminished by the predominance of core deposits  which account for of firstar s fund sources 
stable core deposits do not require significant amounts of liquidity to meet the net withdrawal demands of customers on a short or intermediate term basis 
other sources of liquidity are short term borrowed funds  federal home loan bank borrowings and commercial time deposits which totaled billion at the end of firstar s ability to refinance maturing amounts and  when necessary  increase this funding base is a significant factor in its liquidity management 
additionally  firstar has access to capital markets through the issuance of debt or other securities 
long term debt was increased in with the issuance of million of five year notes 
in december  a million issue of trust capital securities was completed 
these securities were issued to fund stock repurchases  repayment of outstanding indebtedness and for other corporate purposes 
firstar also has in place a million revolving credit facility 
the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on earnings 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changing interest rates 
firstar uses computer simulation modeling as its primary method of quantifying and evaluating interest rate risk 
simulation modeling is performed at least quarterly and is used to quantify the impact on net interest revenue of various assumptions about interest rate and balance sheet changes and the use of off balance sheet derivatives and financial instruments 
the use of simulation modeling also enables firstar to develop and test alternative asset and liability management strategies 
interest rate risk and the results of the simulation modeling is reviewed quarterly by bank  regional and corporate committees who assess the interest rate risk position and approve corresponding strategies 
the objective of firstar s asset liability management policy is to maintain adequate capital and liquidity and manage interest rate risk to produce an acceptable level of net interest revenue 
firstar s guideline is to employ an asset liability management strategy which limits the potential impact of projected interest rate changes to of net income over the subsequent four quarters 
in the most recent simulation  net interest revenue was forecast for under four interest rate scenarios 
first  if current rates continued unchanged with a prime rate of  and then under most likely  high and low interest rate scenarios in which prime rate changes to  and respectively  by the fourth quarter of compared to the current rate scenario  under these three other scenarios net interest revenue in is simulated to change as follows under the most likely and high scenarios  net interest revenue in is simulated to increase by million and million  respectively 
under the low scenario  net interest revenue is simulated to decline by million 
the result of these scenarios are well within firstar s of net income risk policy 
the simulation model is supplemented with a tool used in the banking industry for measurement of interest rate risk known as the gap analysis 
this measures the difference between assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within specified time periods 
the gap analysis does  however  have limitations such as not reflecting the magnitude with which assets or liabilities may reprice within a given interest rate scenario 
a positive gap indicates that there are more rate sensitive assets than rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a given time frame 
a positive gap would generally imply a favorable impact on net income in periods of rising rates 
conversely  a negative gap indicates a liability sensitive position

firstar enters into interest rate swaps  caps and floors as part of this process 
these derivative instruments synthetically alter the repricing characteristics of designated assets and liabilities 
firstar s off balance sheet financial derivative portfolio has a notional amount of million as of december  additional information on derivative financial instruments is included in notes and to the consolidated financial statements

the market price of a share of firstar common stock closed the year at  a increase from a year earlier 
total market capitalization at december  was nearly billion 
firstar s capital management plan strives to match longer term capital needs with maintaining sound capital levels 
it also seeks to provide to shareholders a total return consistent with the best performing companies 
firstar has taken actions with respect to this capital management strategy 
in december firstar issued  through firstar capital trust i  million of trust capital securities 
these securities qualify as tier i capital and are mandatorily redeemable in years 
the capital securities are similar to preferred stock but have the tax advantage of deductibility of the cash distributions 
a two for one stock split was announced in january with the issuance of the shares occurring february  this action recognizes the doubling of the market price per share of firstar stock over the past two years and returns the price to an attractive per share level with wider appeal to individual investors 
all per share data included in these financial statements have been restated to give effect to this stock split 
a major stock repurchase program was announced in january the program will buy back and retire up to million shares of common stock representing of shares outstanding 
in addition  firstar will repurchase common shares for reissue to fund employee stock plans 
firstar has sought to manage capital levels through stock repurchases 
these shares have been either retired or reserved for issuance in acquisitions or for employee stock plans 
previous programs have resulted in the repurchase of million shares in and million shares in at a cost of and million in each respective year 
of these shares  million were retired  million were reissued in acquisitions  million were reissued for employee stock plans  and thousand were reissued in preferred stock conversions 
dividends paid to common stockholders totaled million  or

bank regulatory agencies have established capital adequacy standards which are used extensively in their monitoring and control of the industry 
these standards relate capital to level of risk by assigning different weightings to assets and certain off balance sheet activity 
capital is measured by two risk based ratios tier i capital and total capital  which includes tier ii capital 
the rules require that companies have minimum ratios of and for tier i and total capital  respectively 
as of december   firstar had tier i capital of and total capital of  significantly exceeding regulatory minimum standards 
firstar is considered well capitalized by its regulatory agency 
the components of these capital levels are shown in table additionally  a tier i leverage ratio is also used by bank regulators as another measure of capital strength 
this ratio compares tier i capital to total reported assets reduced by goodwill 
the regulatory minimum level of this ratio is  and it acts as a constraint on the degree to which a company can leverage its equity base 
firstar s tier i leverage ratio was at december  it is firstar s intent to manage its tier i leverage ratio at the top quartile level of its peers which is currently approximately
