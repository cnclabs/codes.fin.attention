item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations s omitted except share amounts results of operations general from august to september   several of the company s subsidiaries conducted refining operations 
by december   the company s refining subsidiaries had sold all of their refining assets 
in addition  powerine  one of the company s refining subsidiaries  merged into a subsidiary of emc and was no longer a subsidiary of the company 
the company s other refining subsidiaries own no refining assets and are in the process of liquidation 
as a result  the company has accounted for its refining operations as discontinued operations in the company s financial statements as of september  and retroactively 
accordingly  discussion of results of operations has been confined to the results of continuing operations and the anticipated impact  if any  of liquidation of the remaining inactive refining subsidiaries 
as noted above  the company sold its rusk county  texas oil and gas properties and pipeline to uprc and one of its subsidiaries in may the oil and gas reserves sold approximated of the company s oil and gas reserves at the date of sale 
as a result operations applicable to the assets sold only impacted consolidated operations for eight months in fiscal versus twelve months in fiscal  and fiscal vs fiscal natural gas marketing and transmission gas sales from natural gas marketing and transmission increased  or from fiscal to the increase consists of the following september  gas sales to lone star   gas sales to mgng   lone star contact natural gas sales under the lone star contract increased  or from fiscal to fiscal under the company s long term gas sales contract with lone star  the price received for gas is essentially fixed through may  the variance in gas sales  therefore  is almost entirely attributable to the volumes of gas delivered 
although the volumes sold to lone star annually are essentially fixed the lone star contract has a take or pay provision  the lone star contract year is from february to january whereas the company s fiscal year is from october to september furthermore  although the volumes to be taken by lone star in a given contract year are fixed  there is no provision requiring fixed monthly or daily volumes and deliveries accordingly vary with lone star s seasonal and peak demands 
such variances have been significant 
as a result  lone star deliveries  although fixed for a contract year  may be skewed and not proportional for the company s fiscal periods 
for fiscal  deliveries and sales to lone star  including those derived from the company s own production  were approximately less than those which would have resulted if daily deliveries had been fixed and equal 
at september   the remaining volumes to be delivered under the lone star contract were approximately greater than those that would be delivered to lone star if daily deliveries were fixed and equal 
gas sales to mgng increased  or from fiscal to fiscal because such sales commenced june  since sales to mgng are for equal daily volumes at fixed prices the increase in gas sales is directly proportional to the increase in the sales period 
gas purchases increased  or from fiscal to fiscal the increase consists of the following september  gas purchases lone star contract   gas purchases mgng contract   gas purchases for the lone star contract increased  or from fiscal to fiscal for fiscal gas purchases comprised of gas sales versus of gas sales for fiscal from to the gross margin increased or 
during the same periods the gross margin percentage gas sales gas purchases as a percentage of gas sales decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in gas purchases as a percentage of gas sales and the concomitant decrease in the gross margin percentage result from offsetting factors 
the cost of gas decreased because the company replaced gas contracts that expired in april with market price contracts 
the expiring contracts called for gas prices substantially in excess of market prices whereas the replacement gas contracts are at market prices  resulting in the decreased costs to the company for a portion of the gas it supplies to lone star 
this reduction was offset by the higher gas prices that the company had to pay for the of its gas that it supplies to lone star and that is not hedged and to a minor degree by a non recurring favorable gas purchase adjustment in the first quarter of fiscal which had no counterpart in fiscal gas purchases applicable to the mgng contract as a percentage of related sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal the gross margin was versus a deficit of in fiscal the increase in the cost of gas purchases and related decrease in the gross margin were caused by increases in spot gas prices  net of hedging adjustments 
operating costs decreased or from fiscal to fiscal most of the decrease is attributable to the sale of the castle pipeline to upipc on may  other factors accounting for the decrease include the termination of two pipeline employees in january  when the company still operated the castle pipeline and decreased insurance costs  property taxes and compressor maintenance costs during the first eight months of fiscal versus the first eight months of fiscal general and administrative costs decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the primary factor causing the decrease was the sale of the castle pipeline to upipc on may   resulting in only minor general and administrative expense thereafter 
other factors causing the decrease were the termination of management agreements with subsidiaries of mg in january and the performance of their functions internally without additional costs and decreased insurance cost 
these were offset by an increase due to a severance payment to the former president of the company s natural gas marketing subsidiary in january although the company still markets natural gas  it no longer owns or operates its texas pipeline 
future natural gas marketing general and administrative expenses are expected to be immaterial 
transportation transportation expense increased from zero for fiscal to for fiscal all of the transportation expense for fiscal was incurred from june  to september  and results from the amortization of the prepaid transportation asset received from upipc in the sale of the castle pipeline see note to the financial statements 
prior to the sale to upipc  the company owned and operated the castle pipeline and intercompany transportation charges were eliminated in consolidation 
commencing june   the company commenced amortizing the  prepaid transportation asset over the remaining term of the lone star contract  which expires on may  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease results from the sale of the castle pipeline to upipc on may  the decrease approximates the amount of depreciation and depletion that would have been incurred had the castle pipeline not been sold 
exploration and production oil and gas sales decreased  or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease results primarily from the sale of of the company s proved reserves to uprc on may  see note to the financial statements 
in fiscal oil and gas sales applicable to such reserves were for twelve months versus only eight months in fiscal in addition to the sale of the properties to uprc  two other offsetting factors are relevant 
oil and gas sales decreased due to a decrease in production volumes 
the decline in production volumes results from the general maturing of the company s reserves since the company has not made any significant reserve acquisitions and did not conduct any significant drilling until july this decrease was offset by an increase in oil and gas prices in fiscal as a result of the sale to uprc  the company s oil and gas production is expected to decrease by at least 
nevertheless  the company has recently entered into a joint venture with another operator to drill up to appalachian wells over the next three to four years and is also in the process of drilling approximately coalbed methane wells in alabama 
in addition  the company is currently reviewing several possible acquisitions of oil and gas assets 
as a result the company expects to replace some of the production and reserves that it sold to uprc 
revenues from well operations decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease results primarily from operating revenues lost when the company sold its rusk county  texas oil and gas properties to uprc in may oil and gas production expenses decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease was caused by the sale of the company s rusk county oil and gas properties to uprc on may  in fiscal oil and gas production expenses were of oil and gas sales versus of oil and gas sales in fiscal the increase in production expenses as a percentage of oil and gas sales results from the general maturing of the company s oil and gas properties  the lack of new drilling by the company for most of the recent fiscal year and the tendency for older depleting properties to carry a higher production expense burden than recently drilled properties 
as noted above  the company has commenced several drilling activities and the oil and gas production expense ratio may improve in the future  although there can be no assurance such will be the case 
general and administrative expenses decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease results from offsetting factors 
general and administrative expenses decreased because the company closed its tulsa office in june and because the company sold its rusk county  texas oil and gas properties to uprc in may these decreases were offset  however  by increased legal fees due to the larry long litigation which was filed in july see note to the financial statements 
depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease was primarily caused by the sale of the company s rusk county  texas oil and gas properties to uprc on may  had the properties not been sold to uprc  depreciation  depletion and amortization for fiscal would have been approximately higher 
on may   the company sold its texas oil and gas properties and pipeline see note to the financial statements 
the sale resulted in a  non recurring gain 
there was no counterpart in fiscal interest income increased or primarily because of interest earned from june  to september  on the unspent proceeds from the sale of the company s texas oil and gas properties and pipeline see note to the financial statements 
other income expense decreased  from  of other income for fiscal to other expenses of for fiscal of the  of other income in   represented recoveries from a plaintiff class escrow fund related to stockholder litigation 
the parties reached a settlement with respect to the stockholder litigation in october the proceeds to the company represent unclaimed funds that were to revert to the company pursuant to the settlement order for the litigation 
interest expense decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the net decrease in interest expense is attributable to offsetting factors 
amortization of debt issuance costs  which is treated as interest expense under generally accepted accounting principles  increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase is attributable to debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the company s refinancing of its senior debt 
interest expense  on the other hand  decreased  from  for fiscal to for fiscal primarily because the average debt outstanding during fiscal was less than that outstanding during fiscal on may   the company repaid its debt 
the company does not anticipate that it will need debt financing in the foreseeable future 
tax provision as a result of the tax benefit recorded in fiscal  the company expected to provide for income taxes at a blended statutory rate for the remainder of the lone star contract for book purposes 
during this period the company expected to pay income taxes  however  at a effective rate  consisting of federal alternative minimum tax 
the company s tax provision for fiscal consists of two components a 
the tax provision on pre tax accounting income  exclusive of the  gain on the sale of assets  aggregates  and essentially represents the amortization of the  deferred tax asset recorded at september  at an effective rate of of earnings 
if future events change the company s estimate concerning the probability of utilizing its tax assets  appropriate adjustments will be made when such a conclusion is reached 
b 
the tax provision on the  gain equals the company s expected tax liability for the income related to the sale and aggregates the tax rate used in such calculation was  the federal alternative minimum tax rate 
the company is not subject to a higher tax rate due to its carryforwards 
a tax provision of was not provided for the gain because a related deferred tax asset was previously reserved since the company did not anticipate selling the properties and had previously taken the properties off the market 
fiscal vs fiscal revenues gas sales from natural gas marketing decreased  or from fiscal to fiscal the net decrease was caused by three factors one of which increased gas sales and the other two of which decreased gas sales 
gas sales increased  or as a result of gas sales to mgng commencing in june of and other gas sales in the first half of fiscal in fiscal virtually all gas sales were to lone star 
this increase was offset by a scheduled reduction in contract volumes under the lone star contract and a reduction in volumes of gas otherwise delivered to lone star in fiscal although the volumes sold to lone star annually are essentially fixed the lone star contract has a take or pay provision  the lone star contract year is from february to january whereas the company s fiscal year is from october to september furthermore  although the volumes to be taken by lone star in a given contract year are fixed  there is no provision requiring fixed monthly or daily volumes and deliveries accordingly vary with lone star s seasonal and peak demands 
such variances have been significant 
as a result  lone star deliveries  although fixed for a contract year  may be skewed and not proportional for the company s fiscal year 
oil and gas sales from the exploration and production segment increased or 
as a result of offsetting factors 
production  expressed in equivalent units of natural gas  decreased approximately while the prices received for oil and gas production increased approximately 
at the current time gas prices are high although there can be no assurance this trend will continue 
expenses gas purchases decreased  or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease closely parallels the decrease in gas sales 
in fiscal gas purchases comprised of gas sales versus of gas sales in fiscal oil and gas production expenses decreased or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease results primarily from two factors decreased ad valorem property taxes and decreased well maintenance in the summer of when the company expected to sell its oil and gas properties 
as a result of such deferral of maintenance  it is anticipated that oil and gas production expenses will be slightly higher in fiscal now that the company has withdrawn its oil and gas properties from the market and expects to continue to operate and produce them 
general and administrative expenses applicable to the exploration and production segment increased or from fiscal to fiscal the increase was caused by increased salaries  insurance and employee benefit costs and increased legal fees 
depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased or 
approximately of the decrease was caused by and parallels a decrease in oil and gas production 
the remaining decrease is attributable to changes in estimates concerning proved reserves 
corporate general and administrative expenses decreased  or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to decreased legal fees  employee salaries and employee benefits 
other income increased  or 
all of the increase is attributable to recoveries from a plaintiff escrow fund related to shareholder litigation 
the amount recovered and recorded as other income in fiscal was  there was no counterpart to this item in fiscal interest expense decreased  or from fiscal to fiscal the decrease parallels the decrease in outstanding long term debt 
as a result of the refinancing of the gecc loan on november  the company replaced a fixed rate of interest with a floating interest rate equal to the prime rate plus 
the prime rate is currently 
as a result of the refinancing  changes in the prime rate will henceforth impact the company s interest expense and results of operations 
the income tax benefit has been determined pursuant to financial accounting standards number accounting for income taxes fas 
the tax benefit in fiscal results from changes in management s assessment of the probability of future taxable income 
as a result of the tax benefit recorded in fiscal  the company expects to provide for income taxes at a blended statutory rate for the remainder of the lone star contract for book purposes 
during this period the company expects to pay income taxes at a effective rate  consisting of federal alternative minimum tax see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company generated  of cash flow from operating activities   from the sale of its rusk county oil and gas properties and pipeline to uprc and upipc  respectively  and from the exercise of stock options  resulting in a total of  of cash flow generated 
of this amount   net was used to repay debt   was used to repurchase the company s stock   was invested in oil and gas properties and  was spent for other investing financing activities  resulting in an increase in unrestricted cash of  at september   the company s working capital was  versus a deficit of  at september  subsequent to september   the company also received an  payment from mg 
also at september   the company was free of long term debt  having repaid its revolving credit facility with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of its oil and gas properties and pipeline to uprc and upipc  respectively 
at september   the company contemplated paying off its senior debt and financing the drilling of its undrilled texas acreage 
as a result of the sale to uprc and the cash proceeds received  the company s liquidity and capital resource posture changed significantly 
the company  after repayment of long term debt  had approximately  of cash but had sold most of its oil and gas assets 
after lengthy consideration  the company decided to continue operations rather than to liquidate for the following reasons a 
the company s remaining oil and gas production was viable and included undrilled acreage 
b 
the company s natural gas marketing contract with lone star would not terminate until may  and the company would have had to sell this contract at a significant discount to liquidate 
c 
given current litigation and on going contractual relationships  liquidation would be cumbersome and expensive and several contingent obligations would remain 
d 
management believes that there are several promising opportunities for investment in the oil and gas business specifically and the energy sector generally 
nevertheless  the company s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to  of the company s outstanding shares to provide an exit vehicle for investors who wanted to liquidate their investment in the company 
as of september and november    shares had been repurchased at a cost of  average price share 
in conjunction with its intention to increase its oil and gas assets  the company is currently undertaking a well drilling program on its undrilled coalbed methane acreage in alabama 
it has also entered into a joint venture to drill up to wells in appalachia over the next three to four years 
these drilling activities will require capital costs of approximately  from the company  including  through september  in addition  subsequent to september   the company invested  in a promissory note to penn octane corporation  a public company involved in the liquid petroleum gas and compressed natural gas businesses see note to the financial statements 
the company is also currently evaluating other possible acquisitions and investments in the exploration and production business 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements all statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this report are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements in this report generally are accompanied by words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  or expect or similar statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove correct 
factors that could cause the company s results to differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements are disclosed in this report  including without limitation in conjunction with the expected cash receipts and expected cash obligations included below 
all forward looking statements in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph 
as a result of the sale of its oil and gas properties and pipeline and the repayment of its revolving credit facility  the company had  in unrestricted cash and owed no long term debt as of september  in addition  the company retains its gas sales contract with lone star and a portion of its exploration and production business 
an estimate of the company s expected cash resources and obligations from october  to september  is as follows expected cash resources s omitted cash on hand october   cash flow gas marketing and remaining exploration and production operations  repayment of penn octane corporation note  proceeds from powerine arbitration received subsequent to september   additional proceeds from powerine arbitration  proceeds from platinum recovery irlp proceeds from swap litigation irlp proceeds from american western note  interest  expected cash obligations liquidation of working capital new drilling  purchase of  additional shares of common stock of the company  purchase of note of penn octane corporation paid subsequent to september  quarterly dividends based on outstanding shares at november  less additional purchases of  shares  irlp payment of vendors and funding of environmental reserves  excess of expected cash resources over expected cash obligations  the following apply to the company s expected cash resources and obligations a 
interest income on cash has been computed at 
if unanticipated expenditures are made or interest rates decrease  interest income will decrease 
b 
the company is currently evaluating several investments in the energy sector but has not yet made any additional commitments 
it may  nevertheless  do so in the future 
the above cash estimates do not include any expenditures for such investments 
c 
the company s board of directors has authorized the purchase by the company of up to  shares of common stock in the open market 
to date   shares have been repurchased 
the company may or may not repurchase the remaining  shares available  depending on market prices and other factors and such repurchases may be at a different price than assumed in the above estimates 
d 
although the company s board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend policy of 
per quarter  the board may elect to change such policy at any time 
e 
the company has assumed certain cash returns from its recent drilling activities 
there can be no assurance that such drilling activities will be successful or that the projected returns will be achieved 
in addition to the foregoing  the above estimates assume that the company will not be adversely impacted by any of the following risk factors 
if such events occur  the company s estimated cash flow will probably be adversely affected and such effects may be material 
contingent environmental liabilities although the company has never itself conducted refining operations and its refining subsidiaries have exited the refining business and the company does not anticipate any required expenditures related to discontinued refining operations  interested parties could seek redress from the company for environmental liabilities 
in the past  government and other plaintiffs have often named the most financially capable parties in such cases regardless of the existence or extent of actual liability 
as a result there exists the possibility that the company could be named for any environmental claims related to discontinued refining operations of its present and former refining subsidiaries 
the company has recently been informed that the united states environmental protection agency is investigating offsite acid sludge waste found near the indian refinery and is also remediating surface contamination in the indian refinery property recently sold by american western see below 
neither the company nor irlp has been named with respect to these actions 
finally  the bankruptcy court handling american western s bankruptcy proceedings has approved american western s petition to sell the indian refinery to an outside third party purchaser 
if that outside purchaser dismantles and salvages the indian refinery rather than operates it  the remediation of related environmental contamination and claims against potentially responsible parties may be accelerated 
although the company does not believe it has any liability with respect to environmental matters of its current and former refining subsidiaries and would contest any claim  courts might find otherwise and the cost and time to litigate such claims would be material and adversely affect the estimated cash flow above 
any resulting litigation could last several years and divert the company s resources 
irlp vendor liabilities irlp owes its vendors approximately  its only major asset is a  note due from the purchaser of the indian refinery  american western 
irlp believes that it can fully discharge its vendor liabilities if it receives the entire  due from the american western note 
in november  american western filed for bankruptcy and has recently sold the indian refinery to an outside party 
it appears that approximately  will be available for creditors of american western and environmental reserves from the proceeds of the sale 
although irlp holds a first mortgage on the indian refinery  other creditors of american western hold liens superior to that of irlp and creditors with inferior liens may attempt to circumvent irlp s first mortgage 
it is  therefore  unlikely that irlp s share of the proceeds will be sufficient to settle its vendor liabilities 
if irlp cannot settle its vendor liabilities  irlp may file for bankruptcy since its only significant asset is its note due from american western 
in addition  the illinois department of revenue recently filed to assess two present officers of the company and two former officers of the company for certain tax liabilities of irlp 
the company has responded that its officers are not liable for the taxes 
although the company does not believe such developments will affect its estimated cash flow  such may not be the case 
irlp s vendors may attempt to hold the company liable for irlp s debts and or the illinois department of revenue may prevail in its efforts to assess officers of the company for irlp liabilities  in which case the company would have indemnification obligations to such officers 
in either case the company s estimated cash flow may be adversely affected 
ioc bankruptcy ioc  another wholly owned subsidiary of the company  filed for bankruptcy in february ioc s only asset is a platinum catalyst worth approximately and ioc s primary creditor is irlp 
although the company does not believe ioc s bankruptcy will affect the company s estimated cash flow or operations  such may not be the case 
powerine arbitration although the arbitrator has ruled in the company s favor in the powerine arbitration see note to the financial statements and item to this form k and the company believes that it is entitled to additional arbitration proceeds of  mg is disputing the computation and amount of the arbitration award and there can be no assurance that the additional proceeds expected by the company will be received 
the matter remains in arbitration 
larry long litigation the above cash flow estimate does not assume the company will have to pay any claim related to the larry long litigation 
although the sale of the company s oil and gas properties has significantly reduced the company s exposure  there can be no assurance that the plaintiffs will not file new lawsuits  having already amended their original claim three times 
in such case  the company would be exposed to the continuing costs of defending the amended petitions  and  if it is determined that settlement is in the company s best interest  the cost to settle the lawsuit 
no such costs are included in the above estimate of cash flow 
credit risk lone star at the current time  approximately of the company s gas marketing volumes are sold to a single customer  lone star  under a long term gas sale contract  which terminates on may  although lone star has paid for all gas purchased when such payments were due  any inability of lone star to continue to pay for gas purchased would adversely affect the company s cash flow 
supply risk mgng the company now purchases approximately of its gas supplies for the lone star contract from mgng at fixed prices 
if spot gas prices increase significantly and mgng has not hedged its future commitment to supply gas to the company or if mgng experiences financial problems  mgng may be unable to meet its gas supply commitments to the company 
if mgng does not fulfill its gas supply commitment to the company  the company may not be able to fulfill its gas delivery commitment to lone star or to earn the gross margins currently being earned 
this would adversely impact the company s cash flow 
under such circumstances the company may not be able to recover lost profits and cash flow from mgng despite contractual provisions providing for such recovery 
price risk gas supply the company has not hedged or fixed the price on approximately of the gas that it must supply over the next months under its two gas sales contracts 
if gas prices increase or remain high  the company may incur significant losses or reduced gross gas margins when it buys gas at market prices to provide gas for its two gas sales contracts  thus reducing its cash flow from that projected 
gas contract litigation the company s natural gas marketing subsidiaries and mgng are parties to several natural gas contracts 
the provision of such contracts are very complex and it is possible that the company s subsidiaries and mgng may litigate several contractual issues of disagreement 
the outcome of such litigation may impact the above cash flow estimates 
public market for the company s stock although there presently exists a market for the company s stock  such market is volatile and the company s stock is thinly traded 
in addition  the company s earnings history has been sporadic 
although the company believes that its earnings and cash flow will be more predictable in the future  there can be no assurance that such will be the case 
such volatility may adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the company s common stock 
in addition  the company  through its stock repurchase program  has effectively become the major market maker in the company s stock 
if the company ceases repurchasing shares the market value of the company s stock may be adversely affected 
future of the company as noted in note to the financial statements  the company recently sold of its proved oil and gas reserves and its texas pipeline 
the company s primary remaining asset is its gas sales contract with lone star  which expires on may  although the company is seeking investments in the energy sector  including oil and gas properties  the current market is a seller s market and the company may not be able to acquire such investments at a favorable price 
there are also many competitors with resources greater than those of the company 
if the company does not acquire additional assets  its board of directors may decide to pursue other courses of action  including but not limited to liquidation  sale of assets  merger or other reorganization 
year the company has not undergone a comprehensive review of the potential impact of the year change on its operations  financial and accounting systems  however  while there can be no assurances  the company is not aware of any matters at this time that would result in material adverse consequences to the company 
other in addition to the specific risks noted above  the company is subject to general business risks  including insurance claims in excess of insurance coverage  tax liabilities resulting from tax audits  drilling risks that new drilling will result in dry holes or marginal wells and the risks and costs of unending litigation 
inflation and changing prices natural gas marketing the company s gas sales contract with lone star is essentially a fixed price contract 
it continues through may the company s gas supply contract with mgng is also a fixed price contract 
the result is that the company s gross margin is essentially locked in and does not change with inflation 
the company s gas arrangement with uprc is at spot prices 
such spot prices  however  do not change with inflation but do change with the supply and demand for natural gas which does not necessarily parallel inflation 
although there are some operating costs applicable to the natural gas marketing segment  which tend to increase or decrease with inflation  they are minor and inflation of such costs without concomitant inflation in revenues does not significantly impact operating profits 
exploration and production oil and gas sales are determined by markets locally and worldwide and often move inversely to inflation 
whereas operating expenses related to oil and gas sales may be expected to parallel inflation  such costs have often tended to move more in response to oil and gas sales prices than in response to inflation 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no
