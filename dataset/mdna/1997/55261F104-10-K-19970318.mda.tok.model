net interest income lending and funding activities growth in average earning assets  which rose million or to billion in  was the primary factor contributing to a corresponding increase in taxable equivalent net interest income to million in from million in taxable equivalent net interest income and average earning assets in were million and billion  respectively 
the growth in average earning assets in and was predominately attributable to increased demand for loans offered by the company  including the effects of expansion of the company s businesses which provide residential mortgage loans  indirect automobile loans and credit cards 
the accompanying table summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in and percentage changes in the major components of the loan and lease portfolio over the past two years 
loans secured by real estate  excluding million of outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit which are classified as consumer loans  represented approximately of the loan and lease portfolio during  down from in and in at december   the company held approximately billion of commercial real estate loans and billion of consumer real estate loans 
commercial real estate loans originated by the company are predominately secured by properties in the new york city metropolitan area  including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of new york city  and western new york  which includes buffalo  niagara falls  rochester and surrounding areas 
commercial real estate loans are also originated in the hudson valley and southern tier regions of new york state 
most commercial real estate loans originated by the company are fixed rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining principal at maturity  usually five years after loan origination 
for borrowers in good standing  the customer may extend the terms of the loan agreement for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest 
the accompanying table presents commercial real estate loans at december  by geographic area  type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding 
of the billion of commercial real estate loans in the new york city metropolitan area  approximately were secured by multi family residential properties  by office space and by retail space 
the company s experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multi family residential properties 
approximately of the aggregate dollar amount of new york city area loans were for million or less  while loans of more than million were approximately of the total 
commercial real estate loans secured by properties elsewhere in new york state  mostly in western new york  tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business 
approximately of the aggregate dollar amount of loans in this segment of the portfolio were for million or less 
commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of new york state and outside of areas of neighboring states considered to be part of the new york city metropolitan area comprised less than of total commercial real estate loans 
the company normally refrains from commercial construction lending  except when the borrower has obtained a commitment for permanent financing upon project completion 
as a result  the portfolio of commercial construction loans for which the company has not committed to provide permanent financing totaled only million  or 
of total loans and leases at december  the company s portfolio of real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties totaled billion at december   approximately of which were secured by properties located in new york state 
in addition  the company s mortgage banking subsidiary  m t mortgage corporation  had million of residential real estate loans held for sale at december  consumer loans and leases represented approximately of the loan portfolio during  compared with in and in beginning in and  to a greater extent  continuing in and  the company began to market automobile loans and leases and credit cards in areas outside of new york state 
at december   of the automobile loan portfolio was to borrowers outside of new york state  primarily in pennsylvania 
automobile loans and leases are generally originated through dealers  however  all applications submitted by dealers are subject to the company s normal underwriting and loan approval procedures 
during  automobile loans and leases represented approximately of the company s average loan portfolio  while no other consumer loan product represented more than 
credit card accounts are marketed through mail campaigns and co branding initiatives 
such initiatives involve developing relationships with retailers and other enterprises and issuing co branded credit cards that provide cardholders the ability to earn rebates on purchases made with the cards 
the company bears the cost of these rebates 
at december   of outstanding credit card balances were with customers outside of new york state 
the company s portfolio of investment securities averaged billion in  billion in and billion in factors influencing the size of the investment securities portfolio include demand for loans  which generally yield more than investment securities  ongoing repayments  the level of deposits  and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios 
the investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  and shorter term us treasury notes 
when purchasing investment securities  the company considers its overall interest rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to prepayment and other risks assumed 
as a result of changes in interest rates  actual or anticipated prepayments  or credit risk associated with a particular security  the company occasionally sells investment securities 
realized gains or losses from sales of investment securities were negligible in and  but during  the company realized a pre tax gain of approximately million from sales of approximately million of investment securities 
furthermore  to enhance flexibility in managing the investment securities portfolio  and as allowed by the financial accounting standards board fasb  in december the company transferred approximately million of us treasury notes from held to maturity to available for sale classification 
no gain or loss was realized at the time of such transfer 
money market assets  which are comprised of interest bearing deposits at banks  trading account assets  federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities  averaged million in  compared with million in and million in the decline in money market assets from and resulted largely from increased demand for loans 
core deposits represent a significant source of funding to the company and generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities 
such deposits include noninterest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing transaction accounts  savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under  the principal source of core deposits for the company is its new york state branch network 
certificates of deposit under  generated on a nationwide basis by m t bank  na are also included in core deposits 
in  average core deposits rose to billion from billion in core deposits averaged billion in average core deposits of m t bank  na  which began operations in the fourth quarter of  were million in and million in funding provided by core deposits totaled of average earning assets in  compared with in and in an analysis of changes in the components of core deposits is presented in the accompanying table 
the company also obtains funding through domestic time deposits of  or more  deposits originated through the company s offshore branch office  and brokered certificates of deposit 
domestic time deposits over  excluding brokered certificates of deposit  averaged million in compared with million in and million in offshore deposits  comprised primarily of accounts with balances of  or more  averaged million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
brokered deposits averaged billion in  million in  and million in  and totaled billion at december  brokered deposits are used to reduce short term borrowings and lengthen the average maturity of interest bearing liabilities 
the weighted average remaining term to maturity of brokered deposits as of december  was years 
additional amounts of brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time 
in addition to deposits  the company uses short term borrowings from banks  securities dealers  the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb and others as sources of funding 
short term borrowings averaged billion in  billion in and billion in in general  short term borrowings have been used to fund the company s discretionary investments in money market assets and investment securities  and  if necessary  to replace deposit outflows 
additionally  m t bank has issued million of subordinated capital notes  of which million mature in and million mature in although issued primarily to enhance regulatory capital ratios  such notes also provided funding to the company 
net interest income is impacted by changes in the composition of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as described herein  as well as changes in interest rates and spreads 
net interest spread  or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was in  compared with in a greater proportion of loans  which typically yield more than money market assets and investment securities  in the composition of the earning asset portfolio somewhat mitigated a general decrease in market interest rates in compared with as a result  the yield on earning assets decreased slightly to in from in similarly  the cost of interest bearing liabilities also declined  to in from in the net interest spread  yield on earning assets and rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in were  and  respectively 
in  the increase in net interest income resulting from growth in average earning assets was partially offset by the narrowing of the net interest spread 
rising market interest rates throughout much of and had the effect of increasing the cost of the company s interest bearing liabilities more than the yield on earning assets 
largely due to the changes in the net interest spread described herein  the company s net interest margin was in  compared with in and in the contribution to net interest margin of interest free funds  consisting largely of noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity  was 
in  
in and 
in the improvement from resulted largely from increases in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities used to value these funds  supplemented by increases in average interest free funds 
average interest free funds were billion in  billion in and billion in changing interest rates and spreads affect the company s net interest income and net interest margin 
management believes that future changes in market interest rates or the composition of the company s portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads could adversely impact the company s net interest margin and net interest income 
management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under a number of different interest rate scenarios 
as part of the management of interest rate risk  the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of the loan and deposit portfolios 
revenue and expense arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields earned on loans or  as appropriate  the rates paid on interest bearing deposits 
the notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of december  was approximately billion 
in general  under the terms of these swaps  the company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at a fixed rate of interest and makes payments at a variable rate 
however  under terms of a million swap  the company pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate 
the effect of interest rate swaps on the company s net interest income and margin as well as average notional amounts and rates are presented in the accompanying table 
the company estimates that as of december  it would have received approximately million if all interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes were terminated 
this estimated fair value of the interest rate swap portfolio results from the effects of changing interest rates and should be considered in the context of the entire balance sheet and the company s overall interest rate risk profile 
changes in the estimated fair value of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
additional information about interest rate swaps is included in note of notes to financial statements 
during  the fasb issued a proposed statement of financial accounting standards that would significantly change generally accepted accounting for interest rate swaps  other derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
while it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the fasb deliberations regarding the proposal  it is possible that changes in generally accepted accounting principles for these types of transactions and activities could have a material impact on the company s consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of income in future years 
provision for possible credit losses the provision for possible credit losses was million in  compared with million in and million in net charge offs in were million  compared with million in and million in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were 
in  
in and 
in nonaccrual loans totaled million or 
of loans outstanding at december   compared with million or 
a year earlier and million or 
at december  loans past due ninety days or more and accruing interest totaled million at december   up from million a year earlier and million at december  the increase in such past due loans from to resulted primarily from the inclusion at december  of million of one to four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the company and repurchased during from the government national mortgage association 
these loans are covered by guarantees of government agencies 
the costs associated with servicing these loans were reduced as a result of the repurchases 
the total of all nonperforming loan categories was million or 
of loans outstanding at december   compared with million or 
a year earlier and million or 
at december  the allowance for possible credit losses was million or of net loans and leases at the end of  compared with million or at december  and million or at december  the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans was  and at year end  and  respectively 
management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for possible credit losses and records a provision to replenish or build the allowance to a level necessary to maintain an adequate reserve position 
in making such assessment  management performs an ongoing evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio  including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category  the current financial condition of specific borrowers  the economic environment in which borrowers operate  the level of delinquent loans and the value of any collateral 
based upon the results of such review  management believes that the allowance for possible credit losses at december  was adequate to absorb credit losses from existing loans and leases 
a comparative allocation of the allowance for possible credit losses for each of the past five year ends is presented in the accompanying table 
amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based upon management s classification of loans under the company s internal loan grading system and estimates of potential charge offs inherent in each category 
however  as the total reserve is available to absorb losses from any loan category  amounts assigned do not necessarily indicate future losses within these categories 
the unallocated portion of the reserve represents management s assessment of the overall level of credit risk inherent in the loan and lease portfolio over a longer time frame 
the company s credit loss experience is influenced by many factors  including overall economic conditions  in general  and  due to the size of the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio  real estate valuations  in particular 
nonperforming commercial real estate loans totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
at december   million of nonperforming commercial real estate loans were secured by properties located in the new york city metropolitan area  compared with million and million at december  and  respectively

million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net charge offs of consumer loans in were million  or of average consumer loans outstanding  compared with million or 
in and million or 
in higher charge offs of credit card balances and indirect automobile loans were the most significant factors contributing to the increased level of consumer loan charge offs in and net credit card and indirect automobile loan charge offs in were million and million  respectively  compared with million and million  respectively  in in  net credit card and indirect automobile loan charge offs totaled million and million  respectively 
nonperforming consumer loans totaled million or 
of outstanding consumer loans at december   compared with million or 
at december  and million or 
at december  commercial real estate loans secured by multi family properties in the new york city metropolitan area were of loans outstanding at december  the company  however  had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded of total loans outstanding at december  furthermore  the company had no exposure to less developed countries and only million of foreign loans in total 
assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans totaled million at december   compared with million and million at the end of and  respectively 
other income excluding the effect from sales of bank investment securities  other income increased to million in from million in and from million excluding the previously noted million of tax exempt income resulting from the transfer of appreciated investment securities to an affiliated  tax exempt charitable foundation in mortgage banking revenues  which consist of residential mortgage loan servicing fee income  gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights  and other residential mortgage loan related fees  increased to million in from million in and million in revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others were million in  million in and million in gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights increased to million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the million improvement in mortgage banking revenue in from was attributable to growth in the company s residential mortgage servicing business  as well as the january  adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for mortgage servicing rights 
the effect of implementing sfas no 
was to increase mortgage banking revenue and noninterest expense by million and million  respectively 
the company originates residential mortgage loans in new york state  as well as in arizona  colorado  massachusetts  ohio  oregon  utah and washington 
residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
capitalized mortgage servicing rights and excess servicing receivables were million and million  respectively  at december   compared with million and million  respectively  at december  and million and million  respectively  at december  service charges on deposit accounts increased to million in from million in  and from million in trust income of million increased from million in  and from million in merchant discount and other credit card fees in totaled million  compared with million in and million in expansion of the company s credit card business was the primary factor in the improvement 
trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of million in  million in and 
million in other revenues from operations totaled million in  compared with million in and million in excluding the million of tax exempt income related to the transfer of securities to the affiliated foundation 
such amounts include revenues from the sales of mutual funds and annuities of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
other expense other expense totaled million in  compared with million in and million in salaries and employee benefits expenses were million in  an increase of million or from million in factors contributing to the higher personnel expenses were merit salary increases  costs associated with the opening of supermarket banking locations in and the second half of  and the expansion of subsidiaries providing residential mortgage banking services  indirect automobile loans and sales of mutual funds and annuities 
personnel costs in increased million or from million in such increase was due largely to acquisitions  expansion of the residential mortgage banking and securities businesses  and incentive based compensation arrangements 
the number of full time equivalent employees was  at december   up from  and  at december  and  respectively 
nonpersonnel expenses for totaled million  up from million in the increase was largely caused by higher expenses associated with the expansion of businesses providing mortgage banking services  indirect automobile loans  credit cards and the sale of mutual funds and annuities  partially offset by lower deposit insurance expense 
during  the assessment to the company from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic for deposit insurance provided by the bank insurance fund bif was reduced and effective january  was substantially eliminated 
changes in the federal deposit insurance laws were enacted in that required the fdic to impose a one time special assessment to recapitalize the savings association insurance fund saif of the fdic on saif members 
although first empire s bank subsidiaries are bif insured institutions  the company has approximately billion of deposits obtained in so called oakar acquisitions for which deposit insurance premiums are paid to the saif 
included in nonpersonnel expense in is a million charge for the special assessment to recapitalize the saif 
following the recapitalization  the fdic established the saif s assessment rates  which are currently the same as the rates established for bif members 
in addition to deposit insurance fund assessments  in the fdic will assess bif and saif assessable deposits to fund the repayment of debt obligations of the financing corporation fico 
fico is a government agency sponsored entity that was formed to borrow the money necessary to carry out the closing and ultimate disposition of failed thrift institutions by the resolution trust corporation 
under the law  the fdic is required to set fico assessments for bif assessable deposits at one fifth the amount for saif assessable deposits 
the annualized rates established by the fdic for the first half of for bif and saif assessable deposits are basis points and basis points  respectively 
as previously noted  during the company incurred million of charitable contributions expense related to the transfer of securities to a charitable foundation affiliated with the company 
excluding the impact of such contributions expense  which is included in s other costs of operations  nonpersonnel expenses in increased million from higher mortgage banking related expenses and expenses associated with operating entities acquired in late and contributed to the increase 
additionally  in february  the company wrote off million of non marketable securities of nationar  a bank that provided services to financial institutions  which was seized by banking regulators 
income taxes the provision for income taxes in was million  up from million in and million in the effective tax rates were in  in  in a reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre tax income is provided in note of notes to financial statements 
international activities the company s investment in international assets was million and million at december  and  respectively 
total offshore deposits were million and million at december  and  respectively 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity as a financial intermediary  the company is exposed to liquidity risk whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ 
accordingly  a critical element in managing a financial institution is ensuring that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demands for loans and deposit withdrawals  to fund operating expenses  and to be used for other corporate purposes 
the company s core deposits have historically provided a significant source of funds 
such deposits are generated from a large base of consumer  corporate and institutional customers  which over the past several years has become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the company s businesses 
nevertheless  in recent years the company has faced increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of financial market participants  including banks  thrifts  mutual funds  securities dealers and others 
as a result  and consistent with banking industry experience in general  the company has experienced a reduction in the percentage of average earning assets funded by core deposits 
core deposits financed of the company s earning assets at december   compared with and at december  and  respectively 
the company supplements funding from core deposits with various wholesale borrowings  such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and brokered certificates of deposit 
additionally  m t bank and east new york have credit facilities with the fhlb aggregating million  with any borrowings secured by loans and investment securities 
borrowings outstanding under such credit facilities totaled million at december  and million at december  although informal and sometimes reciprocal  sources of funding are also available to the company through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions 
in addition to deposits and borrowings  other sources of liquidity include maturities of money market assets  repayments of loans and investment securities  and cash generated from operations  such as fees collected for services 
first empire s source of funds to pay for operating expenses  dividends and treasury stock repurchases has largely been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries  which are subject to various regulatory limitations 
first empire also maintains a million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank  all of which was available for borrowing at december  management does not anticipate engaging in any activities  either currently or in the long term  which would cause a significant strain on liquidity at either first empire or its subsidiary banks 
furthermore  management closely monitors the company s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs 
net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates 
the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments 
management s philosophy toward positioning the company for interest rate movements is to attempt to limit such variability 
management supplements the modeling technique described above with analyses of market values of on and off balance sheet financial instruments 
as part of managing interest rate risk  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements having an aggregate notional amount of approximately billion at december  information about interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under net interest income lending and funding activities and in note of notes to financial statements 
in accordance with industry practice  the accompanying table presents cumulative totals of net assets liabilities repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames  as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes 
management believes this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor  as assumed in the table  on the contractual maturity or repricing date 
furthermore  this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the company is likely to implement 
the asset liability committee  which includes members of senior management  monitors the company s interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model which considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  as well as statistically derived interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments  including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities 
when deemed prudent  management has taken action  and intends to do so in the future  to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off balance sheet financial instruments 
possible actions include  but are not limited to  changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products  modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and entering into or modifying existing interest rate swap agreements 
giving consideration to interest rate swaps in place at december  and utilizing the model described above  management s assessment is that the variability of net interest income in the next two years may be largely unaffected by changes in interest rates  but that additional interest rate risk management actions may be necessary to counter any detrimental effect which a sustained decrease in interest rates would likely have on net interest income in later years 
capital total stockholders equity at december  was million or of total assets  compared with million or at december  and million or at december  on a per share basis  common stockholders equity was at december   an increase of from at december  and from at december  the ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was  and in  and  respectively 
stockholders equity at december  was reduced by million  or 
per common share  for the net after tax impact of unrealized losses on investment securities classified as available for sale  compared with a reduction of million  or 
per common share  at december  such unrealized losses represent the amount by which amortized cost exceeded the fair value of investment securities classified as available for sale  net of applicable income taxes 
the market valuation of investment securities should be considered in the context of the entire balance sheet of the company 
with the exception of investment securities classified as available for sale  trading account assets and liabilities  and residential mortgage loans held for sale  the carrying values of financial instruments in the balance sheet are generally not adjusted for appreciation or depreciation in market value resulting from changes in interest rates 
cash dividends on common stock of million were paid in  compared with million in and million in the quarterly common stock dividend rate remained at 
per share throughout in total  dividends per common share increased to in from in and in dividends of 
million were paid to the preferred stockholder in  compared with million in and as previously noted  on march   all shares of first empire s convertible preferred stock were converted by the holder of such stock into  shares of first empire common stock at a contractual conversion price of per share 
in november  first empire announced a plan to repurchase and hold as treasury stock up to  shares of common stock for reissuance upon the possible future exercise of outstanding stock options 
as of december   first empire had repurchased  common shares pursuant to such plan at an average cost of per share 
the number of shares repurchased under this plan and another repurchase plan that was completed in were  in   in and  in federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain core capital and total capital ratios of at least and  respectively  of risk adjusted total assets 
in addition to the risk based measures  federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of of the quarterly average of total assets 
under regulatory guidelines  unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale are not recognized in determining regulatory capital 
regulatory capital  however  does include subordinated notes issued by first empire or its subsidiaries 
the capital ratios of the company and its banking subsidiaries  m t bank  east new york and m t bank  na  as of december  are presented in note of notes to financial statements 
on january   first empire completed an offering of trust preferred securities that raised million of capital 
the year offering of fixed rate cumulative trust preferred securities was sold through first empire capital trust i the trust  a delaware business trust that was formed by first empire to facilitate the transaction 
the preferred securities provide investors with call protection for ten years 
the trust was formed solely to issue the trust preferred securities and advance the proceeds to first empire by purchasing first empire s junior subordinated debt 
the proceeds of the trust preferred securities qualify as tier or core capital for first empire under the federal reserve board s risk based capital guidelines 
payments on the junior subordinated debt of first empire  which are in turn passed through the trust to the holders of the preferred securities  will be serviced through existing liquidity and cash flow sources of first empire 
under current federal tax law  first empire will be permitted to deduct interest payments on the junior subordinated debt in computing taxable income 
the company has historically maintained capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory guidelines largely through a high rate of internal capital generation 
the rate of internal capital generation  or net income excluding the after tax effects of gains from sales of investment securities less dividends paid expressed as a percentage of average total stockholders equity  was in  in and in fourth quarter results first empire earned million or per common share in the fourth quarter of  increases of and  respectively  from the fourth quarter of when net income was million or per common share 
on a fully diluted basis  net income per common share was in s final quarter  up from in the year earlier quarter 
taxable equivalent net interest income increased to million in the fourth quarter of  up million from million in the fourth quarter of growth in average loans outstanding was the primary factor contributing to the improvement in net interest income 
average loans for the fourth quarter of totaled billion  a increase from the billion average during the fourth quarter of in total  earning assets averaged billion in the final quarter of  up from billion in the corresponding quarter 
the yield on earning assets decreased to in the final quarter from in the year earlier period  while the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to from 
the resulting net interest spread was in the recent quarter  compared with in the fourth quarter of similarly  net interest margin increased  to in the fourth quarter of from in the year earlier quarter 
the provision for possible credit losses was million in the final quarter  compared with million in the fourth quarter of net charge offs totaled million in s fourth quarter  up from million in the year earlier quarter  largely due to higher net charge offs of consumer loans  which increased to million in the final quarter from million in the fourth quarter of net charge offs as an annualized percentage of average loans and leases were 
in the recent quarter  up from 
in the corresponding quarter 
excluding the effects of investment securities transactions  other income rose to million in the fourth quarter of from million in the year earlier quarter 
higher revenues associated with credit card activities and the sales of mutual funds and annuities contributed to this increase 
other expense was million in the fourth quarter of  compared with million in the fourth quarter of expansion of businesses providing credit cards  indirect automobile loans and the sale of mutual funds and annuities were factors contributing to the rise in expenses over the comparable prior year period
