the decrease also reflects the full year effect of the application of the proceeds from the company s initial public offering to reduce the company s debt

income tax expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to for the year ended from for the year ended  primarily due to the company discontinuing the non deductible portion of reimbursements to drivers for meals and other expenses 
as a result of the preceding changes  the company s net income as a percentage of operating revenue was in as compared to in liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business has required a significant investment in new revenue equipment 
the company s primary source of liquidity has been funds provided by operations  term borrowings to finance equipment purchases and the company s line of credit  and the company s initial and secondary public offerings in and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures for the purchase of revenue equipment  office equipment and leasehold improvements totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures  net of trade ins  will be approximately million for  to be used primarily to acquire new revenue equipment to expand the company s fleet  to upgrade existing facilities  and to acquire additional facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities and net direct equipment financing was approximately million for the year ended december  and net cash used in financing activities and net direct equipment financing was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this change was due to the company s ability to offset the cost of purchasing revenue equipment with the proceeds of the company s secondary stock offering 
the company maintains a million revolving line of credit with its lender and uses that line to finance the acquisition of revenue equipment and other corporate purposes to the extent the cost of such acquisitions is not provided by funds from operations 
under the company s line of credit  the company is obligated to comply with certain financial covenants 
the rate of interest on borrowings against the line of credit will vary depending upon the interest rate election made by the company  based on either the london interbank offered rate libor plus  the prime rate  or the lender s certificate of deposit rate plus 
at december  and march   the company had no borrowings under its revolving line of credit 
management believes that the cash flow from operating activities and available borrowing will be sufficient to meet the company s capital needs through the next months 
the company will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  which may require the company to incur debt or seek additional equity capital in the future 
the availability of this capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions  the market price of the common stock and other factors over which the company has no control  as well as the company s financial condition and results of operations 
seasonality to date  the company s revenue has not shown any significant seasonal pattern 
because the company operates primarily in arizona  california and the western united states  winter weather generally has not adversely affected the company s business 
expansion of the company s operations in the midwest  on the east coast  and in the texas and louisiana regions could expose the company to greater operating variances due to seasonal weather in these regions 
inflation many of the company s operating expenses  including fuel costs and fuel taxes  are sensitive to the effects of inflation  which could result in higher operating costs 
the effects of inflation on the company s business during  and generally were not significant 
recently issued accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of accounting financial standard no 
 sfas no 
earnings per share  which established a new accounting principle for accounting for earnings per share 
the standard is effective for fiscal year ended december  when adopted  sfas no 
will require restatement of prior years earnings per share 
the company has not yet determined the impact sfas no 
will have on its financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results the company anticipates an increase in licensing costs of between one half expected to one percent due primarily to increased licensing expenses in california and expected increases in the company s revenue equipment 
the company believes that these increased costs will be partially offset by other items 
a number of factors over which the company has little or no control may affect the company s future results 
fuel prices  insurance costs  liability claims  interest rates  the availability of qualified drivers  fluctuations in the resale value of revenue equipment and customers business cycles and shipping demands are economic factors over which the company has little or no control 
significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates or increases in insurance costs or liability claims  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates  would reduce the company s profitability 
although the company s independent contractors are responsible for paying for their own equipment  fuel and other operating costs  significant increases in these costs could cause them to seek higher compensation from the company or other contractual opportunities 
difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers or a downturn in customers business cycles or shipping demands also could have a material adverse effect on the growth and profitability of the company 
if a shortage of drivers should occur in the future the company could be required to adjust its driver compensation package  which could affect the company s profitability if not offset by an increase in rates 
the company s growth has been made possible through the addition of new revenue equipment 
difficulty in financing or obtaining new revenue equipment for example  delivery delays could restrict future growth 
if the resale value of the company s revenue equipment were to decline  the company could be forced to retain some of its equipment longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses for maintenance and repairs 
the company has experienced significant and rapid growth in revenue and profits since the inception of its business in there can be no assurance that the company s business will continue to grow in a similar fashion in the future or that the company can effectively adapt its management  administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of the company s business or by changes in economic conditions 
at this time a significant portion of the company s business is concentrated in the arizona and california markets and a general economic decline or a natural disaster in either of these markets could have a material adverse effect on the growth and profitability of the company 
if the company is successful in deriving a significant portion of its revenues from markets in the texas and louisiana regions and the midwest and on the east coast in the near future  its growth and profitability could be materially adversely affected by general economic declines or natural disasters in those markets 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and business operations and marketing and customers 
the company has recently established operations near houston  texas to provide dedicated services to one of its larger customers and to commence regional service in the texas and louisiana regions and recently initiated operations in indianapolis  indiana  in order to access markets in the midwest and on the east coast 
these operations will require the commitment of additional revenue equipment and personnel  as well as management resources  for future development 
these initiatives represent the first established operations of the company in markets outside of its primary regional operations in the western united states 
should the growth in the company s operations near houston  texas or in indianapolis  indiana slow or stagnate  the results of company operations could be adversely affected 
the company may encounter operating conditions in these new markets that differ substantially from those previously experienced in its western united states markets 
there can be no assurance that the company s regional operating strategy as employed in the western united states can be duplicated successfully or that it will not take longer than expected or require a more substantial financial commitment than anticipated in order for the company to generate positive operating results in these new markets
