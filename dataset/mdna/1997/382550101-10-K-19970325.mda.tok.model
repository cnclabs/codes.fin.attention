worldwide tire unit sales were higher than and higher than  and sales of other automotive and industrial rubber products were higher in both and tire unit sales in rose on higher volume in europe and asia  although original equipment volume decreased in north america and latin america 
in  tire unit sales reflected higher original equipment volume  primarily in europe  but were adversely affected by lower replacement auto market volume in the us revenues in decreased despite higher tire unit sales  due primarily to continued competitive pricing pressures worldwide and the strengthening of the us dollar in versus various foreign currencies 
competitive pricing pressures are expected to continue worldwide during revenues in increased due to higher average selling prices and the favorable impact of the strengthening of european currencies in versus the us dollar 
cost of goods sold in was of sales  compared to in and in raw material costs in decreased from the level reached after s significant increase in natural rubber prices  and worldwide raw material costs are not expected to increase significantly in labor costs increased in both and  due in part to the us wage agreements which provided for wage and benefit improvements 
future labor costs are uncertain due to the expiration of these agreements in manufacturing costs in and benefited from efficiencies achieved as a result of ongoing cost containment measures  but were adversely affected in by lower levels of capacity utilization resulting from reductions in production schedules in north america and europe to align inventory with market requirements 
the company s research and development expenditures  all of which were included in cost of sales  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
research and development expenditures in are expected to approximate levels 
selling  administrative and general expense sag in was of sales  compared to in and in the improvement as a percent to sales in each year reflected lower employment levels which reduced compensation and benefit costs in the us  and the benefits of ongoing cost containment measures 
in december  industry developments occurred indicating that the quantities of off shore california  onshore california and alaska north slope crude oil expected to be tendered in the future to the all american pipeline system and related assets the system for transportation would be below prior estimates and that volumes of crude oil expected to be tendered to the system for transportation to markets outside of california in the future would be significantly lower than previously anticipated 
as a result  management determined that the future cash flows expected to be generated by the system would be less than its carrying value 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company reduced the carrying value of the system to million  determined using the present value of expected future cash flows from the system  and recorded a charge of million million after tax or per share

dollars in millions consolidated debt    debt debt equity the company actively manages its fixed and floating rate debt mix  within defined limitations  using refinancings and unleveraged interest rate swaps 
the company will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce the company s risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates 
interest rate swap contracts are thus used by the company to separate interest rate risk management from the debt funding decision

average rate paid during the year average rate received during the year current market pricing models were used to estimate the fair values of interest rate swap contracts 
the fair value of the fixed rate contracts improved from million unfavorable at december   due primarily to the absence of contracts which matured in the company estimates that a basis point decrease in interest rates at december  would have adversely affected the fair value of the fixed rate contracts by million and improved the fair value of the floating rate contracts by million at that date

the company pays a commitment fee ranging from to basis points on the entire amount of the commitment and a usage fee of to basis points on amounts borrowed 
the million day credit facility agreement provides that the company may borrow until july   on which date the facility commitment terminates  except as it may be extended on a bank by bank basis
