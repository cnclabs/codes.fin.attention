item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations sales for fiscal gradually increased for the first three quarters of the year 
fourth quarter sales dropped significantly from the third quarter due to decreased customer requirements  however  the company was able to maintain profitability for all four quarters of the year 
although the company won several new programs in fiscal  shipments in volume with associated revenues are not expected to commence until the last half of fiscal annual unit sales increased by compared to fiscal  but the average selling price asp decreased by from the prior year 
these statistics present very clearly the challenges facing the company 
although unit sales continue to increase each year  market pressures command lower and lower prices 
since the company s niche in the marketplace depends on its ability to satisfy customer requirements  there is a continuing emphasis on cost control as new and improved keyboard models are designed 
the company s facility in juarez  mexico has proven to be a tremendous asset in this continuing struggle  and it was expanded during the fiscal year to better enable it to meet increased production demands 
further restructuring of the facility in dundalk  ireland became necessary in fiscal and a charge of million was recorded for anticipated costs associated with this continued downsizing 
the company s gross profit percentage increased 
to compared to fiscal fiscal year started out very strong with first quarter sales in excess of million and net income of million 
however  various market driven events began to negatively impact sales beginning in the second quarter 
second quarter sales declined to million and sales were down to million for the third quarter 
although there was some recovery in the fourth quarter of the year  sales volume did not recover to the levels reached in the first and second quarter 
during the fourth quarter  it became apparent that to remain competitive in the european marketplace  the company would need to scale down its manufacturing facility in dundalk  ireland and fill excess capacity in its juarez manufacturing facility 
restructuring activities were implemented during the quarter and a charge of million was recorded to reflect the estimated costs associated with this restructuring see note to the june  consolidated financial statements 
unit sales increased by compared to fiscal while average selling price asp declined by 
gross profit percentage decreased by to in compared to risks and uncertainties that may affect future results the following risks and uncertainties could affect the company s actual results and could cause results to differ materially from past results or those contemplated by the company s forward looking statements 
when used herein  the words expects  believes  anticipates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary in the future due to a variety of factors  including changes in overall demand for computer products  success of customers programs  timing of new programs  new product introductions or technological advances by the company  its customers and its competitors and changes in pricing policies by the company  its customers and its competitors 
for example  the company relies on customers forecasts to plan its business 
if those forecasts are overly optimistic  the company s revenues and profits may fall short of expectations 
conversely  if those forecasts are too conservative  the company could have an unexpected increase in revenues and profits 
competition the keyboard and other input device industry is intensely competitive 
most of the company s principal competitors are headquartered in asian countries that have a low cost labor force 
those competitors may be able to offer customers lower prices on certain high volume programs 
this could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  all of which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  competitors can copy the company s non proprietary designs after the company has invested in development of products for customers  thereby enabling such competitors to offer lower prices on such products due to savings in development costs 
concentration of major customers at present  the company s customer base is highly concentrated  and there can be no assurance that its customer base will not become more concentrated 
three of the company s oem customers accounted for  and individually  of net sales during fiscal in  these same customers accounted for   and of the company s net sales 
there can be no assurance that the company s principal customers will continue to purchase products from the company at current levels 
moreover  the company typically does not enter into long term volume purchase contracts with its customers  and the company s customers have certain rights to extend or delay the shipment of their orders 
the loss of one or more of the company s major customers or the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from such customers could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing and management personnel and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
litigation the company currently is a party to ninety three lawsuits brought by computer keyboard users in state and federal courts 
these lawsuits allege that specific keyboard products manufactured by the company were sold with manufacturing  design and warning defects which caused or contributed to the claimants alleged injuries  generally referred to as repetitive stress injuries rsi or cumulative trauma disorders ctd 
the company believes it has valid defenses to these claims  and it will vigorously defend them 
these lawsuits are in the early stages of discovery 
at this time  management believes that it is not likely that the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
however  given the limited information currently available  the complexity of the litigation  the inherent uncertainty of litigation and the ultimate resolution of insurance coverage issues  management s position will change if warranted by facts and circumstances 
technological change and new product risk the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and relatively short product life cycles 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
the company s success will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address evolving and increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
failure to do so could substantially harm the company s competitive position 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying  developing  manufacturing and marketing products that respond to technological change  emerging industry standards or evolving customer requirements 
dilution and stock price volatility as of june   there were outstanding options and warrants for the purchase of approximately  shares of common stock of the company common stock  of which options and warrants for approximately  shares were vested and exercisable 
holders of the common stock will suffer immediate and substantial dilution to the extent outstanding options and warrants to purchase the common stock are exercised 
the stock price of the company may be subject to wide fluctuations and possible rapid increases or declines over a short time period 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company such as variations in quarterly operating results or changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors relating to the computer industry or to the securities markets in general  which  in recent years  have experienced significant price fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded
