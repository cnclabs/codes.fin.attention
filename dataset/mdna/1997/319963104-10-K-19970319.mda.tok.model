item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations first data corporation fdc or the company operates in a single business segment providing high quality  high volume information processing and related services to several market sectors 
the company has focused particularly on its services related to payment transactions which include transaction card issuer services  merchant card and check processing services  and processing services related to payment instruments  representing approximately two thirds of fdc s operating revenues in both and in this area  the company is emphasizing growth in electronic commerce  information management and international expansion 
the company continues to pursue revenue growth through five primary sources internal growth  which consists primarily of increased transaction processing for existing clients  sales of ancillary products and enhanced services to existing clients  the addition of new clients in existing service areas  expansion into adjacent markets where fdc can provide similar information processing services to new client groups  and acquisitions 
fdc continues to consider acquisition opportunities as well as other forms of business combinations and divestitures 
acquisitions supplement fdc s internal efforts to access new markets and client groups  while divestitures are contemplated for business units lacking sufficient growth prospects or for units not enhancing the company s transaction processing competencies 
however  no assurance can be given with respect to the timing  likelihood or the financial or business effect of any possible transaction 
strategic transactions and developments during  the company substantially completed the integration of first financial management corporation s ffmc operations with those of fdc 
the october merger of the two companies was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and the results of the two entities have been combined for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and in this discussion and analysis 
in addition  the company divested its moneygram operation in december through an initial public offering of its common stock to comply with the company s agreement with the federal trade commission ftc as part of the merger with ffmc 
moneygram represented approximately of consolidated operating revenues and pretax earnings 
the company formed first data solutions in from its information management businesses to enhance current product and service offerings to the company s existing and potential clients 
subsequent product expansion occurred through the company s acquisition of donnelley marketing  inc  a consumer information and direct marketing firm  in september and a public record information business in june these business combinations were accounted for as purchases  and their results have been included from the effective dates of each acquisition 
in addition  the company introduced the u a value exchange product which offers its merchant base the opportunity for targeted promotional programs to the cardholders of fdc s issuing bank clients 
during  fdc implemented a number of additional alliance programs with bank clients 
the alliances are designed to preserve each bank s existing merchant relationships while allowing both fdc and the bank to share in profit opportunities with respect to the existing merchant business of both fdc and the bank  namely in the form of cost efficiencies and expanded product offerings 
the structure of the alliances varies depending on the needs of each bank client and fdc  as well as applicable tax  regulatory and other considerations  however  each alliance involves the bank and fdc contributing some of their merchant contracts  cash or a combination thereof 
additionally  cost efficiencies and product offerings have benefited the alliances in generating new merchant business 
in the fourth quarter  the company also entered into several agreements enhancing its merchant processing area  the most significant being with wal mart and chase manhattan bank chase 
the company entered into a year agreement with wal mart to process all of its electronic payments 
in addition  use of the company s check acceptance product  which is currently used by certain wal mart locations  will be expanded 
the company entered into an agreement with chase to form an alliance which initially will focus principally on national level merchants 
this venture is expected to become operational in the first quarter of in the payment instruments area  the company acquired the remaining outside interest in the western union mexican money transfer business 
during  the company also acquired two fleet service operations which offers the trucking industry various types of payment products 
these acquisitions offered an adjacent market for the company s payment services 
the company continues to scrutinize its businesses and their related fit into fdc s long term plans 
during the past few years  fdc completed the sale of several business units the company s moneygram operations as discussed above  the company s health systems business in june and its cable billing services and hotel reservations businesses in november in february  the company completed the sale of its genex subsidiary 
genex was a division of the company s health care administration services area and performs workers compensation cost containment and management services 
the remainder of the health care administration services area has experienced a decline in business levels over the past year as fdc has shifted away from government related and other low margin products  and focused on data processing and information management related to employee claims and the resulting payment  including completing the development of a new claims administration processing system  act  for which the company has incurred capitalized software development costs of million at december  act has been in development for several years 
this development is entering the critical period of operational implementation and planned roll out to many existing customers as well as new clients in during the third quarter  the company s board of directors declared a two for one stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend  distributed on november  to shareholders of record on november  accordingly  all earnings loss per common share amounts and related share amounts have been retroactively restated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and in this discussion and analysis 
results of operations compared with operating revenues in increased to billion  compared with billion in the prior year 
the company s internal growth rate in revenues over the prior year excluding the effect of acquisitions and divested businesses was approximately 
growth in existing businesses  principally due to the addition of new clients along with strong underlying volume increases from existing clients and enhanced services to such clients  accounted for a substantial majority of the revenue increase 
the company s performance reflects  in particular  continuing strong growth in the payment instruments  merchant processing  and domestic card issuer services business areas 
a substantial portion of the company s operating revenues is generated from payment and other transactions occurring entirely within the united states 
transactions outside the united states arise principally within the company s card services operation in the united kingdom  and from nonbank money transfers settled outside the united states  but originating and processed within the united states 
both of these international transaction volume sources had double digit growth in the company derives revenues in its primary service areas principally based on the number of accounts or transactions processed  a percentage of dollar volume processed  or on a combination thereof 
lesser amounts of revenue are generated from foreign currency exchange on money transfer transactions and from sharing in investment earnings on fiduciary funds 
these payment instrument investment revenues from fiduciary funds before commissions to certain selling agents increased from million in to million in the overall growth of fdc is demonstrated by the following key indicators along with the percentage growth compared to million card accounts on file at december   billion merchant transactions and million payment instrument transactions  excluding moneygram money transfers operating expenses increased to billion from billion in the percentage increase was less than the operating revenue percentage increase for the year  reversing the trend when operating expenses for the year rose at a rate of four percentage points higher than operating revenue growth 
this reversal primarily was due to high growth in certain business areas which have a lower ratio of operating expenses to revenue than the overall company average and the benefits of integration activities which have slowed the rate of growth in operating expenses 
these positive benefits were somewhat offset by the continued impact of signing certain new business and renewing larger customers at lower rates and the impact of a ffmc health care acquisition in october prior to ffmc s merger with the company  which has relatively higher operating expenses compared with its revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  up from million in the increase is associated principally with the company s efforts to attract customers and increase business levels by devoting resources and expenditures to marketing and advertising programs for the company s businesses  including its alliance programs with banks for its merchant processing services 
general and administrative increases for the year  which were driven primarily by the merchant processing business and certain acquisitions  substantially were offset by synergy savings from the merger with ffmc 
interest expense increased modestly despite increased borrowing levels  principally due to reduced costs related to assumed pension obligations in connection with the western union acquisition which has been classified as interest expense since it is a suspended plan for which service credits are no longer being earned by participants 
in addition  the company currently is experiencing lower rates due to the short term rate environment and use of its commercial paper program 
earnings comparisons between and are impacted significantly by merger  integration and impairment amounts 
the merger  integration and impairment amount consists of a million gain on the sale of the company s moneygram operation through an initial public offering of of its common stock 
this divestiture was ordered by the ftc as part of the ffmc merger 
in addition  the amount includes million of integration and impairment charges 
these items  net  increased after tax income by million per share 
the million merger  integration and impairment charge included million in direct costs of the ffmc merger  primarily payments pursuant to preexisting change in control agreements with ffmc management 
as a result of the ffmc merger  the company conducted a strategic reevaluation of its businesses  reviewing overall trends and developments in relation to its business investments and industry concentrations 
in addition to identifying duplicate and overlapping operations  this process identified certain insignificant business lines for disposition or discontinuance and highlighted other business lines and customer relationships which had diminished future value 
as a result  the company recorded restructuring and integration costs of million and impairment charges of million 
the impairment charge included a million write off of envoy goodwill caused by the subsequent agreements that added ces and nabanco to fdc s operations 
these additions caused the company not to pursue the business plans driving the assumptions used to originally value envoy in august when the agreement to acquire envoy was executed 
finally  the charge included a million expense related to the prepayment of certain long term borrowings 
after considering tax benefits of only million due to the nondeductibility of certain items  the charge reduced after tax earnings by million per share 
for a more complete description of these charges  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding merger  integration and impairment amounts and the second quarter impact of the divestiture of the health systems business which produced a pretax gain of million and offsetting income taxes of million  pretax income for the year was  million  up from s million 
pretax margins  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in from in this margin improvement indicates the ongoing realization of synergies  cost containment efforts and operating efficiencies 
in addition  margin improvements were experienced in the merchant processing area due to the increased number of alliances accounted for under the equity method and in the payment instruments area due to strong transaction growth in high margin products 
these improvements partially were offset by a decline in margin in the company s health care administration business 
fdc s effective income tax rate of in decreased from in excluding the impact of the merger  integration and impairment charge and the health systems divestiture discussed above due to increased earnings from nontaxable investments of settlement assets  partially offset by an increase in state taxes as a larger percentage of business was conducted in states with higher tax rates than the company s prior average rate 
after tax earnings increased from a net loss of million in to a net income of million in excluding merger  integration and impairment amounts in both years  after tax earnings increased to million in from million in earnings per common share again excluding the above amounts in both years increased to in compared with per share in the lower percentage increase in per share earnings compared with after tax earnings principally results from the issuance of common stock during to complete business combinations 
compared with operating revenues in increased to billion  compared with billion in the prior year 
growth in existing businesses  principally from new clients and strong underlying volume increases from existing clients  accounted for approximately half of the revenue increase 
the balance of the growth in operating revenues primarily resulted from the effect of acquisitions  net of the impact of revenue lost from divested businesses 
growth in existing businesses was particularly strong in the company s card issuer and merchant processing as well as payment instrument services  with these service groups experiencing internal revenue growth exceeding compared with the prior year 
other service areas experienced various lower growth rates or declines in revenue  in certain instances either as a result of product development cycles or a deemphasis of certain aspects of the business 
expenses excluding s merger  integration and impairment charge of million increased  slightly higher than the rate of increase of operating revenues 
operating expenses increased by primarily due to outlays to expand facilities and increase staffing to grow the company s infrastructure 
selling  general and administrative expenses grew at a lesser rate of 
accordingly  income before income taxes excluding the merger  integration and impairment charge and the impact of the divestiture of the health systems business as previously discussed increased to million in compared with million in the company s pretax margin on total revenues of in  down from in due to the company s infrastructure expenses incurred and the impact of pricing for larger clients in fdc s effective income tax rate of in increased from in principally from the nondeductibility of a large portion of the merger  integration and impairment charge 
excluding the impact of the charge on s rate  the company s effective income tax rate increased in to  primarily from the impact of million in taxes a tax rate on the gain from the sale of the company s health systems business 
excluding the health systems divestiture  fdc s effective rate in of decreased from in due primarily to increased earnings from nontaxable investments of settlement assets 
after tax earnings decreased from million in to a net loss of million in as a result of the merger  integration and impairment charge  which impacted per share amounts in a similar manner 
excluding the impact of the charge  after tax earnings increased to million from million in earnings per common share again excluding the merger  integration and impairment charge increased to in compared with per share in economic fluctuations fdc s business is somewhat insulated from economic fluctuations due to recurring service revenues from long term relationships  and the fact that the company s services often result in cost savings for its customers 
in addition  its card issuing and merchant processing service areas are benefiting from higher overall card use and  in particular  growing card use for recurring transactions at outlets such as supermarkets and gas stations 
portions of the company s business are seasonal 
fdc s revenues and earnings are favorably affected by increased card and check volume during the holiday shopping period in the fourth quarter and  to a lesser extent  during the back to school buying period in the third quarter 
higher money transfer volume during the summer months in fdc s payment instruments area also affects revenues and earnings 
although fdc cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on its operations  the company has not been significantly affected by inflation 
for the most part  the company has looked to operating efficiencies from scale and technology  as well as decreases in technology and communications costs to offset increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses 
in addition  a portion of fdc s service revenues are based on a percentage of dollar volume processed  partially insulating operating margins on these services from the effects of inflation 
forward looking statement the company has a long term objective to grow revenues  net income and earnings per share at a compound annual rate of approximately 
growth in any one year may be modestly above or below this objective  reflecting changes in business mix  investment in future growth opportunities  and or acquisition activities 
in  first data expects earnings per share to be approximately 
earnings of per share would result in a five year compound annual growth rate of approximately since the initial public offering in the company expects earnings growth in the first half of to be slightly lower  and in the second half to be slightly higher  than the year as a whole due to the timing of revenues and expenses related to new client and product initiatives 
all forward looking statements are inherently uncertain as they are based on various expectations and assumptions concerning future events and they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected 
important factors upon which the company s forward looking statements are premised include the following 
continued growth at rates approximating recent levels for card based payment transactions  consumer money transfer transactions  and other product markets 

successful implementation of the act health care claims administration processing system into the company s existing customer base as well as overall market appeal for the service 

successful implementation and achievement of expected growth of the u a value exchange program and other information product initiatives 

absence of consolidation among client financial institutions or other client groups which has a significant impact on fdc client relationships 

successful management of pricing pressures through cost efficiencies 

no imposition of a value added tax on third party credit card processing services by the european community  which could put credit card processing outsourcers at a competitive disadvantage to in house solutions in the european community 

no unanticipated changes in laws  regulations  credit card association rules or other industry standards affecting fdc s businesses which require significant product redevelopment efforts or render products obsolete 

no dispositions of significant businesses  which could have a short term dilutive impact if other appropriate investment opportunities are not immediately available 

continuation of the existing interest rate environment  avoiding increases in agent fees related to a portion of the company s payments instruments business and in the company s short term borrowing costs 

absence of significant changes in retail foreign exchange spreads on retail money transfer transactions  particularly between the united states and mexico 

no significant increase in the cost of maintaining a role for fdc s credit card processing  merchant processing and money transfer businesses in connection with new payment technologies being developed 

successfully managing the potential both for patent protection and patent liability in the context of rapidly developing legal framework for expansive software patent protection 
variations from these assumptions or failure to achieve these objectives could cause actual results to differ from those projected in the forward looking statement 
due to the uncertainties inherent in forward looking statements  readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these statements 
in addition  fdc undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of unanticipated events  or changes to projections over time 
capital resources and liquidity fdc continues to generate significant cash flow from operations  aggregating  million in this cash flow was produced principally from million of net income and million of non cash depreciation and amortization expense 
working capital items principally accounts receivable  accounts payable and income taxes did not use cash as the deferral of income tax payments offset the increase in receivables associated with the overall revenue growth of the business 
fdc utilized this cash flow to reinvest in its existing businesses  to meet its dividend requirements  to fund purchases of treasury shares and to contribute to the financing of business expansion 
cash flow from operations in exceeded the comparable amount by million 
due to the merger  integration and impairment charge not using a large amount of cash  this increase is significantly different than the increase in net income between the two periods 
fdc reinvests cash in its existing businesses primarily to expand its processing capabilities through property and equipment additions and to establish customer processing relationships through initial contract payments and costs for conversion and systems development 
these cash outlays totaled million in compared with million in the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to the company s expansion of its overall processing capacity to continue to meet growing transaction volumes and the conversion of new customers onto the company s processing systems 
the company expects that these outlays will be slightly lower in due to investment in the company s processing systems 
in  the company also expects to expense approximately million of expenditures in connection with preparing its processing systems to handle the year issues 
overall  fdc s operating cash flow in exceeded its non acquisition investing activities by million 
the company also received cash of million during relating to dispositions  which is primarily attributable to the december divestiture of moneygram  proceeds from the formation of joint ventures in furtherance of fdc s bank alliance program and the sale of a retail credit card receivables portfolio 
these cash sources contributed to funds utilized for acquisitions and treasury stock purchases 
during  the company invested million of cash in several acquisitions and ongoing investments in the bank alliance program 
a million payment was made in the first quarter to purchase the remaining interest in a joint venture relating to western union s money transfer services between the us and mexico 
in the third quarter  a million payment was made to purchase donnelley marketing  inc  a consumer information and direct marketing firm 
the remainder consists principally of payments relating to the company s alliance programs with bank clients involving merchant business  and two acquisitions which expanded the company s markets and service offerings in its payment instruments business 
the company s financing activities include net borrowings  share repurchases  and dividend payments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  as compared to million in the significant decline is due to lower net borrowings million in versus million in and higher net share repurchase activity 
during  the company issued million in medium term notes with maturities ranging from two to five years  reducing its dependence on short term borrowings 
the proceeds from these notes were used to reduce outstanding commercial paper  which declined from million at december  to million at december  also the company obtained million in uncommitted bank lines from several financial institutions during  under which million was outstanding at december  the company made cash outlays totaling million in to buy back shares of its common stock which were reissued primarily in connection with the company s stock compensation plans 
proceeds from option exercises and related tax benefits of million partially offset these outlays 
in addition  fdc continued its pattern of paying quarterly cash dividends of per share to the company s common stockholders  resulting in cash outlays totaling million and million in and  respectively 
following the november stock split  the company increased the fourth quarter dividend to per share which was paid in january as an integral part of fdc s information processing services for payment transactions  fdc receives funds from instruments sold in advance of settlement with payment recipients 
these funds referred to as settlement assets on fdc s consolidated balance sheets are not utilized to support the company s operations 
however  the company does have the opportunity to earn income from investing a portion of these funds 
the company maintains a portion of its settlement assets in highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents within settlement assets to fund settlement obligations 
the company uses conventional interest rate swap and cap agreements off balance sheet to partially hedge specific exposures related to certain commission expenses of its payment instruments business which are tied to short term variable rates 
the impact of these instruments is not material to the company s overall financial position or results of operations 
a more detailed description of these financial instruments is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company held cash and cash equivalents of million  an increase of over s million 
these amounts include million related to required investments in connection with the company s merchant card settlement operations  additional amounts used to support the operations of certain business units  and the remainder available for general corporate purposes 
also  fdc has available short term borrowing capability of million at december  under the company s commercial paper program and through its uncommitted credit lines 
in addition  at december  the company had an outstanding shelf registration statement providing for the future issuance of debt and equity securities up to million in the aggregate 
the company believes that its current level of cash and borrowing capability along with future cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet the needs of its existing businesses 
however  to achieve its objectives  the company may  when necessary  supplement its available cash resources by seeking funds in the equity or debt markets 
to provide additional flexibility  the company anticipates expanding its existing commercial paper program to billion and has been authorized by its board of directors to file an additional million shelf registration
