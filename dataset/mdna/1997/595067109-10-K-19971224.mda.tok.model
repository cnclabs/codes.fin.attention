item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the discussions of results of operations as well as liquidity and capital resources are grouped as follows continuing operations consolidated represents the consolidated data of microdyne corporation and its two continuing divisions 
aerospace telemetry represents microdyne s operations related to the development and manufacture of telemetry receivers  the specialized high frequency radios used in aerospace and satellite communications 
the products and system integration services provided by aerospace telemetry serve the needs of the aerospace industry  satellite communications providers  and other users of high precision  high reliability long range monitoring and control equipment 
the microdyne aerospace telemetry division atd is located in ocala  florida 
the aerospace telemetry market in which microdyne competes is in the midst of a growth cycle 
according to the us bureau of the census  the defense electronics and communications equipment industries  of which aerospace telemetry is a part  grew at a combined rate of to billion between calendar year end and based on manufacturing factory shipments 
the growth in aerospace telemetry is due to the launching or planned launch of a new generation of satellites  a desire for more data from vehicles being tested via telemetry coupled with increased ability to process and evaluate such data  and an expansion of educational and international opportunities 
microdyne has developed and is marketing products and services to serve these audiences 
microdyne is also in the process of developing new products and expanding the breadth of its services to these markets 
outsourced support services represents microdyne s operations as a provider of outsourcing support services 
outsourcing support services provides trained technical staff and management of telephone technical support centers  in warranty and after warranty repair services  and special project staffing

the outsourcing industry  of which the microdyne s outsourcing support services division is a part  is experiencing rapid growth 
according to market research conducted by microdyne  sales in the telephone technical support industry more than doubled in the period between and  for a compounded annual growth rate of 
such growth is a result of organizations desire to control costs  constrain headcount  and generally focus human and financial resources on activities that will produce higher rates of return 
as companies focus on their core business processes  many are choosing to outsource those services in which they do not have a core competency 
microdyne believes its core competency in the field of outsourced telephone technical support  in warranty and after warranty repair and special projects staffing can serve as a template for becoming a provider of high quality outsourced services to other customers  though it can provide no assurances of success

sales for the aerospace telemetry division increased as a result of the improved demand for the division s product line and its system integration services 
systems integration revenue for aerospace telemetry  in particular  grew from approximately million in to approximately million in  principally as the result of a large systems integration contract with the italian ministry of defense

negotiations on the sale of the division s assets and on the reduction of certain of the division s liabilities  have been substantially completed 
at present  the remaining liabilities of the discontinued operations are not expected to be assumed by the proposed buyers of the division s assets  and will therefore continue to be assumed by microdyne 
while microdyne has entered into agreements through which the divisions assets have been sold  certain amounts to be realized by microdyne from these agreements are contingent upon future events  whose outcome is not certain 
however  management continues to believe that the amounts estimated for the loss on disposal of the discontinued operations are adequate based upon the presently available information 
the condensed statement of operations relating to the discontinued operations for the years ended october   september  and september  are presented below 
in thousands revenue    costs and expenses    income loss before income taxes    income tax provision benefit    net income loss    liquidity and capital resources during the past three years  microdyne has financed its operations principally through internally generated funds

in addition  microdyne believes that the previously mentioned borrowing agreements will be renewed or replaced 
in april  microdyne utilized cash and notes to purchase from novell  inc novell the exclusive  royalty free perpetual right to market certain hardware and related technology which were previously sold by microdyne under license from novell  and to convert certain accounts payable into notes payable 
as of september   notes payable due novell totaled million  of which million has been classified as a short term obligation and million as a long term obligation on the september  balance sheet 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operations was million  primarily due to cash provided by discontinued operations of million 
increases in accounts receivable  inventories and deferred taxes were mostly offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses as well as earnings from continuing operations 
the increases in accounts receivable reflect a buildup of unbilled accounts receivable for both of the operating divisions 
this trend in accounts receivable should continue as microdyne s outsourcing technical support and telemetry systems integration revenue continue to increase 
the increase in accounts payable reflect microdyne s increased level of business in its operating divisions 
the increase in the deferred tax asset relates to microdyne s consolidated losses in and cash used in investing activities was million  which primarily relates to additional equipment for the outsourcing support services division s tts facility in california
