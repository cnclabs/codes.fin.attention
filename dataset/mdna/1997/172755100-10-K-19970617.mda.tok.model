overview during fiscal  the company implemented a strategy of focusing on the markets for multimedia graphics  video  and audio  mass storage  and communications 
as part of this strategy  the company has been divesting non core business units and eliminating projects that do not fit within its core markets 
at the same time  the company implemented a program to manage costs and streamline operations 
these efforts culminated in the fourth quarter of fiscal with a reorganization into four market focused product divisions personal computer products  communications products  mass storage products  and crystal semiconductor products  and a decision to outsource its production testing and to consolidate certain corporate functions 
in connection with these actions  the company effected a workforce reduction of approximately people in april  representing approximately percent of its worldwide staff 
although the company expects to realize the immediate benefit of a reduced cost structure and anticipates other benefits from the reorganization into market focused divisions  there is no assurance that the company will regain the levels of profitably that it has achieved in the past or that losses will not occur in the future 
the results of operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal were materially impacted by charges relating to the reorganization  the planned outsourcing of production testing  the consolidation of certain corporate functions  and other related factors 
the results of operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal include a restructuring charge of million  the majority of which is attributable to the workforce reduction  the write off of excess assets  and accruals for excess facilities 
in addition  the results of operations also include charges totaling approximately million which are included in cost of sales  and are related to anticipated under utilization of wafer fabrication capacity and some inventory write downs 
net sales net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of from the  million for fiscal during fiscal  the company divested non core business units and eliminated products that did not fit its core markets 
net sales from the core businesses in fiscal were approximately million compared to million in fiscal net sales for fiscal increased over the million for fiscal sales of graphics  audio  and mass storage products decreased in fiscal over fiscal sales of fax modem products increased in fiscal over fiscal the decline in net sales of graphics and audio products in fiscal was the result of decreasing unit sales and declining average selling prices 
the decline in net sales of mass storage products was the result of reduced sales of controller products offset somewhat by an increase in sales of read channel products 
the increase in net sales of fax modem products was primarily the result of increased sales of newer high speed modem products  particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal over the fourth quarter of fiscal the net sales increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of growth in sales during the first three quarters of fiscal offset somewhat by a decline during the fourth quarter of fiscal sales of mass storage and wireless communication products increased in each of the first three quarters of fiscal but declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal against the third quarter of fiscal net sales of graphics and audio products for the first three quarters of fiscal increased over the comparable period of fiscal  but declined in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal against the second quarter of fiscal net sales of graphics and wireless communication products declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal over the fourth quarter of fiscal export sales  principally to asia  include sales to overseas operations of domestic corporations and were approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal export sales to the pacific rim were and of net sales  to japan were and of net sales  and to europe and the rest of the world were and of net sales  in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  net sales to compaq computer corporation were approximately of net sales 
in fiscal and  no single customer accounted for or more of net sales 
gross margin the gross margin percentage was in fiscal  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the gross margin in fiscal was adversely impacted by million of charges that were recorded in the fourth quarter related to anticipated under use of wafer fabrication capacity of million and inventory write downs of million 
the gross margin in fiscal was adversely impacted by million of fourth quarter charges related to inventory write downs  under use of capacity  and manufacturing variances 
exclusive of these charges  the gross margin percentage was and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
while these gross margins were relatively flat  they reflect reduced unit costs resulting from the migration to larger wafers and more efficient processing technologies  improved efficiencies at the company s micrus facility  and a decrease in the cost of wafers and assembly services purchased from third party suppliers  all of which were offset by the impact of decreased average selling prices for most of the company s major products 
during fiscal  the gross margin percentage declined from in the first quarter to a low of in the fourth fiscal quarter 
the gross margin percentage decreased as a result of charges for inventory written down for lower than anticipated shipments of and demand for graphics  audio  core logic and other products and charges for underutilization of capacity at the micrus joint venture 
the decline in the gross margin percentage was also the result of higher wafer costs caused by an increase in wafer prices for merchant wafers  an insufficient supply of micron wafers  which made necessary the use of less cost effective micron wafers to meet expanded unit shipments  expediting expenses related to premiums paid to suppliers to increase production of the company s products  lower yields on new products ramping into production  and lower selling prices on certain graphics  audio  and fax modem products 
during fiscal  the gross margin percentage declined from a high of in the first fiscal quarter to a low of in the fourth fiscal quarter 
research and development expenses research and development expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales were   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
during the last two quarters of fiscal  the absolute amount of expense decreased compared to the comparable quarters in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of reduced spending in areas other than those considered part of the company s core business opportunities including the impact of divestitures during the year 
the company expects the absolute amount of research and development expense will decrease in fiscal primarily as a result of the company s business divestitures and its fourth quarter decision to undertake a reorganization  consolidation efforts  and a reduction in workforce 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales represented approximately   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
the dollar amount of such expenses in fiscal decreased primarily as a result of reductions in compensation expenses  marketing expenses for promotions and advertising  and administrative expenses  including the impact of divestitures 
the absolute spending increase in fiscal over fiscal reflected increased direct expenses for the expanded sales force  increased marketing expenses for promotions and advertising  and increased administrative and legal expenses 
the company expects the absolute amount of selling  general and administrative expense to decrease in fiscal primarily as a result of the company s business divestitures and its fourth quarter decision to undertake a reorganization  consolidation efforts  and a reduction in workforce 
gain on sale of assets during the second quarter of fiscal  the company completed the sale of the picopower product line to national semiconductor  inc the company received approximately million in cash for the picopower product line 
in connection with the transaction  the company recorded a gain of approximately million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company completed the sale to adc telecommunications inc of the pcsi product group that produced cdpd cellular digital packet data base station equipment for wireless service providers  and developed pact personal air communications technology base stations for at t wireless services inc the company received approximately million in cash for the group 
in connection with the transaction  the company recorded a gain of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed the sale of the assets of pcsi s wireless semiconductor products to rockwell international for million in cash and made the decision to shut down pcsi s subscriber product group 
pcsi s wireless semiconductor product group provided digital cordless chip solutions for phs personal handyphone system and dect digital european cordless telecommunications as well two way messaging chip solutions for pact personal air communications technology 
in connection with the sale of the wireless semiconductor product group and the shut down of the subscriber group  the company recorded a net gain of million in the fourth quarter 
restructuring costs restructuring charges in fiscal of million included million related to workforce reductions and million primarily related to excess assets and facilities 
the implementation of this plan commenced during the fourth quarter of fiscal and will require a total cash outlay of approximately million  the majority of which is expected to be paid in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of decreased demand for the company s products for use in personal computers  which accounts for more than of the company s revenue  management reviewed the various operating areas of the business and took certain steps to bring operating expenses and capacity in line with demand 
these actions resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million 
the principal actions in the restructuring involved the consolidation of support infrastructure and the withdrawal from an unprofitable product line and reduction of planned production capacity 
this resulted in the elimination of approximately positions from the manufacturing  research and development  sales and marketing  and administrative departments 
the major components of the restructuring charges were million related to workforce reductions and million of capacity scaleback and other costs 
the implementation of this plan commenced during the fourth quarter of fiscal approximately million of cash outlays occurred in fiscal the balance of approximately million  related primarily to facilities lease payments  will occur in fiscal non recurring and merger costs in the third quarter of fiscal  non recurring costs were approximately million associated with the formation of the cirent semiconductor joint venture with lucent technologies formerly at t microelectronics 
in the second quarter of fiscal  non recurring and merger costs were approximately million 
non recurring costs of million were primarily associated with the acquisition of technology and marketing rights and the remaining minority interest in a subsidiary  and the formation of the micrus joint venture with ibm 
merger costs of approximately million for the august combination of cirrus logic and picopower included one time costs for charges related to the combination of the two companies  financial advisory services  and legal and accounting fees 
interest expense interest expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of the issuance of convertible subordinated notes in the third quarter of fiscal and increased borrowings on short term and long term debt during fiscal and fiscal interest income and other  net interest income and other  net in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest income increased in fiscal over fiscal as a result of an increase in the amount of short term investments 
the decrease in fiscal over fiscal was primarily the result of a decrease in the amount of short term investments 
foreign currency transaction gains sales of the company s products are denominated primarily in us dollars 
accordingly  any increase in the value of the us dollar as compared to currencies in the company s principal overseas markets would increase the local currency cost of the company s products  which may negatively affect sales in those markets 
in addition  certain japanese yen denominated intercompany receivables and yen denominated cash accounts are subject to remeasurement into us dollars 
this remeasurement resulted in a foreign currency gain of approximately million in fiscal subsequent to fiscal  the company has hedged its exposure to the japanese yen denominated assets through the use of foreign currency forward and option contracts 
under this strategy  gains or losses on hedging transactions are offset by gains or losses on the underlying foreign currency assets or liabilities being hedged 
transaction gains and losses were not material in fiscal and the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
income taxes the benefit for income taxes was in fiscal compared to a benefit for income taxes of in fiscal and a provision for income taxes of in fiscal the fiscal and rates are different from the fiscal rate and from the us statutory rate primarily because of foreign operating results which are taxed at rates other than the us statutory rate 
the fiscal effective tax rate is less than the us statutory rate primarily because of the research and development tax credit and certain foreign earnings taxed at lower rates 
liquidity and capital resources during the third quarter of fiscal  a million lease package was completed  with cirrus logic as guarantor  to finance the advanced fab equipment for the cirent semiconductor manufacturing joint venture 
during the same quarter  the company completed an offering of million of convertible subordinated notes 
the notes bear interest at six percent  mature in december  and are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at per share 
during fiscal  the company generated million of cash and cash equivalents from its operating activities as compared to million during fiscal and million in fiscal the fiscal decrease from fiscal was primarily caused by the increase in the net loss from operations  offset somewhat by the non cash effect of depreciation and amortization and the net change in operating assets and liabilities 
the fiscal decrease from fiscal was primarily caused by the loss from operations and the net change in operating assets and liabilities offset somewhat by the non cash effect of depreciation and amortization 
the company used million in cash in investing activities during fiscal  million during fiscal and million during fiscal the company had a decrease in proceeds from short term investments and increased short term investment purchases in fiscal over fiscal the cash used in fiscal was reduced somewhat by a decrease in additions to property and equipment and the proceeds from sale of assets 
the decrease in investing activities during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily the result of liquidating investments during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  proceeds from the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes provided the largest increase in resources offset by repayment of short term bank debt 
during fiscal  increased borrowings on short term and long term debt and to a lesser extent  issuance of common stock under stock plans provided the largest increase over fiscal the semiconductor industry is extremely capital intensive 
to remain competitive  the company believes it must continue to invest in advanced wafer manufacturing and in test equipment 
investments will continue to be made in the various external manufacturing arrangements and its own facilities 
the company intends to obtain most of the necessary capital through direct or guaranteed equipment lease financing and the balance through debt and or equity financing  and cash generated from operations 
as of march   the company is contingently liable as guarantor or co guarantor for micrus and cirent equipment leases which have remaining payments of approximately million due through in addition  the company has other commitments related to its joint venture relationships that total approximately million at march  there can be no assurance that financing will be available or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
failure to obtain adequate financing would restrict the company s ability to expand its manufacturing infrastructure  to make other investments in capital equipment  and to pursue other initiatives 
as of march   the company has a commitment for a bank line of credit for borrowings up to a maximum of million  expiring on october   at the banks prime rate plus one half percent 
as of march   no borrowings were outstanding under the line 
borrowings are secured by cash  accounts receivable  inventory  intellectual property  and stock in the company s subsidiaries 
use of the line is limited to the borrowing base as defined by accounts receivable 
terms of the agreement include satisfaction of certain financial ratios  minimum tangible net worth  cash flow  and leverage requirements as well as a prohibition against the payment of a cash dividend without prior bank approval 
the company was not in compliance with certain financial ratios and the profitability covenant as of march  the company expects to amend or replace the existing line of credit facility in fiscal management continues to evaluate other possibilities for additional financing 
there is no assurance that financing will be available or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
future operating results quarterly fluctuations the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
the company s operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors  many of which are outside of the company s control  including but not limited to  economic conditions and overall market demand in the united states and worldwide  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  changes in product mix  fluctuations in manufacturing costs which affect the company s gross margins  declines in market demand for the company s and its customers products  sales timing  the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by the company s products  product obsolescence  price erosion  and competitive factors 
the company s operating results in are likely to be affected by these factors as well as others 
the company must order wafers and build inventory well in advance of product shipments 
because the company s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes  there is a risk that the company will forecast inaccurately and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
this inventory risk is heightened because many of the company s customers place orders with short lead times 
such inventory imbalances have occurred in the past and in fact contributed significantly to the company s operating losses in fiscal and these factors increase not only the inventory risk but also the difficulty of forecasting quarterly operating results 
moreover  as is common in the semiconductor industry  the company frequently ships more product in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  and shipments in the third month are higher at the end of that month 
the concentration of sales in the last month of the quarter contributes to difficulty in predicting the company s quarterly revenues and results of operations 
the company s success is highly dependent upon its ability to develop complex new products  to introduce them to the marketplace ahead of the competition  and to have them selected for design into products of leading system manufacturers 
both revenues and margins may be affected quickly if new product introductions are delayed or if the company s products are not designed into successive generations of products of the company s customers 
these factors have become increasingly important to the company s results of operations because the rate of change in the markets served by the company continues to accelerate 
issues relating to manufacturing and manufacturing investment during fiscal  manufacturing capacity exceeded demand for certain of the company s products and the company believes that its manufacturing capacity will exceed demand at least through the second quarter of fiscal as a consequence  the company incurred charges related to its micrus joint venture for failing to purchase sufficient wafers and recorded a fourth quarter accrual for anticipated under use of wafer fabrication capacity  negatively impacting gross margins 
although the company believes that its efforts to increase its source of wafer supply through joint ventures micrus with ibm and cirent semiconductor with lucent technologies and other arrangements have significant potential benefits to the company  there are also risks  some of which materialized in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal and the second and fourth quarters of fiscal these arrangements reduce the company s flexibility to reduce the amount of wafers it is committed to purchase and increase the company s fixed manufacturing costs as a percentage of overall costs of sales 
as a result  the operating results of the company are becoming more sensitive to fluctuations in revenues 
in the case of the company s joint ventures  under use of wafer fabrication capacity is charged to the company in proportion to its capacity commitments  which adversely affects gross margins and earnings 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company accrued million for anticipated under use of wafer fabrication capacity 
in the case of the company s take or pay contracts with foundries  the company must pay contractual penalties if it fails to purchase its minimum commitments 
moreover  the company will benefit from the micrus and cirent semiconductor joint ventures only if they are able to produce wafers at or below prices generally prevalent in the market 
if  however  either of these ventures is not able to produce wafers at competitive prices  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the process of beginning production and increasing volume with the joint ventures inevitably involves risks  and there can be no assurance that the manufacturing costs of such ventures will be competitive 
during fiscal  excess production capacity in the industry lead to significant price competition between foundries and the company believes that in some cases this resulted in pricing from certain foundries that was lower than the company s cost of production from its manufacturing joint ventures 
the company experienced pressures on its selling prices during fiscal  which had a negative impact on its results of operations and it believes that this was partially due to the fact that certain of its competitors were able to obtain favorable pricing from these foundries 
certain provisions of the micrus and cirent semiconductor agreements may cause the termination of the joint venture in the event of a change in control of the company 
such provisions could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change of control of the company 
in connection with the financing of its operations  the company has borrowed money and entered into substantial equipment lease obligations and is likely to expand such commitments in the future 
such indebtedness could cause the company s principal and interest obligations to increase substantially 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  acquisitions  or other purposes and could make it more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
the company s ability to meet its debt service and other obligations will be dependent upon the company s future performance  which will be subject to financial  business  and other factors affecting the operations of the company  many of which are beyond its control 
an inability to obtain financing to meet these obligations could cause the company to become in default of such obligations 
although the company has increased its future wafer supplies from the micrus and cirent semiconductor joint ventures  the company expects to continue to purchase portions of its wafers from  and to be reliant upon  outside merchant wafer suppliers for at least the next two years 
the company also uses other outside vendors to package the wafer die into integrated circuits and will begin using outside vendors for certain production testing beginning in fiscal the company s results of operations could be adversely affected in the future  and has been in the past  if particular suppliers are unable to provide a sufficient and timely supply of product  whether because of raw material shortages  capacity constraints  unexpected disruptions at the plants  delays in qualifying new suppliers or other reasons  or if the company is forced to purchase wafers or packaging from higher cost suppliers or to pay expediting charges to obtain additional supply  or if the company s test facilities are disrupted for an extended period of time 
because of the concentration of sales at the end of each quarter  a disruption in the company s production or shipping near the end of a quarter could materially reduce the company s revenues for that quarter 
production may be constrained even though capacity is available at one or more wafer manufacturing facilities because of the difficulty of moving production from one facility to another 
any supply shortage could adversely affect sales and operating profits 
as the company s products increase in complexity and integrate an increasing number of functions on one semiconductor device  there is also an increased risk that latent defects or subtle faults could be discovered by customers or end users after volumes of product have been shipped 
if such defects were significant  the company could incur material recall and replacement costs for product warranty 
dependence on pc market sales of most of the company s products depend largely on sales of personal computers pcs 
reduced growth in the pc market could affect the financial health of the company as well as its customers 
moreover  as a component supplier to pc oems and to peripheral device manufacturers  the company is likely to experience a greater magnitude of fluctuations in demand than the company s customers themselves experience 
in addition  many of the company s products are used in pcs for the consumer market  and the consumer pc market is more volatile than other segments of the pc market 
other integrated circuit ic makers  including intel corporation  have expressed their interest in integrating through hardware functions  adding through special software functions  or kitting components to provide some multimedia or communications features into or with their microprocessor products 
successful integration of these functions could substantially reduce the company s opportunities for ic sales in these areas 
a number of pc oems buy products directly from the company and also buy motherboards  add in boards or modules from suppliers who in turn buy products from the company 
accordingly  a significant portion of the company s sales may depend directly or indirectly on the sales to a particular pc oem 
since the company cannot track sales by motherboard  add in board or module manufacturers  the company may not be fully informed as to the extent or even the fact of its indirect dependence on any particular pc oem  and  therefore  may be unable to assess the risk of such indirect dependence 
the pc market is intensely price competitive 
the pc manufacturers  in turn  put pressure on the price of all pc components  and this pricing pressure is expected to continue 
issues relating to graphics products the pc graphics market today consists primarily of two dimensional d graphics accelerators and d graphics accelerators with video features 
market demand for three dimensional d graphics acceleration began to grow in the third quarter of fiscal and is expected to grow stronger in fiscal  primarily in pc products for the consumer marketplace 
several of the company s competitors design  produce and market d accelerators 
the company continues to experience intense competition in the sale of both d and d graphics products 
several competitors introduced products and adopted pricing strategies that have increased competition in the desktop graphics market  and new competitors continue to enter the market 
these competitive factors affected the company s market share  gross margins  and earnings in fiscal and are likely to affect revenues and gross margins for graphics accelerator products in the future 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company introduced and began shipping its first rambus dram based d accelerator for the mainstream pc market 
sales of the company s d accelerator products were not material in fiscal the company is striving to bring additional products with d acceleration to market  but there is no assurance that it will succeed in doing so in a timely manner 
if these additional products are not brought to market in a timely manner or do not address the market needs or cost or performance requirements  then the company s graphics market share and sales could be adversely affected 
revenues from the sale of graphics products in fiscal are also likely to be significantly dependent on the success of the company s current dram based d graphics video accelerators 
issues relating to audio products most of the company s revenues in the multimedia audio market derive from the sales of bit audio codecs and integrated bit codec plus controller solutions for the consumer pc market 
pricing pressures have forced a transition from multi chip solutions to products that integrate the codec  controller  and synthesis functions into a single ic 
the company s revenues from the sale of audio products in fiscal are likely to be significantly affected by the success of its recently introduced fully integrated  single chip audio ics 
moreover  aggressive competitive pricing pressures have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the company s revenues and gross margins from the sale of single chip audio ics 
in addition  the introduction of new audio products from the company s competitors  the introduction of mediaprocessors and the introduction of mmx processors with multimedia features by intel corporation could adversely affect revenues and gross margins from the sale of the company s audio products 
three dimensional  spatial effects audio is expected to become an important feature in fiscal  primarily in products for the consumer marketplace 
the company has begun shipping such products 
if the company s spatial effects audio products do not meet the cost or performance requirements of the market  revenues from the sale of audio products could be adversely affected 
issues relating to mass storage market the disk drive market has historically been characterized by a relatively small number of disk drive manufacturers and by periods of rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and contraction 
growth in the mass storage market is directly affected by growth in the pc market 
furthermore  the price competitive nature of the disk drive industry continues to put pressure on the price of all disk drive components 
in addition  consolidation in the disk drive industry has reduced the number of customers for the company s mass storage products and increased the risk of large fluctuations in demand 
the company believes that constraints in supply of certain read head components to the disk drive industry limited sales of its mass storage products in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the company believes that excess inventories held by its customers limited sales of the company s mass storage products in the second quarter of fiscal and limited sales of the company s optical disk drive products in the third quarter of fiscal revenues from mass storage products in fiscal are likely to depend heavily on the success of certain inch disk drive products selected for use by various customers  which in turn depends upon obtaining timely customer qualification of the new products and bringing the products into volume production timely and cost effectively 
the company s revenues from mass storage products are dependent on the successful introduction by its customers of new disk drive products 
recent efforts by certain of the company s customers to develop their own ics for mass storage products could in the future reduce demand for the company s mass storage products  which could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and gross margins from such products 
in addition  in response to the current market trend towards integrating hard disk controllers with microcontrollers  the company s revenues and gross margins from its mass storage products will be dependent on the company s ability to introduce such integrated products in a commercially competitive manner 
issues relating to communications market most of the company s revenues from communications products are expected to derive from sales of voice data fax modem chip sets 
the market for these products is intensely competitive  and competitive pricing pressures have affected and are likely to continue to affect the average selling prices and gross margins from this product line 
the success of the company s products will depend not only on the products themselves but also on the degree and timing of market acceptance of new performance levels developed by us robotics  which will be supported by the company s new products  and the development of standards with regard to these new performance levels 
moreover  as a relatively new entrant to this market  the company may be at a competitive disadvantage to suppliers who have long term customer relationships  have greater market share  or have greater financial resources 
in addition  the introduction of new modem products from the company s competitors  the introduction of mediaprocessors  and the introduction of mmx processors with multimedia features by intel corporation could adversely affect revenues and gross margins from the sale of the company s modem products 
issues related to reorganization during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to reorganize into four market focused divisions personal computer products  communications products  mass storage products  and crystal semiconductor products  outsource its production testing  and consolidate certain corporate functions 
in connection with these actions  the company effected a workforce reduction of approximately people  representing approximately of the worldwide staff 
there is no assurance that these actions will be successful or have a positive impact on results of operations 
furthermore  should such actions have a negative impact on the company s ability to design and develop new products  market new or existing products  or produce and or purchase products at competitive prices  these actions could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
intellectual property matters the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company and certain of its customers from time to time have been notified that they may be infringing certain patents and other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  customers have been named in suits alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights by customer products 
certain components of these products have been purchased from the company and may be subject to indemnification provisions made by the company to its customers 
although licenses are generally offered in situations where the company or its customers are named in suits alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights  there can be no assurance that any licenses or other rights can be obtained on acceptable terms 
because successive generations of the company s products tend to offer an increasing number of functions  there is a likelihood that more of these claims will occur as the products become more highly integrated 
the company cannot accurately predict the eventual outcome of any suit or other alleged infringement of intellectual property 
an unfavorable outcome occurring in any such suit could have an adverse effect on the company s future operations and or liquidity 
foreign operations and markets because many of the company s subcontractors and several of the company s key customers  such customers collectively accounting for a significant percentage of the company s revenues  are located in japan and other asian countries  the company s business is subject to risks associated with many factors beyond its control 
international operations and sales may be subject to political and economic risks  including political instability  currency controls  exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in import export regulations  tariff and freight rates 
although the company buys hedging instruments to reduce its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company s competitive position can be affected by the exchange rate of the us dollar against other currencies  particularly the japanese yen 
competition the company s business is intensely competitive and is characterized by new product cycles  price erosion  and rapid technological change 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  where the customer evaluates alternative design approaches that require integrated circuits 
because of shortened product life cycles and even shorter design in cycles  the company s competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to achieve design wins in next generation systems 
in the event that competitors succeed in supplanting the company s products  the company s market share may not be sustainable and net sales  gross margin  and results of operations would be adversely affected 
competitors include major domestic and international companies  many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
emerging companies are also increasing their participation in the market  as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 
competitors include manufacturers of standard semiconductors  application specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits  including both chip and board level products 
in addition  the integration of additional functions onto individual devices is expected to result in a convergence of existing markets and increase the number of competitors faced by the company 
the ability of the company to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving area of high performance integrated circuit technology depends significantly on factors both within and outside of its control  including  but not limited to  success in designing  manufacturing and marketing new products  wafer supply  protection of company products by effective utilization of intellectual property laws  product quality  reliability  ease of use  price  diversity of product line  efficiency of production  the pace at which customers incorporate the company s integrated circuits into their products  success of the customers products  and general economic conditions 
also the company s future success depends  in part  upon the continued service of its key engineering  marketing  sales  manufacturing  support  and executive personnel  and on its ability to continue to attract  retain  and motivate qualified personnel 
the competition for such employees is intense  and the loss of the services of one or more of these key personnel could adversely affect the company 
because of this and other factors  past results may not be a useful predictor of future results
