the amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced 
the company estimates that its effective income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be approximately in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues increased from million in to million in revenue growth was primarily attributable to increases in minutes of use and the average rate per minute for long distance traffic 
the company s average rate per minute increased from in to in interstate minutes of use increased to million minutes and intrastate minutes of use increased to million minutes

additional sources of cash in included long term borrowings of million  sales of additional common stock to mci of million  and payments on notes receivable of  the company s uses of cash included payment of the cash portion of the consideration for the acquisition of the cable companies 
the total purchase price for the acquisition of the cable companies was million and was financed by the company through the issuance of approximately million shares of gci s class a common stock valued at million  cash  debt assumption of million  and issuance of subordinated notes totaling million 
the subordinated notes were converted in accordance with their terms into approximately million shares of the company s class a common stock in january the company s expenditures for property and equipment  including construction in progress  totaled million and million during and  respectively 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures plan for includes approximately to million in capital necessary to pursue its business plans  to maintain the network and to enhance transmission capacity to meet projected traffic demands 
planned capital expenditures over the next five years include million to million for long distance network expansion  excluding completion of the company s rural dama network  million to million for facilities and equipment necessary to commence providing local exchange services  and million to million for upgrades to the cable systems the company has not yet finalized its construction plans for a pcs network and therefore cannot predict the level or timing of its pcs network expenditures 
sources of funds for these planned capital expenditures will likely include internally generated cash flows  borrowings under the company s credit facilities  and additional debt and equity offerings 
sufficient additional financing has not been arranged as of march  for total planned capital expenditures 
to the extent that the necessary financing is not obtained  certain of the company s capital expenditures will be postponed until such financing is obtained

the amount payable upon expected delivery of the transponders in is dependent upon a number of factors including the number of transponders required and the timing of their delivery and acquisition 
the company does not expect the remaining balance payable on delivery to exceed million 
the company obtained necessary apuc and fcc approvals and commenced construction and deployment of dama technology in sites in rural alaska on a demonstration basis in construction and deployment is expected to be substantially completed in mid  with services expected to be provided at that time 
construction and deployment costs are expected to total to million  of which million had been incurred through december  alaska economy the company offers telecommunication and video services to customers primarily throughout alaska 
as a result of this geographic concentration  the company s growth and operations depend upon economic conditions in alaska 
the economy of alaska is dependent upon the natural resource industries  in particular oil production  as well as tourism  government  and united states military spending 
any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on the company 
oil revenues over the past several years have contributed in excess of of the revenues from all segments of the alaska economy 
the volume of oil transported by the transalaska oil pipeline system over the past years has been as high as million barrels per day in over the past several years  it has begun to decline and is expected to average approximately million barrels per day in the volume of oil transported by that pipeline is expected to decrease to million barrels per day in less than ten years  based upon present developed oil fields using the pipeline for transport 
the two largest producers of oil in alaska independently resolved in to pursue exploration  development and production activities within alaska 
both producers have invested large sums of money in oil recovery technology and development to enhance oil recovery in marginal oil fields 
effective march the state of alaska passed new legislation relaxing state oil royalties on marginal oil fields to facilitate development of such marginal oil fields 
no assurance can be given that oil companies will be successful in discovering new oil fields  further developing existing oil fields  or increasing yields in marginal oil fields 
if the oil companies are not successful  continued decline in oil production is likely in the future 
this decline would adversely affect the state and demand for telecommunications and cable television services 
seasonality long distance revenues have historically been highest in the summer months as a result of temporary population increases attributable to tourism and increased seasonal economic activity such as construction  commercial fishing  and oil and gas activities 
cable television revenues  on the other hand  are higher in the winter months because consumers tend to watch more television  and spend more time at home  during these months 
the company s ability to implement construction projects is also reduced during the winter months because of cold temperatures  snow and short daylight hours 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has a significant effect on its operations 
accounting pronouncement in june  the final accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after december  and is to be applied prospectively 
this statement provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities based on consistent application of a financial components approach that focuses on control 
it distinguishes transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
management of the company does not expect that adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or liquidity
