item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the insurance industry has undergone significant consolidation over the past several years 
consolidation has been driven by the need for  and benefits from  economies of scale and scope in providing low cost insurance packages to customers 
this trend has involved both insurance brokerages  who are the company s primary customers  and insurance companies  and is directly impacting the manner in which insurance products are distributed 
the company s management believes that the insurance industry will continue to experience significant changes in the next two to three years to meet the changing distribution model 
these changes should create opportunities for the company to become a customer focused automation and information management solutions provider 
the company s management believes that this consolidation will force brokerages to decrease their distribution costs via automation and or elimination of labor intensive tasks such as the reduction of paper processing and the elimination of non value added distribution points via on line distribution 
they also will need to increase service levels with quicker and improved automated processes such as quoting and claims processing 
the company s management believes that it can partner with these participants to provide these automation services

one  and cd
