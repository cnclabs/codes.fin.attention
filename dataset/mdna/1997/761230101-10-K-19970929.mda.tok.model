the following are registered trademarks of the company as used in this document  respironics  remstar  great performers  avia  virtuoso  duet  encore  quartet  maestro  bipap  harmony  pav  plv  gel  monarch  seal easy  circle seal and bageasy 
the following are trademarks of the company as used in this document  solo and vision 
products at the present time  the company s principal products can be divided into three categories obstructive sleep apnea products  ventilation products  and face mask and other products 
obstructive sleep apnea products respironics believes it is the us market share leader in osa therapy devices  with close to a market share 
the company s primary osa products are the great performers family  remstar choice  the bipap s airway management system  and related accessories such as masks  tubes  filters and headgear 
the company introduced its sixth generation family of osa products  known as the great performers product line  during fiscal years and this new family of products includes cpap  bi level and clinical devices 
each of the company s cpap devices consist of a small  portable air pressurization device  an air pressure control  and a mask worn by the patient at home during sleep 
the aria cpap system features built in memory to record patient usage data 
the software necessary to extract this data from the aria unit is known as encore 
the solo cpap system is an innovative osa therapy device that meets the company s strategy of offering units at all key price points 
the great performers family of products also includes another cpap device  known as virtuoso  that utilizes innovative technology to monitor the patient s airway and adjust output automatically in order to deliver the appropriate pressure 
the bipap duet airway management system is the bi level unit in the great performers family 
the duet unit senses the patient s breathing cycle and adjusts the pressure accordingly and also contains advanced leak sensing technology which improves the unit s pressure adjustment capability 
bi level units are used to treat severe osa and are useful in improving acceptance of therapy by patients who have difficulty tolerating cpap 
the great performers clinical system  consisting of the quartet clinical system  a bedside pressure generator  and the maestro clinical remote control unit  is used by clinicians in prescribing therapy for the treatment of adult osa 
the company has received clearance from the united states food and drug administration fda for all of the great performers products 
the company also continues to manufacture and market its remstar choice cpap unit  which was introduced in  and its bipap s airway management system  which was introduced in respironics also manufactures devices related to the diagnosis and monitoring of sleep and other respiratory related disorders  which it obtained through the acquisition of vitalog monitoring inc vitalog in such diagnostic products expand the company s presence in sleep labs which helps drive the market for the company s therapeutic devices 
the company estimates that in the us approximately  sleep clinics currently exist at hospitals and other medical centers where pulmonologists  technicians and other medical professionals diagnose osa as well as other sleep disorders and then prescribe the appropriate treatment 
such laboratories provide the most frequent source of patient introductions to the great performers and remstar choice products 
the osa patient can purchase the great performers products  the remstar choice  or the bipap airway management system from home health care products dealer locations worldwide 
personnel at each of these locations are equipped to train the patient in the product s use and to maintain and service the product see sales  distribution  and marketing 
the retail price for a cpap unit ranges from to  depending on type of unit  geographical market and whether certain accessories are purchased 
the retail price for a bipap s or duet unit generally ranges from  to  depending on which model is purchased 
sales of osa products and all related accessories and replacement parts accounted for   and of the company s net sales for its fiscal years   and  respectively 
ventilation products the company believes it is the leading manufacturer and marketer of non invasive ventilatory support devices in the us such devices are intended to augment the ventilation of a spontaneously breathing patient  but are not intended to satisfy the total ventilatory requirements of the patient 
the company s principal non invasive ventilatory support product is the bipap ventilatory support system  the initial version of which was introduced in december the bipap ventilatory support system is a low pressure  electrically driven flow generator with an electronic pressure control designed to augment patient breathing by supplying pressurized air to the patient 
the bipap ventilatory support system was the first device for non invasive use designed specifically to compensate for mask leaks 
bipap devices sense the patient s breathing and adjust their output to assist in inhalation and exhalation 
the bipap ventilatory support system compensates for mask leaks  which often occur in the delivery of ventilatory support to the patient  thereby providing what the company believes is a more efficient and consistent non invasive therapy than competing volume ventilators 
the company believes the bipap ventilatory support system has the potential for increasing patient comfort by adapting to the patient s breathing cycles as opposed to requiring the patient to adapt his breathing to the ventilator cycles and by delivering therapy effectively with a patient mask rather than requiring intubation 
the retail price for a bipap unit  which ranges from  to  also compares favorably to the cost of invasive ventilators  which generally retail for  to  in may  the company introduced the hospital bipap ventilatory support system  which includes accessories such as an airway pressure monitor  a detachable control panel  a disposable circuit and a mounting stand  all of which are designed to allow the bipap ventilatory support system to be used more easily in the hospital environment 
the company is supporting clinical trials that are investigating the possible benefits of bipap therapy for different types of patient populations 
applications being studied include use by patients suffering from a variety of respiratory disorders  as well as other in hospital applications 
the marketing of bipap ventilatory support systems for use in these patient populations may require additional clearances from the fda prior to marketing in the us during fiscal year  the company began international distribution of its next generation non invasive unit for the hospital market  the bipap vision  with domestic distribution to begin upon receipt of clearance to market from the fda 
the bipap vision features an integrated display screen and an optional oxygen module  provides higher flow and pressure functions and is designed to be easily upgradeable when advanced technology becomes available 
international distribution of bipap harmony  the next generation non invasive unit for the homecare market  is expected to begin before the end of calendar year  with domestic release to follow upon receipt of clearance to market from the fda 
the bipap harmony features simple  menu driven operations and improved portability including ac or dc power capability and is also designed to be easily upgradeable 
the company also is currently conducting research on the incorporation of proportional assist ventilation pav into its line of bipap ventilatory support products 
pav is a mode of ventilatory support that provides assistance in proportion to the needs of the patient 
the company has been granted investigational device exemptions by the fda to conduct clinical tests in the us using pav in both non invasive and invasive applications 
application for regulatory clearance to market devices that include pav  which is required prior to the marketing of such products in the us  has not yet been made 
the pav technology was obtained by the company through a non exclusive licensing arrangement with the university of manitoba in winnipeg  canada 
the company believes that it is also a leading manufacturer and marketer of invasive portable volume ventilators that are used in the home by individuals who are dependent on the ventilators for continuous life support 
these devices had been manufactured and marketed by lifecare  which was acquired by the company in october the company s principal invasive portable volume ventilator is the plv  a microprocessor controlled  electrically powered unit specifically designed for long term use in the home and also suitable for transport  short term  and institutional use 
the plv can be used to ventilate a wide range of patients  including pediatric patients  most often through the use of an endotracheal tube or a tracheostomy tube 
the small  lightweight unit delivers volume ventilation through the operation of a piston inside the unit  and it can be powered by normal ac power or dc battery power 
the plv can be operated in three different ventilation modes depending on the patient s needs  and  because patients using the plv are dependent on the ventilator for life support  the unit features a variety of alarms and displays to alert clinicians and caregivers to changes in the patient s pulmonary status or to possible unit malfunction 
the company manufactures and distributes different versions of the plv for international markets based on language differences  and it also manufactures and distributes a variety of accessories for use with the plv the plv unit and related accessories reach end user patients through the company s network of medical product dealers who purchase or rent the unit from the company and resell or rent it to end users 
prior to the acquisition of lifecare by the company  lifecare had established rental arrangements directly with certain patients 
these existing rental arrangements have been continued 
the company also manufactures  distributes and rents several other home ventilation products  including a version of the plv designed more specifically for institutional use 
sales and rental revenue from all ventilation products and accessories accounted for   and of the company s net sales for fiscal years   and respectively 
face mask and other products the company provides three types of patient masks masks used with cpap and bipap devices including nasal sealing flap masks  the monarch mini mask  the gel and gold seal masks  and full face masks disposable air filled cushion anesthesia masks primarily for use during surgery  and disposable sealeasy and circle seal resuscitation masks for use in medical emergencies 
the company s patient masks are designed to respond to the increasing demand for single use products  which reduce the potential for cross contamination among patients and also help to minimize the exposure of medical personnel to infectious diseases  such as tuberculosis and pneumonia 
the company believes that its nasal sealing flap mask was the first mask to adequately seal on a patient s face for air delivery  thereby minimizing patient discomfort and promoting increased patient compliance with prescribed usage 
the monarch mini mask is designed to enhance patient comfort with its small size and unique placement on the patient s face  the gel and gold seal masks utilize a gel like cushion to create a comfortable mask seal around the contours of the face 
full face masks address the needs of specific patient groups for whom cpap and bipap therapy is delivered most effectively and comfortably through masks that cover the mouth and nose 
the company s line of disposable air filled cushion anesthesia masks utilizes a very thin and pliable soft plastic air filled cushion around the nose and mouth  which provides a uniform seal to prevent leakage of the anesthetic gases and helps ensure compliance with anesthesia gas exposure standards imposed on hospitals by regulatory bodies 
the company s other products include the bageasy manual resuscitator and the rinoflow nasal irrigation product 
sales of all face masks including some masks which are components of osa products and non invasive ventilatory support products and which are also included in the net sales figures for those product groups and other products accounted for   and of the company s net sales for its fiscal years   and  respectively

the company conducts the remainder of its patient mask manufacturing and certain other high volume production of plastic components in a facility in shenzhen city in the peoples republic of china  bordering hong kong and in subic bay  phillipines 
the shenzhen facility is leased and operated by the company 
the present manufacturing space totals approximately  square feet 
the facility is located in a special economic zone where the company has been operating since that was established by the peoples republic of china in to induce foreign investment 
the subic bay facility  totalling approximately  square feet  is also leased 
the company s european facilities all of which are leased include a  square foot manufacturing and warehouse facility in herrsching  germany  a  square foot office and warehouse facility in wendelstein  germany  and  square feet of office and warehouse facilities in nantes  france 
the herrsching facility was the european headquarters of lifecare  and the wendelstein facility was the headquarters of stimotron 
see business general and note k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these acquisitions 
the company also maintains smaller leased facilities  each totaling less than  square feet in size  in wilmington  delaware  redwood city  california  and winnipeg  manitoba 
operations in the far east and europe are subject to the risks normally associated with foreign operations including  but not limited to  foreign currency fluctuations  possible changes in export or import restrictions and the modification or introduction of other governmental policies with potentially adverse effects 
the july change of control in hong kong from british to chinese rule has not affected the company s operations 
the company believes that its present facilities are suitable and adequate for its current and presently anticipated future needs 
while several facilities are extensively utilized  additional productive capacity is available through a variety of means including  at the murrysville and westminster sites  augmenting the current partial second shift work schedule 
rental space  which the company believes is readily available and reasonably priced near each current location  could be utilized as well 
the company also owns approximately acres of land adjacent to the acre site on which the murrysville facility is located 
future expansion in murrysville  if needed  could take place on this acre site 
the company generally performs all major assembly work on all of its products 
it manufactures the plastic components for its face mask products and uses subcontractors to supply certain other components 
the company believes that the raw materials for all of its products are readily available from a number of suppliers 
sales  distribution and marketing the company sells and  in some cases  rents its products primarily to home care and hospital dealers 
these parties in turn resell and rent the company s products to end users 
the company s products reach its customers in the united states primarily through the company s field network  which consists of sales management employees  direct sales representatives and sales support specialists  independent manufacturers representatives and over  medical products distributors also referred to as dealers 
the company manages its us dealer network through the direct sales force and independent manufacturers representatives 
the company s us sales management team includes a senior vice president of sales and marketing  a director of sales  and eight regional sales managers 
this team directs the activities of independent manufacturers representatives and direct sales representatives and sales support specialists 
in most areas of the us  the hospital market is served by the direct sales representatives and the home care market is served primarily by the independent manufacturers representatives 
the company s international sales efforts are conducted through a european general manager  a south american sales manager  a far east sales manager  and a canadian sales manager 
the company also has direct sales representatives and a customer satisfaction staff in europe and the far east and direct sales representatives in canada 
all of the company s international sales employees serve both the home care and hospital markets 
international sales accounted for approximately   and of the company s net sales for fiscal year  and  respectively 
the company s marketing organization is currently staffed with a vice president of marketing and marketing oriented product managers  who are assigned to each of the company s principal product groups 
the product managers stay abreast of changes in the marketplace  with an emphasis on product use specifications  features  price  promotions  education  training and distribution 
the company s dealer customer base which ranges in size from large  publicly held dealers with several hundred branch locations to small  owner operated dealers with one location is undergoing significant consolidation  particularly among dealers specializing in home care products 
the impact on the company of this customer consolidation is likely to continue to be reduced selling prices for the company s products as a result of greater purchasing power and market dominance enjoyed by larger customers 
in october  the company announced that its status with apria healthcare had changed from primary supplier to sole secondary supplier effective in november this change adversely impacted sales levels for the fiscal year ended june  sales to apria during the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  subsequent to the company s change in status  it focused on demonstrating to apria superior effort and added value service surrounding its product offerings 
in spite of these efforts  sales to apria of cpap and bi level units and related masks during the second half of the fiscal year decreased to approximately of levels anticipated prior to the change in status 
while the company cannot predict with certainty what actions apria will take relative to future supplier selection especially in light of apria s announced intentions to review restructuring alternatives  including a possible merger or sale  it is anticipated that an open bidding process will occur again 
the company plans to participate in this bidding process with the goal of maximizing its share of apria s business  but there can be no assurance as to the outcome of such a bidding process 
competition the company believes that the principal competitive factors in all of its markets are product and service performance and innovation 
efficient distribution and competitive price are also very important factors 
in the case of a number of the company s and its competitors products  patent protection is becoming more prevalent and of increasing competitive importance 
the company competes on a product by product basis with various other companies  some of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources and broader product lines 
the company believes that it has the leading position in the us market for home care devices for the treatment of osa 
however  other manufacturers  including other larger and more experienced manufacturers of home health care products  have entered the market and the company expects that competition will increase 
in its major market segments  the company competes with three principal competitors  nellcor puritan bennett nellcor  healthdyne technologies healthdyne and resmed through its subsidiary rescare rescare 
nellcor  which is the company s largest major competitor and has the largest financial resources of the company s competitors  offers an array of products which compete with all of the company s products 
healthdyne is the primary competitor for the company s cpap units and competes with the company in the non invasive ventilatory support market as well 
resmed competes with the company in the osa market  and is in the process of introducing devices that will compete with the company s non invasive ventilatory support products 
similar to the company s customer base  the medical device manufacturing industry is also undergoing significant consolidation 
several of the company s competitors have announced or completed mergers  most notably the august merger of nellcor and puritan bennett group and the subsequent planned acquisition of nellcor puritan bennett by mallinckrodt group  inc that was announced on july  the impact on the company of this competitor consolidation is likely to be greater competition from medical device manufacturers which can utilize the financial and technical resources that may be made available as a result of the consolidation 
research and development the company believes that its ability to identify product opportunities  to respond to the needs of cardiopulmonary physicians and their patients in the treatment of respiratory disorders and to incorporate the latest technological innovations into its medical products has been and will continue to be important to its success 
the company s research and development efforts are focused on understanding the problems faced by cardiopulmonary physicians and their patients needs and on maintaining the company s technological leadership in its core product areas 
the company maintains both formal and informal relationships with physician practitioners and researchers including sleep laboratories to supplement these research and development efforts 
the company s research and development efforts enable it to capitalize on opportunities in the respiratory medical product market  through upgrading its current products as well as developing new products 
the company conducts substantially all of its research and development for existing and potential new products in the us 
the company currently employs approximately engineers and technicians in such activities 
the research and development staff performs overall conceptual design work for all products and the design work related to the manufacturing  engineering and tooling for products manufactured by the company 
the company spent approximately  of net sales in fiscal year   of net sales in fiscal year and  of net sales in fiscal year to support product enhancement and new product development 
a variety of new product introductions took place during fiscal years and  including all of the products in the great performers family  the bipap vision hospital ventilatory support system  and several new face mask products 
by the end of fiscal year  the company expects to have introduced the next generation of products in the great performers family and the bipap harmony home ventilatory support system 
in some cases  initial distribution has been  and will be  conducted in international markets until regulatory clearance to market in the us is obtained 
see regulatory matters 
patents  trademarks and licenses the company seeks patent protection for certain of its products through the prosecution and acquisition of patents and exclusive licensing arrangements 
in addition  the company aggressively defends its patents when infringed by other companies 
the company currently has us and foreign patents and has additional us and foreign patent applications pending 
the company owns the proprietary rights to a variety of its products  including patents on the bipap airway management system  the bipap ventilatory support system  and various masks and related accessories 
the company also has registered us and foreign trademarks and has additional us and foreign trademark applications pending 
the company is a party to several legal actions relating to its patents and the patents of its competitors 
see item legal proceedings for more information regarding these actions 
regulatory matters the company s products are subject to regulation by  among other governmental entities  the fda and corresponding foreign agencies 
the fda regulates the introduction  manufacture  advertising  labeling  packaging  marketing and distribution of and recordkeeping for such products 
on june   new fda regulations governing the manufacture of medical devices took effect 
these regulations imposed new requirements on device manufacturers such as design controls 
in manufacturing and marketing its products  the company must comply with fda regulations and is subject to various other fda recordkeeping requirements and to inspections by the fda 
the testing for and preparation of required applications can be expensive  and subsequent fda review can be lengthy and uncertain 
moreover  clearance or approval  if granted  can include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
failure to comply with applicable fda regulations can result in fines  civil penalties  suspensions or revocation of clearances or approvals  recalls or product seizures  operating restrictions or criminal penalties 
delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  clearances or approvals for the company s products for which such clearances or approvals have not yet been obtained would adversely affect the marketing of such products in the us and could adversely affect the results of future operations 
the company must obtain fda or foreign regulatory approval or clearance for marketing the company s new devices prior to their release 
there are two primary means by which the fda permits a medical device to be marketed 
a manufacturer may seek clearance for the device by filing a k premarket notification with the fda 
to obtain such clearance  the k premarket notification must establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a device that has been legally marketed or was marketed before may  the manufacturer may not place the device into commercial distribution in the us until a substantial equivalence determination notice is issued by the fda 
the fda  however  may determine that the proposed device is not substantially equivalent  or require further information  such as additional test data or clinical data  or require the company to modify its product labeling  before it will make a finding of substantial equivalence 
the process of obtaining fda clearance of a k premarket notification  including testing  preparation of the k premarket notification and subsequent fda review  can take a number of years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
if a manufacturer cannot establish to the fda s satisfaction that a new device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device  it will have to seek approval to market the device through the premarket approval application pma process 
this process involves preclinical studies and clinical trials 
the process of completing clinical trials  submitting a pma and obtaining fda approval takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the fda will approve a pma 
the company s export activities and clinical investigations also are subject to the fda s jurisdiction and enforcement 
foreign regulatory approvals vary widely depending on the country 
in january  the company received iso certification from the international organization of standards  a quality standards organization based in geneva  switzerland 
at the same time  the company received authorization  under the european union s medical device directives  to affix the ce mark to the company s products marketed throughout the world 
the primary component of the certification process was an audit of the company s quality system conducted by an independent agency authorized to perform conformity assessments under iso guidelines and the medical device directives 
since receiving its original iso certification  the company has undergone two annual update audits by such independent agencies  neither of which revealed any non conformities 
in december the company received a warning letter from the fda 
a warning letter is a statement issued by the fda that the agency believes significant violations have occurred and that the agency is prepared to take enforcement action if corrective measures are not taken 
as discussed in its annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june   the company believes that the issues raised in the warning letter have been resolved 
third party reimbursement the cost of a significant portion of medical care in the us is funded by government and private insurance programs  such as medicare  medicaid and corporate health insurance programs including health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations 
the company s future results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected by adverse changes made in the reimbursement policies for medical products under these insurance programs 
if such changes were to occur  the ability of the company s customers medical product distributors and dealers to obtain adequate reimbursement for the resale or rental of the company s products could be reduced 
in recent years  limitations imposed on the levels of reimbursement by both government and private insurance programs have become more prevalent 
the company has obtained procedure codes for its home care products from the health care financing administration hcfa 
these procedure codes enhance the ability of medical product distributors and dealers to obtain reimbursement for providing products to patients covered by medicare 
in addition  many private insurance programs also use the hcfa procedure code system 
however  reimbursement levels can be reduced after a procedure code has been established  as was the case in january when the reimbursement level for all nasal cpap systems was reduced 
the amount of reimbursement that a hospital can obtain under the medicare diagnosis related group drg payment system for utilizing the company s products in treating patients is a primary determinant of the revenue that can be realized by medical product distributors and dealers who resell or rent the company s hospital products 
many private insurance programs also utilize the medicare drg system 
the various uses of the company s hospital products to treat patients are provided within the drg system 
the levels of reimbursement under the drg system are also subject to review and change 
employees as of june   the company had  employees  including hourly employees in the us hourly employees in hong kong and the peoples republic of china  and hourly employees in europe 
none of the company s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the company considers its labor relations to be good and has never suffered a work stoppage as a result of a labor conflict

item legal proceedings australian rescare litigation 
rescare limited  an australian corporation rescare and a subsidiary of resmed  inc resmed  filed suit in australia the australian suit against the company s australian distributor in  alleging that the company s cpap products then being sold by such distributor in australia infringed upon an australian patent the australian patent embodying a substantial part of rescare s cpap technology 
after trial  the australian trial court held that the company s products infringed the australian patent which the court also held to be valid 
this decision was appealed  and in may the australian court of appeals reversed the decision of the trial court  declaring the australian patent invalid 
this decision also nullified the trial court s finding that the company s products infringed upon the australian patent 
in october  the supreme court of australia refused to accept an appeal of the decision of the court of appeals 
no further appeals can be made by rescare with respect to the decision of the australian court of appeals 
in june  the company received a court determined amount of approximately  to offset a portion of the expenses it incurred in pursuing the australian suit 
the receipt of this expense reimbursement effectively closes the australian suit 
us rescare litigation 
in january rescare filed an action the california suit against the company in the united states district court for the southern district of california alleging that in the manufacture and sale in the us of nasal masks and cpap systems and components  the company infringes three us patents  two of which are owned by and one of which is licensed to rescare the rescare patents 
one of the three rescare patents was filed in the us shortly after the australian patent was issued and most of its claims are the same as or similar to the australian patent 
the other two patents involved in the california suit deal with mask applications and with a ramp feature of rescare s cpap devices 
in the complaint  rescare seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief  an accounting for damages and an award of three times actual damages because of the company s alleged willful infringement of the rescare patents 
in its answers to rescare s complaint  the company denied  in all material respects  the allegations of the complaint 
the company also filed an action in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania against rescare seeking declaratory judgments that the rescare patents in issue are either invalid or unenforceable or that the company does not infringe the patents 
in june  the court granted the company s motion for summary judgment that it does not infringe rescare s mask patent 
also as part of its response to the rescare complaint  the company filed a motion in the united states district court for the southern district of california seeking to transfer the california suit to the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania and to consolidate the two suits 
the motion was granted and the cases have been consolidated in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
in june rescare filed another action against the company in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania alleging that in the manufacture and sale in the us of cpap systems  the company infringes a fourth us patent that had been recently issued to rescare relating to the ramp technology component used in cpap systems 
in this additional litigation  rescare seeks similar damages as in the pre existing patent suits 
this suit was consolidated  upon the company s motion  with the pre existing patent suits described above and discovery is now proceeding on the consolidated action

item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations net sales for fiscal year were  representing a increase in net sales over the  recorded in fiscal year net sales represented a increase over the  recorded in fiscal year sales for the fiscal year ended june  included approximately  generated by lifecare international  inc since its acquisition by the company on october  lifecare international  inc has since been renamed respironics colorado  inc 
sales for the fiscal year ended june  also included approximately  generated by stimotron medizinische gerate gmbh stimotron which was acquired on february  both acquisitions were treated as purchases for financial accounting purposes  and accordingly the company s results of operations include the results of operations of respironics colorado  inc and stimotron since the acquisition dates 
the remaining increases in net sales for the year ended june  were attributable to increases in total unit and dollar sales for the company s ventilatory support and osa products 
sales of the company s face masks and other patient interface devices used as accessories for its osa and ventilatory support units also increased significantly in both unit and dollar terms 
the company s gross profit was of net sales for fiscal year as compared to of net sales for fiscal year and of net sales for fiscal year the decreases in gross margin percentage over the three year period were primarily caused by reduced average selling prices for certain of the company s products 
these reductions in average selling price  which had been expected  resulted from increasing competition in the company s primary product lines  particularly in osa  relative to the company s large  national customers who received lower prices in exchange for volume purchase commitments 
in addition  manufacturing support costs grew from fiscal year to fiscal year at a rate higher than the overall rate of sales growth 
general and administrative expenses were  of net sales for fiscal year as compared to  of net sales for fiscal year and  of net sales for fiscal year the increase in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was due primarily to the addition of expenses incurred by the company s new subsidiaries  respironics colorado  inc and stimotron  since their acquisitions on october  and february   respectively 
in addition  amortization of the goodwill generated by those acquisitions began on those dates  with the expense being included in general and administrative expenses 
offsetting these increases was a reduction in the provision for year end profit sharing bonuses for fiscal year based on financial results achieved 
the increase in absolute dollars from fiscal to fiscal year was due primarily to an increased provision for year end profit sharing bonuses based on financial results achieved and to increased legal fees  including those incurred related to the previously disclosed rescare patent litigation 
the overall increases in absolute dollars for both comparisons were still at rates less than the rate of increase in overall sales 
sales  marketing and commission expenses were  of net sales for fiscal year as compared to  of net sales for fiscal year and  of net sales for fiscal year the increase from fiscal year to fiscal year was due primarily to the addition of expenses incurred by the company s new subsidiaries  respironics colorado  inc and stimotron 
respironics colorado  inc 
has a network of fully staffed customer satisfaction centers throughout the us  a portion of the costs of which are included in sales  marketing and commissions 
in addition  because stimotron serves as the company s exclusive distributor in germany  most of its operating expenses are included in sales  marketing and commissions 
increased costs were also incurred for the company s sales and marketing efforts elsewhere in europe 
the increase in absolute dollars from fiscal to fiscal was due to higher commissions paid to independent sales representatives based on the increased sales levels achieved  increased trade show and related travel expenses  and increased salary expenses  primarily for new employees in sales and marketing management and training and medical education 
research and development expenses were  of net sales for fiscal year as compared to  of net sales for fiscal year and  of net sales for fiscal year the increase in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year reflects the significant new product development efforts undertaken to support product introductions in the company s major product groups  including the solo cpap unit  the bipap s t d  the bipap duet system along with several mask and patient interface products 
major product development work was also done on several new products for which fda clearance to market in the us is pending 
the increase in absolute dollars from fiscal to fiscal primarily reflects the costs associated with developing a new family of osa therapy devices  the great performers line  that was introduced starting in fiscal year additional costs were also incurred throughout the three year period to fund clinical studies and work involving opportunities in other respiratory product areas 
the company s effective income tax rate was for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year and for fiscal year changes in the company s effective income tax rate are due primarily to changes in the relative proportions of taxable income attributable to its us and european operations versus taxable income attributable to its hong kong and peoples republic of china operations because the us and european operations pay income taxes at a higher rate approximately before available income tax credits than do the hong kong and peoples republic of china operations 
for the fiscal year to comparison  the proportion of taxable income attributable to the us and european operations increased  due in part to taxable income generated by the company s new subsidiaries  respironics colorado  inc and stimotron  since their acquisitions 
in addition  the amortization of the goodwill generated by the acquisitions is not a tax deductible expense  and therefore also contributed to the increased effective income tax rate 
for the fiscal year to comparison  the proportion of taxable income attributable to the us operation also increased  and a research and development tax credit that was available in fiscal year expired in fiscal year  further contributing to the increased income tax rate this tax credit was reinstated for fiscal year 
as a result of the factors described above  the company s net income was  of net sales or per share for fiscal year as compared to  of net sales or per share for fiscal year and  of net sales or per share for fiscal year in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 earnings per share  which is required to be adopted on december  at that time  the company will be required to change the method currently used to compute earnings per share and to restate all prior periods 
under the new requirements for calculating primary earnings per share  the dilutive effect of stock options will be excluded 
the adoption of statement no 
is expected to increase the company s primary earnings per share called basic earnings per share under the statement by less than and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s fully diluted earnings per share called diluted earnings per share under the statement 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of  and  at june  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities from fiscal year to fiscal year was due primarily to higher earnings in fiscal year and to an increase in accounts receivable in fiscal year in an amount smaller than the increase in that account in the prior year 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from fiscal year to fiscal year was due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable during fiscal year in an amount greater than the increase in that account during fiscal year and to a tax refund received during fiscal year the increase in accounts receivable during fiscal year described above was due to growth in international sales at a rate greater than overall sales growth all of the company s international sales are made on extended payment terms  an increase in the portion of the company s domestic sales that were made on extended payment terms  and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the proportion of the company s sales made late in the fiscal year 
net cash used by investing activities was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
net cash used by investing activities for fiscal year included  relating to the october  acquisition of lifecare international  inc and  relating to the february  acquisition of stimotron 
additional consideration of up to  over the next four years may be due for the stimotron acquisition based upon financial results achieved in germany 
net cash used by investing activities for fiscal year included an expenditure of  representing a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of vitalog 
the remainder of the purchase price for the vitalog acquisition was paid with shares of the company s common stock 
see note k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions 
net cash used for capital expenditures  consisting primarily of the purchase of production equipment  computer hardware and software  and office equipment  was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
funding for the lifecare and vitalog acquisitions was provided by accumulated cash and short term investment balances 
funding for the stimotron acquisition was provided by a  loan received from a commercial bank in february under the terms of a credit agreement 
funding for a portion of a  square foot addition to the company s manufacturing facility in murrysville  pennsylvania was provided by a  pennsylvania industrial development authority loan received in february see notes d and k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about long term obligations and acquisition financing 
funding for the other investment activities in fiscal years  and was provided by positive cash flows from operating activities and accumulated cash and short term investment balances 
net cash provided by financing activities includes  from a public offering of  shares of common stock completed in april and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option plans during each of the years presented 
net cash provided by financing activities also reflects  for fiscal year  the company s acquisition of  shares of its common stock for  in the open market pursuant to a stock buy back program announced in november in october  the company entered into a new line of credit facility with a commercial bank that provides for the availability of  at a maximum interest rate equal to the bank s prime interest rate until the expiration date of the agreement on october  the company expects that this line of credit facility will be renewed prior to its expiration 
see note d to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the line of credit 
in october  the company announced that its status with apria healthcare apria had changed from primary supplier to sole secondary supplier effective in november this change adversely affected sales levels for the year ended june  sales to apria during the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  subsequent to the company s change in status  it focused on demonstrating to apria superior effort and added value service surrounding its product offerings 
in spite of these efforts  sales to apria of cpap and bi level units and related masks during the second half of the fiscal year decreased to approximately of levels anticipated prior to the change in status 
while the company cannot predict with certainty what actions apria will take relative to future supplier selection especially in light of apria s announced intentions to review restructuring alternatives  including a possible merger or sale  it is anticipated that an open bidding process will occur again 
the company plans to participate in this bidding process with the goal of maximizing its share of apria s business  but there can be no assurance as to the outcome of such a bidding process 
the company has not provided a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets because it has determined that it is more likely than not that such assets can be realized  at a minimum  through carrybacks to prior years in which taxable income was generated 
the company believes that positive cash flow from operating and financing activities  the availability of the full amount of funds under its commercial bank line of credit  commercial bank financing committed for the additional consideration that may be due for the stimotron acquisition  and its accumulated cash and short term investments will be sufficient to meet its current and presently anticipated future needs for fiscal year for operating activities  investing activities  and financing activities primarily consisting of payments on long term debt 
inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s business during the periods discussed
