item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation cautionary note regarding forward looking statements the following discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
statements indicating that the company expects  estimates or believes are forward looking  as are all other statements concerning future financial results  product offerings or other events that have not yet occurred 
there are several important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements contained in this discussion and other sections of this form k 
such factors include  but are not limited to the company s ability to achieve profitability  the company s ability to repay its indebtedness to ibm credit  the success of the apple macintosh computer line as well as the success of apple and operating system  the company s ability to compete successfully with apple  company s ability to successfully develop and introduce new products to keep pace with technological innovation  particularly in light of its limited financial resources  the company s ability to compete in its market  the ability of the company s manufacturers and suppliers to deliver components and manufacture the company s products  the company s dependence on international sales and the effect of its exclusive distributor arrangements with respect to europe and japan  and the company s ability to attract and retain its key personnel 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain operational data as a percentage of net sales may not add due to rounding 
year ended september net sales cost of sales operating expenses gross profit research and development selling  general  and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense  net interest expense litigation settlement loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss fiscal to fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this decline was primarily due to the company s efforts to refocus its business which included exiting markets for high volume low margin displays  reduced sales of the company s video and graphics products caused by apple s shift from nubus to pci bus computers  business divestitures and as a result of entering into exclusive distributor arrangements for japan and europe effective april  and july  respectively  which relationships provide for the company to receive as net sales  a percentage of the sales price of each product sold by those distributors as compared to the entire sales price of the product prior to the appointment of the distributor 
the company is highly dependent on the success of apple products as the company s products are designed to provide additional functionality to apple products as compared to the entire sales price of the product prior to the appointment of the distributors 
as a result of the sale by the company of its color server group  the company recorded no net sales of color server products after the second quarter of its fiscal year and recorded approximately million of net sales for the first quarter of its fiscal year 
the company anticipates significantly lower overall net sales in the immediate future as a result of the company s decision to focus its efforts on providing solutions for high end digital video and graphics customers  discontinue selling mass market displays and other low value added products  and the divestiture of certain businesses such as its color server group and macos compatible systems 
the company sold its color server group in january and sold its macos business in february net sales from the color server group were approximately million for fiscal and approximately million for fiscal and net sales from the macos business were approximately million for fiscal and million for fiscal had the net sales of these businesses not been included in the company s net sales for fiscal or fiscal  the company s net sales for such periods would have been approximately million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
while net sales from the company s digital video products increased slightly during the fiscal year  the company anticipates lower revenue from this product line until the introduction of new products now under development 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully develop  introduce and market these new products or that these products will achieve commercial success 
one customer accounted for of the company s net sales for fiscal for fiscal  the same customer accounted for of the company s net sales 
the company s export sales for fiscal were of net sales as compared to of net sales for fiscal net sales could be adversely affected in the future as a result of the exclusive distributor relationships for japan and europe because the company will earn royalties and commissions on any sales to such regions and therefore will only recognize as net sales a portion of the sales price of any product sold through such distributor arrangements 
even if sales for such regions increase or remain similar to historic levels  the company would recognize a lesser amount of net sales for such regions as compared to historic levels 
accordingly  the company anticipates a decline in the percentage of net sales attributable to the asia pacific and european sales regions in connection with the appointments of an exclusive japanese and european distributor and  as described above  the company could also experience a decline in the dollar amount of net sales attributable to such regions 
export sales are also subject to the normal risks associated with doing business in foreign countries such as currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  export controls and other government regulations and  in some countries  a lesser degree of intellectual property protection as compared to that provided under the laws of the united states 
the company hedges substantially all of its trade receivables denominated in foreign currency through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on third party commitments 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on forward contracts are recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations upon contract settlement and were not material in fiscal or gross profit 
the company s gross profit margin was for fiscal  as compared with for fiscal included in fiscal is a one time charge of million resulting from the company s financial restructuring completed in september excluding this one time charge and the restructuring and other charges recorded in fiscal  gross profit margin in fiscal was compared to in fiscal in addition  the color server group had gross profit of approximately million  for fiscal and the color server group and macos business had gross profit loss of approximately million and million  respectively  for fiscal had those businesses not been included in the calculation of the company s gross profit for fiscal and  gross profit for such fiscal years would have been approximately million and million  respectively with a gross profit margin of approximately and  respectively 
the company anticipates continued price reductions and margin pressure within its industry 
the company is responding to these trends by focusing on higher margin products  taking further steps to reduce product costs and controlling expenses 
there can be no assurance that the company s gross margins will recover or remain at current levels 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased from million or of net sales for fiscal to million or of net sales for fiscal the company decreased its research and development expenses primarily by reducing expenses related to headcount resulting from the company s efforts to refocus its business and business divestitures 
the increase in research and development expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales for fiscal  was primarily attributed to the decrease in net sales and the company s refocusing on higher end products  rather than high volume lower margin products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million or of net sales for fiscal to million or of net sales for fiscal the company decreased its selling  general and administrative expenses primarily by reducing expenses related to headcount resulting from the company s efforts to refocus its business and business divestitures 
selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal reflected a reduction of approximately million of merger related restructuring reserves to reflect current requirements 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the building in which the company leases its headquarters was sold 
in connection with the sale  the company terminated its existing lease and entered into a lease with the new owner of the building 
in connection with the final terms of this new lease  expenses in the third quarter of fiscal included a reduction of approximately  of restructuring reserves to reflect current requirements 
the company anticipates that the change of rental terms will help reduce the company s occupancy costs and long term lease obligations 
other income expense  net

interest expense 
interest expense was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to higher average interest rates on higher average borrowings 
provision for income taxes 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes of  for fiscal as compared to a provision for income taxes for fiscal of million 
the provision for fiscal differs from the provision computed utilizing the combined statutory rate in effect during the period primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes 
the fiscal provision differs from the provision computed utilizing the combined statutory rate in effect during the period primarily as a result of the impact of not benefiting the operating losses and the reversal of existing deferred tax assets 
fasb statement provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
the company s valuation allowance reduced the deferred tax asset to the amount realizable 
the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding their realization 
due to the net losses reported in prior years and as a result of the material changes in operations  predictability of earnings in future periods is uncertain 
the company will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis 
as a result of the issuance of common stock and series a convertible preferred stock in exchange for certain liabilities of the company in september  the company experienced a change in ownership as defined under section of the internal revenue code 
accordingly  utilization of substantial net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards will be subject to an approximately million annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions  except under limited circumstances 
this limitation will result in the expiration of all of the tax credit carryforwards and a substantial portion of the net operating loss carryforwards

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
the company s net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal fiscal net sales were reduced by approximately million due to reserves taken by the company in anticipation of future price reductions on a number of its graphics cards  macos compatible systems and other products that are designed for apple s nubus based computers which were largely replaced by apple s pci bus based computers 
during the fiscal year  net sales of graphics cards declined substantially due primarily to reduced demand resulting from apple s incorporation of built in graphics capabilities in its powerpc based macintosh systems 
net sales from displays  accelerator cards and printers also declined during the fiscal year 
these declines were largely offset by sales of macos compatible systems which were first introduced in the fiscal year and by a substantial increase of approximately million in net sales from the company s color server products 
in january  the company completed the sale of its color server business and in february  its macos business 
export sales represented approximately and of net sales for fiscal and  respectively

provision for income taxes

this working line of credit is not expected to provide the company with a significant source of liquidity for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  for the immediate future  the company intends to finance its working capital needs through cash generated from operations  if any 
as described above  the company has minority ownership interests in splash  umax and pdl 
the company has certain registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock of splash owned by it and  as a result  the shares of common stock of splash could provide the company with an additional source of liquidity in the future provided that the retructured loan from ibm credit is first repaid with any proceeds from the sale of the splash securities and that the series a convertible preferred stock has either been redeemed or converted into common stock 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that may affect the company s future results of operations need for additional financing  loan restrictions 
in connection with the plan  ibm credit received  shares of the company s series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in consideration of the cancellation of million of indebtedness to ibm credit and for an additional advance of  in addition  ibm credit has restructured the terms of the remaining approximately million indebtedness into a working line of credit and a term loan 
the company has an up to million working line of credit and ibm credit will extend advances under this line of credit in an amount not to exceed the borrowing base which is defined as i the lesser of of the gross value of eligible inventory or  plus ii of the company s eligible domestic accounts receivable  plus iii the lesser of of the gross value of certain eligible japanese and european accounts receivable or 
the  advanced by ibm credit pursuant to the plan is included in this working line of credit but will not be included in the calculation of the borrowing base 
the initial amount of indebtedness outstanding under this line of credit at september  was million 
the remaining million balance of the company s indebtedness to ibm credit has been converted to a four year term loan 
principal on such term loan will be repaid on a mandatory prepayment schedule 
the restructured loan with ibm credit is subject to mandatory prepayment as follows i upon the disposition of any assets of the company outside of the ordinary course of business  all net proceeds to the company must be applied towards the company s obligations under the loan  ii upon the closing of any financing  of the proceeds must be applied towards the company s obligations under the loan  iii upon the thirtieth day following the end of each fiscal quarter  an amount of no less than of operating cash flow for such prior fiscal quarter must be applied towards the company s obligations under the loan  and iv upon the receipt of any other amounts other than sales of inventory or used or obsolete equipment in the ordinary course of business  and not otherwise described in the preceding clause i iii  all of such amounts must be applied towards the company s obligations under the loan 
if the company s obligations under the term loan  as well as finance charges and amounts outstanding in excess of the borrowing base described above under the working line of credit  are repaid  ibm credit can require such proceeds to be applied towards a redemption of the series a convertible preferred stock 
in addition  the company is required to deposit its revenues in accounts controlled by ibm credit 
at any time  regardless of whether the company is in default of its obligations to ibm credit  ibm credit is permitted to apply these amounts towards the repayment of any of the company s obligations to ibm credit 
as a result of ibm credit s control over the company s cash flow and these prepayment and redemption provisions  together with the other terms and covenants of the restructured loan agreement  the company s ability to generate working capital or to undertake a variety of other merger  disposition or financing activities will be substantially restricted 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that may affect the company s future results of operations need for additional financing  loan restrictions 
as a result of ibm s control over the company s cash flow and these restrictions on the company s excess cash flow  the company anticipates that it will not have significant cash available for expenditures other than for its ordinary course of business operating expenses 
in the event the company were unable to generate sufficient net sales or if the company incurs unforeseen operating expenses  it may not be able to meet its operating expenses without additional financing or a restructuring of its loan agreements with ibm credit 
in the event that the company desired to acquire any strategic technologies or businesses  it would probably be unable to do so without obtaining additional financing or the consent of ibm credit 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that may affect the company s future results of operations need for additional financing  loan restrictions 
because of the company s loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company failed to comply with several financial covenants of its restructured loan agreement with ibm credit specifically  revenues to working capital ratio  net profits to revenues ratio and working capital 
the company obtained a waiver from ibm credit of this noncompliance through december  there can be no assurance that ibm credit will grant any additional waivers in the event that the company fails to comply with these financial covenants in the future 
based on preliminary results for the three months ended december   the company believes that it will be in breach of these covenants as of such date 
based on the value of certain assets which secure the restructured loan  among other considerations  ibm credit will grant a waiver of these defaults  but there can be no assurance that ibm credit will continue to do so 
previously  the company funded its operations through the public and private sale of equity securities  bank loans and cash flow from operations 
the company completed a private placement during the third quarter of the fiscal year  the proceeds of which were utilized to build inventory of macos compatible systems components and reduce other vendor payables 
this business never generated a positive gross margin and the company subsequently sold its macos business in february see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that may affect the company s future results of operations need for additional financing  loan restrictions 
in this private placement  the company sold  shares of its common stock resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
other than the loan from ibm credit  the company currently has no other bank loans 
capital expenditures were approximately million during fiscal and were million in fiscal and million in fiscal and were primarily for leasehold improvements and upgrading the company s management information systems 
the company has no present plans for any significant amount of capital expenditures in the future 
at september   the company s principal commitments consisted of obligations under its restructured loan agreement with ibm credit and its obligations under building and capital leases 
see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
the company is also a party to various litigation proceedings  the costs of defending which or the outcome of which could adversely affect the company s liquidity 
see business legal proceedings 
recently  the company s limited cash resources have restricted the company s ability to purchase inventory which in turn has limited its ability to procure and sell products and has resulted in additional costs for expedited deliveries 
the adverse effect on the company s results of operations due to its limited cash resources can be expected to continue until such time as the company is able to return to profitability  or generate additional cash from other sources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
the company believes it has sufficient funds to finance its operations for the next months 
however  the level of operations which it believes will be able to sustain for the next months will be significantly lower than historical periods  particularly in the research and development  sales and marketing and general administrative areas 
additional funds will be needed to finance the company s operations  product development plans and for other purposes if the company s operating expenses are higher than anticipated 
during fiscal  additional financing will also be required if the company desires to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
while the company plans to generate cash by divesting certain liquid assets and is investigating possible financing opportunities  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  that the terms of such financing will not adversely affect the company s results of operations 
certain factors that may affect the company s future results of operations a number of uncertainties exist that could affect the company s future operating results  including  without limitation  the following continuing operating losses the company experienced operating losses in each of its prior three fiscal years 
in the future  the company s ability to achieve and subsequently sustain profitable operations will depend upon a number of factors  including the company s ability to control costs  the company s ability to service its outstanding indebtedness to ibm credit  the company s ability to realize appreciation in minority ownership interests in splash technology holdings  inc and other investments  the company s ability to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain additional funds to fund its operating expenses  the company s ability to develop innovative and cost competitive new products and to bring those products to market in a timely manner  the commercial acceptance of apple computers and the macos and the rate and mix of apple computers and related products sold  competitive factors such as new product introductions  product enhancements and aggressive marketing and pricing practices  general economic conditions  and other factors 
the company has faced and expects to continue to face increased competition in graphic cards as a result of apple s transition of its product line to the pci bus 
for these and other reasons  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or subsequently maintain profitability in the near term  if at all 
fluctuations in operating results the company has experienced substantial fluctuations in operating results 
the company s customers generally order on an as needed basis  and the company has historically operated with relatively small backlogs 
quarterly sales and operating results depend heavily on the volume and timing of bookings received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues are derived from sales made late in each quarter  which increases the difficulty in forecasting sales accurately 
since the end of the company s fiscal year  shortages of available cash have restricted the company s ability to purchase inventory and have delayed the company s receipt of products from suppliers and increased shipping and other costs 
furthermore  because of its financial condition  the company believes that many suppliers are hesitant to continue their relationships with or extend credit terms to the company and potential new suppliers are reluctant to provide goods to the company 
the company recognizes sales upon shipment of product  and allowances are recorded for estimated uncollectable amounts  returns  credits and similar costs  including product warranties and price protection 
due to the inherent uncertainty of such estimates  there can be no assurance that the company s forecasts regarding bookings  collections  rates of return  credits and related matters will be accurate 
a significant portion of the operating expenses of the company are relatively fixed in nature  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts which  as indicated above  are uncertain 
any inability on the part of the company to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for any failure to meet sales forecasts or to receive anticipated collections  or any unexpected increase in product returns or other costs  could also have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
as a strategic response to a changing competitive environment  the company has elected  and  in the future  may elect from time to time  to make certain pricing  service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  the company completed a variety of business divestitures during fiscal  restructured the terms of its indebtedness to ibm credit and issued a substantial amount of equity in the company to its creditors in satisfaction of approximately million in claims and indebtedness during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations will not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would be likely to be materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
need for additional financing  loan restrictions the company intends to finance its working capital needs through cash generated by operations  sales of liquid assets and borrowings under a restructured working line of credit with ibm credit 
because the company has experienced operating losses in each of its prior four fiscal years  the company must significantly reduce operating expenses and or significantly increase net sales in order to finance its working capital needs with cash generated by operations 
furthermore  pursuant to the restructured loan with ibm credit  the company is required to deposit its revenues in accounts subject to control by ibm credit 
at any time  regardless of whether the company is in default of its obligations to ibm credit  ibm credit is permitted to apply these amounts towards the repayment of any of the company s obligations to ibm credit 
this loan is also subject to mandatory prepayment as follows i upon the disposition of any assets of the company outside of the ordinary course of business  all net proceeds to the company must be applied towards the company s obligations under the loan  ii upon the closing of any financing  of the proceeds must be applied towards the company s obligations under the loan  iii upon the thirtieth day following the end of each fiscal quarter  an amount of no less than of operating cash flow for such prior fiscal quarter must be applied towards the company s obligations under the loan  and iv upon the receipt of any other amounts other than sales of inventory or used or obsolete equipment in the ordinary course of business  and not otherwise described in the preceding clause i iii  all of such amounts must be applied towards the company s obligations under the loan 
if the company s obligations under the term loan  as well as finance charges and amounts outstanding in excess of the borrowing base described below under the working line of credit described below  are repaid  ibm credit can require such proceeds to be applied towards a redemption of the series a convertible preferred stock 
ibm credit s control over the company s financial resources as well as these prepayment provisions will place a further strain on the ability of the company to fund its working capital needs internally 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully fund its working capital needs internally 
the restructured loan also provides for a working line of credit of up to million 
however  the company will only be able to borrow amounts up to the borrowing base which is defined as the sum of i the lesser of of the gross value of eligible inventory or  plus ii of the value of eligible domestic accounts receivable  plus iii the lesser of of the gross value of certain japanese and european accounts receivable or  upon the closing of the restructured loan  approximately million  or an amount equal to the current borrowing base was deemed to be outstanding under this line of credit 
therefore  in order to draw on this working line of credit  the company will need to increase the amount of the borrowing base by increasing the amount of certain of its accounts receivable or repay amounts outstanding under this line of credit 
because most of the company s cash flow must be applied towards prepayment of the term loan and  towards the redemption of the series a convertible preferred stock  prior to reducing any amounts outstanding under the working line of credit  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to significantly reduce this working line of credit 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that this working line of credit will provide a significant source of working capital 
the company s ability to sell assets in order to satisfy its working capital needs will also be restricted by the terms of the series a convertible preferred stock and the terms of the restructured loan 
the series a convertible preferred stock will be redeemable at the option of ibm credit upon certain dispositions and  as described above  the company is required to apply the proceeds of any disposition towards repayment of the term loan component of the restructured loan 
the restructured loan also imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on the company and requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants such as minimum cash flow levels  restricts the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  create liens  sell assets or engage in mergers or acquisitions  or make certain capital expenditures 
the failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default under the loan  which is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
in the event of such a default  ibm credit could elect to declare all of the funds borrowed pursuant thereto to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest proceeding and to apply all amounts on deposit in the company s bank accounts  which could result in the company becoming a debtor in a bankruptcy 
the loan restrictions could limit the ability of the company to effect future financings or otherwise restrict corporate activities 
even if additional financing could be obtained  there can be no assurance that it would be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to the company 
as of september   the company was not in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the restructured loan agreement specifically  revenues to working capital ratio  net profits to revenues ratio and working capital however  ibm credit has waived such defaults 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
based on preliminary results for the three months ended december   the company believes that it will be in default with these covenants as of such date 
based on the value of certain assets which secure the restructured loan  among other considerations  ibm credit will grant a waiver of these defaults  although there can be no assurance that ibm credit will continue to do so 
the restructured loan may also limit the company s ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  insofar as such conditions may affect the financial condition and financing requirements of the company 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future  it may be required to refinance all or a portion of its existing indebtedness to ibm credit which indebtedness can be repaid without prepayment penalties or to obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to the company 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
volatility of stock price immediately prior to the consummation of the plan  the company had outstanding approximately  shares of common stock  most of which were freely tradeable 
upon the effectiveness of the registration statement relating to the resale of the securities issued pursuant to the plan  the number of freely tradeable shares of common stock increased by almost and  upon the conversion of the series a convertible preferred stock  up to an additional  shares may be eligible for public resale  an increase of almost from the number of outstanding shares of common stock prior to the consummation of the plan 
furthermore  none of the creditors who received shares of common stock pursuant to the plan have entered into any agreements restricting their ability to resell the shares of common stock which they received 
as a result of this substantially larger public float  it is likely that a substantial number of creditors may seek to resell their shares at times when there is an insufficient demand for shares of common stock 
in such an event  the trading price of the common stock will be materially and adversely affected 
the company believes that sales by former creditors have played a significant role in the decline of the trading price of the common stock since november the price of the company s common stock has fluctuated widely in the past 
management believes that such fluctuations may have been caused by announcements of new products  quarterly fluctuations in the results of operations and other factors  including changes in conditions of the personal computer industry in general and of apple computer in particular  changes in the company s results of operations and financial condition and recent sales of large numbers of shares of common stock by former creditors of the company 
stock markets  and stocks of technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by the company and other high technology companies  often for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
due to the factors referred to herein  the dynamic nature of the company s industry  general economic conditions  the substantially larger number of freely tradeable shares of common stock held by former creditors of the company and other factors  the company s future operating results and stock prices may be subject to significant volatility in the future 
such stock price volatility for the common stock has in the past provoked securities litigation  and future volatility could provoke litigation in the future that could divert substantial management resources and have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations litigation settlement 
dependence on and competition with apple historically  substantially all of the company s products have been designed for and sold to users of apple personal computers  and it is expected that sales of products for such computers will continue to represent substantially all of the sales of the company for the foreseeable future 
the company s operating results would be adversely affected if apple should continue to lose market share  if macintosh sales were to decline further or if other developments were to adversely affect apple s business 
furthermore  any difficulty that may be experienced by apple in the development  manufacturing  marketing or sale of its computers  or other disruptions to  or uncertainty in the market regarding  apple s business  resulting from these or other factors could result in reduced demand for apple computers  which in turn could materially and adversely affect sales of the company s products 
recently  apple has announced large losses  management changes  headcount reductions  and other significant events which have led or could lead to uncertainty in the market regarding apple s business and products 
in addition  news reports indicating that apple may be or may have been the target of merger  acquisition  or takeover negotiations  have led or could lead to uncertainty in the market regarding apple s business and products 
as software applications for the color publishing and multimedia markets become more available on platforms other than macintosh  it is likely that these other platforms will continue to gain acceptance in these markets 
for example  newer versions of the windows operating environment support high performance graphics and video applications similar to those offered on the macintosh 
there is a risk that this trend will reduce the support given to macintosh products by third party developers and could substantially reduce demand for macintosh products and peripherals over the long term 
a number of the company s products compete with products marketed by apple 
as a competitor of the company  apple could in the future take steps to hinder the company s development of compatible products and slow sales of the company s products 
the company s business is based in part on supplying products that meet the needs of high end customers that are not fully met by apple s products 
as apple improves its products or bundles additional hardware or software into its computers  it reduces the market for radius products that provide those capabilities 
for example  the company believes that the on board performance capabilities included in macintosh power pc products have reduced and continue to reduce overall sales for the company s graphics cards 
in the past  the company has developed new products as apple s progress has rendered existing company products obsolete 
however  in light of the company s current financial condition there can be no assurance that the company will continue to develop new products on a timely basis or that any such products will be successful 
in order to develop products for the macintosh on a timely basis  the company depends upon access to advance information concerning new macintosh products 
a decision by apple to cease sharing advance product information with the company would adversely affect the company s business 
new products anticipated from and introduced by apple could cause customers to defer or alter buying decisions due to uncertainty in the marketplace  as well as presenting additional direct competition for the company 
for example  the company believes that apple s transition during to power pc products caused delays and uncertainties in the marketplace and had the effect of reducing demand for the company s products 
in addition  sales of the company s products have been adversely affected by apple s revamping of its entire product line from nubus based to pci bus based computers 
in the past  transitions in apple s products have been accompanied by shortages in those products and in key components for them  leading to a slowdown in sales of those products and in the development and sale by the company of compatible products 
in addition  it is possible that the introduction of new apple products with improved performance capabilities may create uncertainties in the market concerning the need for the performance enhancements provided by the company s products and could reduce demand for such products 
competition the markets for the company s products are highly competitive  and the company expects competition to intensify 
many of the company s current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
the company believes that its ability to compete will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of financial resources available to the company  its ability to repay its indebtedness to ibm credit  success and timing of new product developments by the company and its competitors  product performance  price and quality  breadth of distribution and customer support 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully with respect to these factors 
in addition  the introduction of lower priced competitive products could result in price reductions that would adversely affect the company s results of operations 
see business competition 
dependence on limited number of manufacturers and suppliers the company outsources the manufacturing and assembly of its products to third party manufacturers 
although the company uses a number of manufacturer assemblers  each of its products is manufactured and assembled by a single manufacturer 
the failure of a manufacturer to ship the quantities of a product ordered by the company could cause a material disruption in the company s sales of that product 
in the past  most recently in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company has experienced substantial delays in its ability to fill customer orders for displays and other products  due to the inability of certain manufacturers to meet their volume and schedule requirements and  more recently  due to the company s shortages in available cash 
such shortages have caused some manufacturers to put the company on a cash or prepay basis and or to require the company to provide security for their risk in procuring components or reserving manufacturing time  and there is a risk that manufacturers will discontinue their relationship with the company 
in the past  most recently the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company has been vulnerable to delays in shipments from manufacturers because the company has sought to manage its use of working capital by  among other things  limiting the backlog of inventory it purchases 
more recently  this vulnerability has been exacerbated by the company s shortages in cash reserves 
delays in shipments from manufacturers can cause fluctuations in the company s short term results and contribute to order cancellations 
the company currently has arranged payment terms for certain of its major manufacturers such that certain of the company s major customers pay these manufacturers directly for products ordered and shipped 
in the event these customers do not pay these manufacturers  there can be no assurance that such manufacturers will not cease supplying the company 
in addition  as a condition to continuing its manufacturing arrangement with the company  the company granted mitsubishi electronics  the manufacturer of the company s pressview products  a security interest in all of the company s technology and intellectual property rights related to and incorporated into the company s pressview products 
there can be no assurance that other manufacturers will not require special terms in order to continue their relationship with the company 
the company is also dependent on sole or limited source suppliers for certain key components used in its products  including certain digital to analog converters  digital video chips  color calibrated monitors and other products 
certain other semiconductor components and molded plastic parts are also purchased from sole or limited source suppliers 
the company purchases these sole or limited source components primarily pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business and has no guaranteed supply arrangements with sole or limited source suppliers 
therefore  these suppliers are not obligated to supply products to the company for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
although the company expects that these suppliers will continue to meet its requirements for the components  there can be no assurance that they will do so  particularly in light of the company s financial condition 
the company s reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves a number of risks  including the absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability or interruption in the supply of key components and reduced control over delivery schedules and costs 
the company expects to continue to rely on a limited number of suppliers for the foreseeable future 
if these suppliers became unwilling or unable to continue to provide these components the company would have to develop alternative sources for these components which could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
certain suppliers  due to the company s shortages in available cash  have put the company on a cash or prepay basis and or required the company to provide security for their risk in procuring components or reserving manufacturing time  and there is a risk that suppliers will discontinue their relationship with the company 
the introduction of new products presents additional difficulties in obtaining timely shipments from suppliers 
additional time may be needed to identify and qualify suppliers of the new products 
also  the company has experienced delays in achieving volume production of new products due to the time required for suppliers to build their manufacturing capacity 
an extended interruption in the supply of any of the components for the company s products  regardless of the cause  could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company s products also incorporate components  such as vrams  drams and asics that are available from multiple sources but have been subject to substantial fluctuations in availability and price 
since a substantial portion of the total material cost of the company s products is represented by these components  significant fluctuations in their price and availability could affect its results of operations 
as a result of the consummation of the plan  certain suppliers and manufacturers agreed to settle amounts owed by the company for an amount substantially less than the amount of the balance owed 
accordingly  certain suppliers and manufacturers may be reluctant to continue to do business with the company in the future 
technological change  continuing need to develop new products the personal computer industry in general  and color publishing and video applications within the industry  are characterized by rapidly changing technology  often resulting in short product life cycles and rapid price declines 
the company believes that its success will be highly dependent on its ability to develop innovative and cost competitive new products and to bring them to the marketplace in a timely manner 
should the company fail to introduce new products on a timely basis  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
technological innovation is particularly important for the company  since its business is based on its ability to provide functionality and features not included in apple s products 
as apple introduces new products with increased functionality and features  the company s business will be adversely affected unless it develops new products that provide advantages over apple s latest offerings 
as a result of the company s financial condition  it has had to significantly reduce its research and development expenditures 
for the fiscal year  the company spent approximately million on research and development as compared with approximately million for the prior fiscal year 
furthermore  as described in need for additional financing  loan restrictions  the terms of the restructured loan with ibm credit will restrict the company s ability to fund its working capital needs and  as a result  the ability of the company to maintain historical levels of research and development expenditures 
continued reduction in the available cash resources of the company could result in the interruption or cancellation of research and product development efforts which would have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
the company anticipates that the video editing industry will follow the pattern of the professional publishing industry in which desktop publishing products  including those produced by radius  replaced more expensive  proprietary products  and the company also anticipates that this evolution will lead to an increase in the purchase and use of video editing products 
as a result  the company has devoted significant resources to this product line 
there can be no assurance that this evolution will occur in the video editing industry as expected by the company  or that even if it does occur that it will not occur at a slower pace than anticipated 
there can also be no assurance that any video editing products developed by the company will achieve consumer acceptance or broad commercial success 
for example  the company initially began its macos compatible systems business in the third quarter of fiscal and devoted substantial financial resources  including raising approximately million in a private placement of its common stock and borrowing an additional million from ibm credit  and incurring significant research and development and sales and marketing expenses 
this business was never profitable and the company sold this line of business in february in the event that the increased use of such video editing products does not occur or in the event that the company is unable to successfully develop and market such products  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
the introduction of new products is inherently subject to risks of delay 
should the company fail to introduce new products on a timely basis  the operating results of the company could be adversely affected 
the introduction of new products and the phasing out of older products will require the company to carefully manage its inventory to avoid inventory obsolescence and may require increases in inventory write down reserves 
the long lead times as much as three to five months associated with the procurement of certain components principally displays and asics exposes the company to greater risk in forecasting the demand for new products 
there can be no assurance that the company s forecasts regarding new product demand and its estimates of appropriate inventory levels will be accurate 
moreover  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to cause all of its new products to be manufactured at acceptable manufacturing yields  that the company will obtain market acceptance for these products or that potential manufacturers will not be hesitant to manufacture such new products as a result of the company s financial condition 
dependence on indirect distribution channels the company s primary means of distribution is through a limited number of third party distributors and master resellers that are not under the direct control of the company 
furthermore  the company relies on one exclusive distributor for its sales in each of japan and europe 
the company does not maintain a direct sales force 
as a result  the company s business and financial results are highly dependent on the amount of the company s products that is ordered by these distributors and resellers 
such orders are in turn dependent upon the continued viability and financial condition of these distributors and resellers as well as on their ability to resell such products and maintain appropriate inventory levels 
furthermore  many of these distributors and resellers generally carry the product lines of a number of companies  are not subject to minimum order requirements and can discontinue marketing the company s products at any time 
accordingly  the company must compete for the focus and sales efforts of these third parties 
because certain of the company s major suppliers have arrangements with the company pursuant to which certain of the company s major customers are responsible for payment of goods sent to the company  the company is dependent on certain resellers to make payments to its suppliers 
in addition  due in part to the historical volatility of the personal computer industry  certain of the company s resellers have from time to time experienced declining profit margins  cash flow shortages and other financial difficulties 
the future growth and success of the company will continue to depend in large part upon its indirect distribution channels  including its reseller channels 
if its resellers or other distributors were to experience financial difficulties  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
international sales prior to the second fiscal quarter of  the company s international sales were primarily made through distributors and the company s subsidiary in japan 
effective april  and july  the company appointed an exclusive distributor for japan and europe  respectively 
the company expects that international sales  particularly sales to japan  will represent a significant portion of its business activity and that it will be subject to the normal risks of international sales such as currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  export controls and other governmental regulations and  in some countries  a lesser degree of intellectual property protection as compared to that provided under the laws of the united states 
in addition  demand for the company s products in japan could be affected by the transition of its japanese sales and marketing efforts from radius subsidiary to a distributor 
furthermore  a reduction in sales efforts or financial viability of this distributor could adversely affect the company s net sales and its ability to provide service and support to japanese customers 
additionally  fluctuations in exchange rates could affect demand for the company s products 
if for any reason exchange or price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies are imposed  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
net sales could also be adversely affected in the future as a result of the exclusive distributor relationships for japan and europe because the company will only recognize as net sales a portion of the sales price of any product sold through such distributor arrangements 
accordingly  even if sales for such regions increase or remain similar to historic levels  the company would recognize a lesser amount of net sales for such regions as compared to historic levels 
dependence on key personnel the company s success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of its key management  marketing  product development and operational personnel and the company s ability to retain and continue to attract highly skilled personnel 
the company does not carry any key person life insurance with respect to any of its personnel 
competition for employees in the computer industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain qualified employees 
many members of the company s management have departed within the past year  including its former chief financial officer and three other vice presidents  and the company has also had substantial layoffs and other employee departures 
in addition  the company s current chief financial officer has announced her intention to resign in the near future 
because of the company s financial difficulties  it has become increasingly difficult for it to hire new employees and retain key management and current employees 
moreover  because voting control of the company rests in the hands of the company s former creditors could  if acting together  effectuate changes in board composition or management 
dependence on proprietary rights the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection  nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
the company has a number of patents and patent applications and intends to file additional patent applications as it considers appropriate 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of these pending applications or  if patents do issue  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any patents that may be issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any rights granted thereunder would provide proprietary protection to the company 
the company has a number of trademarks and trademark applications 
there can be no assurance that litigation with respect to trademarks will not result from the company s use of registered or common law marks  or that  if litigation against the company were successful  any resulting loss of the right to use a trademark would not reduce sales of the company s products in addition to the possibility of a significant damages award 
although  the company intends to defend its proprietary rights  policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology or products is difficult  and there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will be successful 
the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the proprietary rights of the company to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the company has received  and may receive in the future  communications asserting that its products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties  and the company is engaged and has been engaged in litigation alleging that the company s products infringe others patent rights 
as a result of such claims or litigation  it may become necessary or desirable in the future for the company to obtain licenses relating to one or more of its products or relating to current or future technologies  and there can be no assurance that it would be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms 
see business patents and licenses 
control by creditors after the consummation of the plan  the company s unsecured creditors and ibm credit owned in the aggregate approximately of the voting power of the company assuming exercise of all available options  such creditors would own approximately of the voting power of the company 
ibm credit owns approximately of the company s voting power and the committee members own approximately of the voting power of the company 
the company s four largest unsecured creditors  sci technology  inc  mitsubishi electronics  hamilton hallmark avnet co 
and manufacturers services limited  inc own approximately   and  respectively  of the voting power of the company 
all of the company s creditors acting together would have voting control of the management and direction of the company and could also impede a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving the company or discourage a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company 
the committee members have acted cooperatively with respect to the negotiation of the plan  and the company expects such creditors to continue to act cooperatively with respect to their ownership of the company s securities 
one committee member  carl carlson of mitsubishi electronics joined the board of directors in september the company also intends to continue to do business with many of its unsecured creditors  including mitsubishi electronics and sci technology  inc  each of whom beneficially own more than of the company s common stock 
as a result  such creditors may be able to influence the terms of any business relationship between the company and such creditor 
shares eligible for future sale sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the company s common stock 
as of november   the effective date of the registration statement on form s with respect to the securities issued pursuant to the plan the effective date  there were approximately  shares of common stock outstanding  substantially all of which are available for sale without restriction under the securities act of  as amended the act as compared with approximately  shares of common stock outstanding as of august  except for those shares which are held by affiliates of the company 
if the series a convertible preferred stock is converted and if outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock are exercised  up to an additional  shares including  shares issuable pursuant to the rights will be available for sale in the public market 
the tradability of such shares of common stock could materially and adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
see volatility of stock price 
in addition  the company is required to pay on a quarterly basis an annual dividend of  or per share on the series a convertible preferred stock 
this dividend may be paid in cash or common stock of the company 
depending upon its financial position on any dividend payment date  such dividends may be paid in the form of shares of common stock instead of cash 
in the event such dividend is fully paid in shares of common stock  a number of shares having a market value of up to  the amount of such quarterly dividend  will be issued each quarter 
based on the closing price of per share on december   an additional  shares could be issuable as a dividend on the series a convertible preferred stock at the end of each quarter 
the company has registered under the act  common stock having a market value of  representing the first eight quarterly dividend payments in the event that such dividend is paid in common stock 
such shares will be freely tradable 
subsequent dividends in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the provisions of rule  including the holding period requirements 
as of september   there were  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding options by employees and consultants 
as of such date there were an additional  shares of common stock available for issuance under options to be granted to employees and consultants and  shares reserved for issuances for purchases under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
additionally   shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the company s stock option plans for non employee directors   of which were subject to outstanding options 
the company has amended its stock option plan the plan to increase the number of shares available for issuance thereunder by  shares  subject to shareholder approval at its annual meeting of shareholders in february in accordance with the terms of the debt to equity exchange consummated in september  the plan will be further amended or a new plan adopted in the event that the series a convertible preferred stock is converted into common stock so that an aggregate of  shares of common stock are covered by the plan as amended and or any additional plan 
the company may also seek to obtain board and or shareholder approval for grants of options in excess of the amounts described above 
all of the shares of common stock to be issued upon exercise of options granted or to be granted or upon stock purchases will be available for sale in the public market  subject to the rule volume limitations applicable to affiliates 
such availability will further increase the number of freely tradeable shares of common stock outstanding which could exert downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock 
in the event that the series a convertible preferred stock is not converted or the warrants to purchase  shares of common stock are not exercised during the two years following the effective date  the holders of such securities have demand registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a convertible preferred stock or upon exercise of the warrants which were not converted or exercised during such period 
ibm credit also has demand registration rights with respect to any shares of common stock which are paid in lieu of cash dividends on the series a convertible preferred stock after such two year period 
these demand registration rights will permit such holders to cause the company  on up to two occasions  to register such unsold shares of underlying common stock commencing november  all expenses incurred in connection with such registrations other than underwriters discounts and commissions will be borne by the company 
these registration rights will expire once all the securities covered thereby may be sold pursuant to rule in a three month period without registration 
such expiration date will be no earlier than september possible delisting of common stock from nasdaq smallcap market the company s common stock is listed on the nasdaq smallcap market pursuant to an agreement with the nasd which requires that the company comply with the continued listing requirements for the nasdaq smallcap market 
failure to meet the continued listing requirements in the future would subject the common stock to delisting 
as described under business recent developments nasdaq national market delisting  the common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market if the company fails to maintain capital and surplus of million or  if the trading price of the common stock remains below per share  the company will be required to maintain capital and surplus of million 
because of the substantial losses experienced by the company for fiscal  any significant loss experienced in a subsequent quarter could cause the company to have insufficient capital and surplus for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
because of the substantial increase in the number of tradable shares of common stock  there could be continued downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock which has not traded over per share for the entire month of december  which makes it less likely that the company will meet the minimum bid price requirement for the nasdaq smallcap market and  as a result  the company would need to maintain capital and surplus of million 
furthermore under the proposed new continued listing requirements of the nasdaq national market and the nasdaq smallcap market  any securities with a trading price of less than per share would become subject to delisting  regardless of capital and surplus 
if the company s common stock is delisted  there can be no assurance that the company will meet the requirements for initial inclusion in the future  particularly the current minimum per share bid requirement 
trading  if any  in the listed securities after delisting would be conducted in the over the counter market in what are commonly referred to as the pink sheets 
as a result  investors may find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations as to the value of  the company s securities
