item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of operations  including trends which might appear  are not necessarily indicative of future operations 
the discussion of the company s results of operations reported in the consolidated statements of operations compares the years ended december  and  as well as december  and certain comparisons between the periods are made on a percentage basis as well as on a weighted average gross leasable area gla basis  a technique which adjusts for certain increases or decreases in the number of centers and corresponding square feet related to the development and expansion or disposition of rental properties 
the computation of weighted average gla  however  does not adjust for fluctuations in occupancy throughout each year shown since gla is not reduced when original occupied space subsequently becomes vacant 
general overview the company continues to grow principally through the development of new factory outlet centers  acquisitions and expansion of existing centers 
during  the company completed six expansions totalling  square feet 
in addition  construction has commenced on the initial phase of a new center in riverhead  new york totalling approximately  square feet 
during  the company substantially completed two new centers and expanded four existing centers 
total square feet opened in  including completion of certain projects that commenced at the end of  was  square feet

cautionary statements the discussion below contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of which reflect management s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the effects of future events on the company s financial performance  the risk that the company may not be able to finance its planned development activities  risks related to the retail industry in which the company s outlet centers compete  including the potential adverse impact of external factors such as inflation  tenant demand for space  consumer confidence  unemployment rates and consumer tastes and preferences  risks associated with the company s development activities  such as the potential for cost overruns  delays and lack of predictability with respect to the financial returns associated with these development activities  the risk of potential increase in market interest rates from current rates  risks associated with real estate ownership  such as the potential adverse impact of changes in the local economic climate on the revenues and the value of the company s properties  and the risks that a significant number of tenants may become unable to meet their lease obligations or that the company may be unable to renew or re lease a significant amount of available space on economically favorable terms 
results of operations compared to base rentals increased million  or  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in primarily as a result of a increase in weighted average gla 
base rentals per weighted average gla decreased less than from per square foot to per square foot reflecting a slightly lower average occupancy rate during compared to the increase in base rents in consists of million associated with leases added during and million related to the effect of a full year s operation of centers opened in percentage rentals decreased  or  in compared to and percentage rentals per weighted average gla declined 
per square foot  or  as a result of the dilutive effect of the increase in additional square footage associated with the expansions since tenant sales at centers in their first year of operation often do not reach the level on which percentage rentals are required the breakpoint 
the decrease is also a result of escalating breakpoints in certain leases renewing at existing centers without comparable increases in sales 
tenant sales per square foot for centers which were opened all of and increased to approximately per square foot 
expense reimbursements  which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance  operating  property tax  promotional and management expenses  increased million during as compared to the same period in due principally to the related increase in reimbursable operating and maintenance expenses associated with the growth in gla 
expense reimbursements expressed as a percent of property operating expenses were in the period compared to in the period due to certain contractual increases and reductions in nonrecoverable operating and maintenance expenses 
property operating expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to on a weighted average gla basis  property operating expenses decreased from per square foot to per square foot primarily due to a reduction in advertising and promotion expenses reflecting the company s use of cost efficient means in advertising and promoting its centers 
the decrease was partially offset by increases in real estate taxes as a result of reassessments of recently completed properties  particularly the property in riverhead  ny 
general and administrative expenses decreased on a weighted average gla basis to for the year ended general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased to in compared to in aggregate interest expense increased million and 
per weighted average gla during period as compared to the increase is due to higher average borrowings outstanding during the period associated with the growth in gla and due to a higher average interest rate under the senior unsecured notes issued in march when compared with the short term lines of credit previously utilized 
depreciation and amortization per weighted average gla increased from per square foot to per square foot primarily due to increases in tenant finishing allowances included in building and improvements which are depreciated over shorter lives and the accelerated depreciation of certain tenant finishing allowances related to tenants who vacated or terminated their lease prior to the expiration of the lease term 
the extraordinary item represents the write off of previously deferred financing costs of  in connection with the early retirement of debt with the proceeds from the senior unsecured notes issued in march compared to base rentals increased million  or  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in primarily as a result of a increase in weighted average gla as well as the impact of leases renewing at higher base rental rates 
the increase in base rents in consists of million associated with leases added during  million related to the effect of a full year s operation of centers opened in  and  related to rental renewals in previously established outlet centers 
percentage rents increased approximately  for the year ended december  over the same period in however  percentage rents per weighted average gla declined as a result of the dilutive effect of the increase in additional square footage associated with the new centers since tenant sales at centers opening during the year often do not reach the level where percentage rents are required and due to a changing mix in the amount of base and percentage rents on leases renewing at existing centers 
tenant sales per square foot for centers which were opened all of and were virtually the same as the prior year at approximately per square foot 
expense reimbursements  which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance  operating  property tax  promotional and management expenses  increased million during as compared to the same period in due principally to the related increase in reimbursable property operating expenses associated with the growth in gla 
expense reimbursements expressed as a percent of property operating expenses were in the period compared to in the period primarily as a result of certain contractual increases 
property operating expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to on a weighted average gla basis  property operating expenses decreased from per square foot to per square foot 
new developments usually carry a higher than average cost per square foot until all the square footage for that center is open for the entire period 
fewer new centers were opened in as compared to the significant amount of openings in the period  contributing to the favorable decrease in property operating expenses per weighted average gla in compared to excluding the new centers which were opened in  property operating expenses increased  or 
per square foot  due primarily to additional advertising and promotion expenses  which reflect the company s strategy to more actively promote its centers  and increases in real estate taxes 
general and administrative expenses decreased on a weighted average gla basis to for the year ended and decreased from to of total revenues reflecting continued economies of scale achieved through controlling expenses despite the continued development and growth in gla 
financing the company s development resulted in further utilization of long term borrowings and aggregate interest expense increased million during as compared to the incremental borrowings in of million  resulting from the record development that year  did not significantly impact interest expense due to the effect of capitalizing the related interest costs during the construction period 
however  the completion of those projects  combined with the impact of an additional million of borrowings in  is reflected in the increase in interest expense per weighted average gla from per square foot in to per square foot in depreciation and amortization per weighted average gla increased due primarily to increases in costs associated with site preparation and improvements in the layout and design of new centers as well as increased tenant finishing allowances included in building and improvements which are depreciated over shorter lives 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases for all three years were primarily due to the incremental operating income associated with new development 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to  and million during  and which reflects the lower levels of development over the past two years  square feet developed in   square feet in and  square feet in 
due to the lower levels of construction activity  cash provided by financing activities has also decreased from in to and in and during and  the company slowed its pace of new development in response to a soft retail environment and lower tenant demand 
in turn  management concentrated its efforts on expanding and enhancing land in the current portfolio while at the same time diligently searching for new sites which will maximize value to both the company s shareholders and tenants 
however  management believes  based upon its discussions with present and prospective tenants  that many companies  including new entrants into the factory outlet business  desire to open a number of new factory outlet stores in the next several years  particularly where there are successful factory outlet centers in which such companies do not have a significant presence or where there are few factory outlet centers 
construction has begun on a second property in riverhead  ny expected to begin opening in spring totalling approximately  square feet 
upon total build out of this development over the next several years  the combined gla of both properties should total approximately  square feet  making this outlet shopping center one of the largest in the nation 
in addition  the company is in the preleasing stages of three new sites located in concord  nc charlotte  romulus  mi detroit and ashburn  va washington  dc and on february   completed the purchase of an existing factory outlet center containing approximately  square feet for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the company also is in the process of developing plans for additional expansions and new centers for completion in and beyond and will consider other acquisitions that are suitable for its portfolio 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these anticipated or planned developments or expansions will be started or completed as scheduled  or that any acquisitions will be made 
commitments for construction underway as of december  which represent only those costs contractually required to be paid by the company amounted to million 
management intends to continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its business and  accordingly  may seek to obtain additional funds through equity offerings or debt financing 
the company has a shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission providing for the issuance of up to million in additional equity securities and million in additional debt securities 
during march  the company used a portion of its borrowing capacity under the shelf registration to issue  through the operating partnership  million of senior  unsecured notes  maturing march   with a coupon rate of effective yield of 
the proceeds of this offering were used to extinguish the company s revolving lines of credit existing prior to january in april  the company filed a new registration statement with the sec to reestablish the total amount of funds available under the shelf registration at million 
during the year  the company established a new million secured line of credit  with interest payable at libor plus and established other unsecured lines of credit totalling million with interest rates ranging from prime less 
to prime or libor plus to libor plus 
amounts available under these lines of credit  based on debt outstanding at december   totalled million 
when considered with the company s existing interest rate protection agreement covering million of variable rate debt  the company s exposure to interest rate risk on variable rate borrowings outstanding at december  was limited to million 
also  with the addition of the unsecured borrowings  the company has effectively unencumbered approximately of its real estate assets 
based on existing credit facilities  ongoing negotiations with certain financial institutions and funds available under the shelf registration  management believes that the company has access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during and the company anticipates that adequate cash will be available to fund its operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations  and the payment of dividends in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and long term 
although the operating partnership receives most of its rental payments on a monthly basis  distributions are made quarterly 
amounts accumulated for distribution will be invested in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
certain of the company s debt agreements limit the payment of dividends such that dividends will not exceed of funds from operations ffo  as defined in the agreements  on a cumulative basis 
funds from operations management believes that to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the company  ffo should be considered in conjunction with net income as presented in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the annual report 
management generally considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the performance of an equity real estate investment trust reit 
ffo is generally defined as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  before extraordinary item and gains losses on sale of properties  plus depreciation and amortization and adjustments for other non cash items 
the company cautions that the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity and as such the presentation of ffo by the company may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reporting companies 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of operating performance or to cash from operations as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flows available to fund dividends to shareholders and other cash needs 
in march  the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit issued an interpretive letter providing guidance as to the use and intent of its definition of funds from operations 
among other things  the letter clarifies that the amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of assets not uniquely significant to real estate should be excluded from total depreciation and amortization added back to net income in calculating funds from operations 
all reit s were encouraged to implement the recommendations of the letter no later than fiscal periods beginning in the company adopted the new nareit definition of funds from operations beginning january  and has reclassified the prior year amounts to conform with the current year presentation 
below is a calculation of funds from operations for the years ended december  and funds from operations in thousands income before gain on sale of land  minority interest and extraordinary item   adjusted for depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate   funds from operations before minority interest   weighted average shares outstanding   assumes conversion of all partnership units held by the minority interest and preferred shares to common shares 
economic conditions and outlook substantially all of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales above predetermined levels  which the company believes often are lower than traditional retail industry standards which generally increase as prices rise 
most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and promotion  thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company has an interest rate protection agreement which limits the effect of changes in interest rates on approximately million of its floating rate debt through october this agreement  combined with the existing fixed rate mortgages  mitigate the company s exposure to interest rate risk on approximately of total debt outstanding as of december  approximately  square feet of space is currently up for renewal or re tenanting in existing tenants sales have remained stable and renewals to existing tenants have remained strong 
in addition  the company has continued to attract and retain additional tenants 
however  as typical in the factory outlet industry  certain tenants have either filed for protection under bankruptcy laws or have elected to close some or all of their stores  resulting in approximately a decrease in occupancy since year end 
although there can be no assurance that any tenant whose lease expires will renew such lease or that terminated leases will be re leased on economically favorable terms  management currently does not expect any material adverse impact as a result of these leases up for renewal  bankruptcy filings or notices of store closings 
the company s factory outlet centers typically include well known  national  brand name companies 
by maintaining a broad base of credit tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the united states  the company reduces its operating and leasing risks 
contingencies there are no recorded amounts resulting from environmental liabilities as there are no known material loss contingencies with respect thereto 
future claims for environmental liabilities are not measurable given the uncertainties surrounding whether there exists a basis for any such claims to be asserted and  if so  whether any claims will  in fact  be asserted 
furthermore  no condition is known to exist that would give rise to a material environmental liability for site restoration  post closure and monitoring commitments  or other costs that may be incurred upon the sale or disposal of a property 
management has no plans to abandon any of the properties and is unaware of any other material loss contingencies
