item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook and overview the company s operations and future results have been altered significantly by the acquisitions of mallard and quail in november as a result of the mallard acquisition  the company has become one of the primary barge drilling contractors in the gulf of mexico and nigeria  each of which were markets in which parker previously did not operate 
as a result of the quail acquisition  the company expanded its operations into the rental tool market in the gulf of mexico and the gulf coast region 
the pending acquisition of hercules and the recent acquisition of bolifor are expected to further change the nature of the company s operations and its future results 
in addition to increasing the size and scope of the company s operations  the hercules acquisition will further increase the percentage of the company s revenue generated domestically 
parker generated approximately of its revenue from domestic sources in fiscal the financings related to the mallard and quail acquisitions in november  combined with the company s issuance of the convertible notes in july  have substantially increased the company s debt levels 
at august   the company had million in total indebtedness  compared to million of total indebtedness at august  the substantial levels of debt will result in a higher level of interest expense and an increased percentage of the company s cash flows being used for debt service and may limit the company s ability to obtain additional financing for future acquisitions and capital expenditures

the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of mallard and quail were recorded at their estimated fair values as of november   the date the acquisitions were consummated

the company recorded net income of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal increased land rig utilization and improved margins plus profit generated by the offshore and tool rental segments were partially offset by increased interest and depreciation and amortization expenses

drilling activity in the former soviet union and middle east countries remained nearly the same as in fiscal however  at fiscal year end  the company was mobilizing one land rig to niger for a one rig contract and moving a land rig from russia to kazakhstan to begin a drilling program from a gravel island in the caspian sea 
additionally  the company is modifying one of its barge rigs that previously operated in nigeria  for service in another international location 
land drilling revenues generated a profit margin revenue less direct operating expense of million in fiscal  an increase of million 
increased profit margins resulted from increased rig utilization and higher dayrates as previously discussed 
the offshore drilling and tool rental segments acquired in fiscal generated profit margins of million and million  respectively 
the increased profit margins of million were somewhat offset by million higher depreciation and amortization expense and a million increase in interest expense 
higher depreciation and amortization expense was attributable to a combined million depreciation for mallard and quail and million of goodwill amortization in fiscal increased interest expense resulted from million of debt incurred in november to finance the mallard and quail acquisitions and the issuance of million of convertible notes in july a million increase in interest income was due to higher cash and cash equivalent levels maintained during the year

results of operations as compared to continued although worldwide contract drilling revenue decreased million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  the total drilling margin drilling revenue less drilling expense increased million over the same period

other matters internationally  the company specializes in drilling in remote locations and under difficult geological or operating conditions 
the company s international services are primarily utilized by international and national oil companies in the exploration and development of reserves of oil 
domestically  the company specializes in drilling deep wells in search of natural gas 
business activity is dependent on the exploration and development activities of the major  independent and national oil and gas companies that make up the company s customer base 
generally  temporary fluctuations in oil and gas prices do not materially affect these companies exploration and development activities  and consequently do not materially affect the operations of the company 
however  sustained increases or decreases in oil and natural gas prices could have an impact on customers long term exploration and development activities which in turn could materially affect the company s operations 
generally  a sustained change in the price of oil would have a greater impact on the company s international operations while a sustained change in the price of natural gas would have a greater effect on domestic operations 
although recent price increases for natural gas have spurred domestic drilling activity  weak prices have resulted in depressed markets for domestic drilling services over the past decade 
historically  due to the importance of oil revenue to most of the countries in which the company operates  the company s operations generally have not been negatively impacted by adverse economic and political conditions 
however  there can be no assurances that such conditions could not have a material adverse effect in the future 
in fiscal year the company purchased a software package which is year compliant 
during fiscal year the company installed significant financial applications and intends to install remaining applications in the near future

the statement will be effective for the company s fiscal quarter which will end february  early application of this statement is not permitted 
the company anticipates that the effect of this pronouncement will be minimal
