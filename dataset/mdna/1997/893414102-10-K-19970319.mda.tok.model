item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview the company was incorporated in august to build and operate a communications network focused on the network services needs of the pos point of sale point of service transaction processing industry 
between august and may  the company was primarily engaged in raising capital from investors and in the initial development of its network 
in june the company transmitted its first pos transaction  and since then has increased its average daily transaction volume from approximately  in the third quarter of to more than million in the fourth quarter of in june  the company acquired fortune telecommunications  inc fti of ft 
lauderdale  florida  which provided customers in the telecommunications industry with telephone call fraud control and billing validation services 
the company is organized around its three key service divisions pos services include the company s transxpress r network services for the pos transaction processing industry 
telecom services includes fti s card tel r telephone call billing validation and fraud control services and other services targeting primarily the telecommunications industry 
tns strengthened its position in the telephone call billing validation and fraud control market through the purchase of assets primarily contract rights  marketing and services agreements  non compete agreements and computer software and databases from intellicall  inc intellicall in june of and from amnex  inc in march of international activities in  the company began to recognize revenue from a third area  the sale of products and services in international markets 
in ireland  the company has formed a majority owned subsidiary which intends to provide pos network services in ireland in the future 
the company continues to actively market its products and services to potential international customers 
in march  the company announced a new product line tns fastlink r data services 
this new line of services is currently being deployed and will offer a secure private network for transmitting securities trading orders electronically between brokerage firms and financial institutions 
tns fastlink r services revenues will consist of a one time installation fee and fixed monthly recurring revenues thereafter based on the number of connections 
this fastlink r service offering will require the company to build and support a tcp ip backbone network as well as acquire a significant amount of dedicated hardware 
current equipment facilities are sufficient to house the additional hardware requirements 
the company does not expect to generate significant revenues from this new service during the company achieved revenue per employee of more than  in and in excess of  in forward looking statements statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report that are not descriptions of historical fact may be forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors  including the company s reliance on a limited number of major customers  dependence on market expansion  competition  technological change and necessity of developing new services  dependence on proprietary rights  changes in government regulation including the telecommunications act of and seasonality and fluctuations in quarterly results  which are further discussed in this annual report 
see item business customers  tns strategy  competition  proprietary rights  government regulation  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
pos services overview the company s pos services revenues are derived primarily from the transmission through its network of transaction information between merchant or service provider pos terminals and transaction processing computer centers 
the company s pos services customers  primarily third party transaction processors  are typically charged a set price per transaction and an additional excess seconds charge for transactions which utilize the company s network facilities for a period of time greater than that which is specified in the customers contract 
in addition to revenues derived directly from transaction volume  pos services revenue includes certain other revenues composed primarily of fixed monthly fees charged to customers for the use of digital transmission circuits which connect their processing facilities to the company s network 
the vast majority of pos services revenue is derived from customers involved in the electronic processing of point of sale credit card transactions 
to a much lesser extent  the company derives pos service revenue from the electronic processing of other types of pos transactions such as healthcare insurance eligibility verification  electronic transfer of government benefits such as food stamps and aid to families with dependent children electronic benefits transfer or ebt  point of sale transactions using debit cards and other smaller pos markets 
the company s transaction volume and revenue growth to date has resulted primarily from increasing the company s transaction volumes from existing customers and from attracting new customers to the tns network 
the majority of the company s revenue growth has resulted from increasing its market share 
to a lesser extent  the company has benefited from the growth in electronic transaction processing markets 
this growth has resulted primarily from an increase in the number of credit card transactions processed electronically 
the company believes that in the future the use of electronic transaction processing in markets other than the credit card market  including transactions for the healthcare industry and ebt transactions  will also contribute to overall market growth 
during  five of the eight largest third party pos credit card transaction processors were customers of the company 
these five customers comprised approximately of the company s pos services revenue and of its total revenue 
due to certain of the company s contractual commitments and certain third party processors relationships with their network affiliates  the company does not believe that the remaining three of the current eight largest pos credit card transaction processors are currently prospects for the company s services 
consequently  while the company will continue to pursue certain of the remaining large third party processors as well as smaller processors  it expects that the predominant source of growth within pos services will come from increasing its transaction volume from existing credit card processing customers and growth from new pos transaction markets 
as a result  the company does not expect that its pos services revenue growth rate will continue at historical levels 
average revenue per pos transaction decreased to in from in and from in for several reasons 
a number of the company s largest customers reached predetermined levels of transaction volumes per month  qualifying these customers for volume discounts in accordance with their contracts 
also  during  the company re negotiated contracts with most of its largest customers 
several of these contracts called for a single flat rate basic price structure with increasing volume commitments during the life of the contract  rather than volume discounts which become effective only after certain volume thresholds are met 
the pricing of these new contracts was significantly lower than the pricing these customers received prior to these re negotiations 
as a result of this new pricing structure  combined with lower pricing for certain customers with traditional volume discount contracts  average revenue per transaction declined by in from  significantly greater than the approximately to average experienced in prior periods 
the majority of these customers benefited from the re negotiated contracts during  however  the remaining contracts take effect january  the full effect of the contract re negotiations will be reflected in the average revenue per pos transaction during the first quarter of future average revenue per pos transaction will also depend on the relative contribution to total transaction volume of each of the company s sources of pos transactions 
increasing competition from other network services providers could also contribute to future declining prices per transaction 
telecom services overview tns s june acquisition of fti added a second significant service offering telecom services to the company s business 
tns s telecommunications services revenue is currently derived primarily from its activities in providing fraud control and billing validation services to telecommunications carriers which allow telephone users to bill charges to an alternate billing source such as a calling card  collect or third party account 
revenues from these activities are derived primarily from a per query fee charged to the company s customers for each processed fraud control and billing validation query 
in addition to revenues derived directly from the volume of queries  telecommunications services revenue includes certain other revenues composed primarily of fixed monthly fees charged to customers for the use of transmission circuits  network equipment or access ports on the company s computer and communications facilities 
customers for the company s current telecommunications services include long distance telephone carriers  operator services providers  information services providers and private pay telephone companies 
management believes it has substantially penetrated the current available transaction volume from existing customers and revenue growth will be dependent on adding new customers and new services as well as on potential market growth 
in june  the company acquired from intellicall the right to provide fraud control and billing validation services to over private pay telephone companies 
in march  the company completed an asset purchase from amnex  inc amnex of amnex s proprietary fraud control system and related databases 
the transaction also provided for a ten year exclusive service agreement and a joint marketing agreement to cross sell each other s services 
certain of the company s telecommunications services customers have long term contracts while others have extended beyond their contract term or do not have long term contracts 
many of the company s telecommunications services customers are small and have limited resources 
as a result  revenues from these customers are subject to a higher degree of credit risk than is the case for the company s pos services customers 
management believes the company is adequately reserved for the credit risk associated with this customer base 
since its inception in  the company s telecom services division has grown principally through the addition of new customers  through the acquisition of contract rights and other intangible assets  and through the provision of new service offerings 
the company s core customers in the fraud control and billing validation services market have not achieved growth rates comparable with those experienced by many of the company s pos customers  and in some cases have experienced some erosion in call and query volumes and revenues 
the market for third party billing validation and fraud control services has also been adversely impacted by so called dial around and pre paid calling card services which use wats services to route telephone calls made from pay phones  hotel phones  or other public use telephones to long distance carriers other than those chosen by the telephone proprietor 
these dial around offerings effectively divert telephone calls away from the company s traditional customer base for fraud control and billing validation services primarily operator services providers and pay telephone providers to other telecommunications companies with separate billing validation databases in many cases mci and at t 
as part of the act  the fcc was authorized to mandate a payment scheme pursuant to which pay telephone operators are fairly compensated for all access code calls  debit card calls  subscriber and other toll free calls which originate on the pay phone service providers facilities but which are routed to telecommunications carriers other than those pre subscribed by the pay phone operators dial around compensation 
in october  an interim solution for dial around compensation was announced by the fcc 
under the new regulations  pay telephone operators are to receive an increased fixed monthly fee of per pay telephone from the long distance voice carriers which use these pay telephone facilities 
while it is uncertain what impact the new rules will have on dial around usage and therefore on demand for traditional tns s telecom services offerings  many industry observers believe that the use of dial around services will continue to grow at the expense of the traditional pay telephone long distance services upon which the company s core customer base for fraud control and billing validation services relies 
recently  several local exchange carriers lecs have furthered this trend by introducing proprietary calling cards which utilize dial around access 
management believes that the success of dial around services to date is related to both the method of compensation chosen for the interim solution  which does not directly tie the cost of dial around compensation to the usage of dial around services  and also to other market forces favoring the growth of these type of services 
while there can be no assurance of the company s success in new marketing efforts  the company is currently pursuing several business opportunities from which it could take advantage of the continuing trend toward the use of dial around services by providing fraud control and or billing validation services to several potential vendors of dial around services 
international services overview the company currently has international activities primarily in the united kingdom uk  canada and ireland and recognized  of international revenue in in the uk and canada  the company has entered into technology transfer arrangements whereby tns provides pos equipment and software to its international customers through one time sales  but also has agreements entitling it to receive recurring revenues in the form of software license fees  maintenance fees and royalties 
these fees are based on the pos revenues generated by its international customers resulting through the use of the company s pos technology 
management currently expects to begin to record royalty revenue under these arrangements in in ireland  the company has formed a majority owned subsidiary  transaction network services limited tnsl which intends to provide pos network services in ireland in the future 
tnsl is in a start up phase and has not generated revenue to date 
tnsl losses of approximately  were absorbed and not capitalized by the company 
network cost overview the majority of the company s operating expenses relate to the costs of its communications network 
the largest component of expense  cost of network services  is composed of five elements usage costs charged by local exchange carriers for local access to the tns network and by inter exchange carriers for their service  per transaction costs charged to the company by local exchange carriers and others for access to information from line information databases lidbs  recurring costs for salaries and expenses related to the personnel responsible for managing  operating and servicing the network and computer facilities  recurring monthly charges for digital transmission circuits for network access and backbone capacity connecting the company s sites  site co location fees or site leases and other network expenses  and recurring charges related to the company s computer facilities  and network expansion charges which include charges related to the activation of new customer numbers across the network and installation charges for incremental digital transmission capacity  new sites and other elements of network expansion 
network expansion charges are expensed by the company at the time such costs are incurred 
pursuant to the telecommunications act of the act  the fcc is currently considering the reform of the current system of interstate access charges  and the commission has indicated that it intends to issue final rules in connection with access charge reform during under certain access charge reform proposals  tns would be placed at the risk of substantial rate increases that would allow incumbent lecs to include a call setup charge in their local switching rate structures or to permit incumbent lecs to charge nothing for terminating access service and instead recover the costs of providing such services by increasing their originating access charges 
conversely  tns would benefit greatly from any proposal that would have the net result of lowering its overall network access costs 
the final impact of access charge reform on the company s future network access costs is unknown  and the company cannot predict the timing  outcome or effects of the fcc s deliberations or of any future tariff matters 
the company expanded its backbone and access network capacity significantly during and in order to ensure adequate capacity and an appropriate network architecture for expected increases in network traffic from current and new markets 
in  a significant portion of the expansion cost was incurred in connection with the first data corporation fdc contract renewal which called for a significant increase in transaction volume 
in  the company will continue to monitor and expand its backbone and access network capacity as required to handle traffic growth from existing customers 
during  the company will incur significant non recurring network expansion costs as well as a significant increase in certain recurring costs 
a significant portion of these costs are associated with the increase in transaction volume from existing pos and telecom customers and the implementation of fastlink r data services tcp ip backbone network 
costs also include the implementation of the company s service and establishment of several network equipment sites 
the service implementation and establishment of its own site facilities will reduce the variable cost of providing access service and provide greater control and flexibility with its digital backbone network while reducing reliance upon third party service providers 
depending on the demand for some of the pos and telecommunications services expected to be offered by the company during  significant additional incremental expansion of network costs may be required 
results of operations the following table sets forth the applicable percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 
year ended december  revenues cost of network services gross profit other operating expenses engineering development selling  general administrative depreciation amortization of intangibles total other operating expenses income from operations interest income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income includes the results of fti from june   the closing date of its acquisition by the company  through december  see note of notes to financial statements

compared to revenues total revenues increased by to  from  in pos services revenue contributed of the growth which was due to the increased usage of the tns network by the company s pos services customers 
telecommunications service customers contributed of the growth and the remaining resulted primarily from development fees and equipment sales derived from the company s international activities 
as of january  the company began reporting a single line item of revenue which includes pos services revenue  telecom services revenue and international revenue 
pos services revenue increased by to  from  in the growth in pos services revenue resulted primarily from an increase in transaction volume and associated revenue from the company s existing pos customers 
pos transaction volume increased by to  million from  million transactions in substantially all of the revenues that were derived from pos services were generated by existing customers and accordingly  most of the increase in pos services resulted from growth in transaction volume from existing customers 
the company s five largest pos customers represented of total pos revenues in and in the company does not expect that its revenue growth rate will continue at historical levels 
the transaction volume growth rate exceeded the revenue growth rate primarily because the average revenue per transaction declined by approximately during this decline in average revenue per transaction occurred as a result of several factors 
first data corporation fdc  the company s largest customer  entered into a new five year service contract with tns which resulted in a significant price reduction for fdc effective january  under the terms of the contract  fdc has agreed to a minimum revenue commitment to tns of million over the term of the contract  which extends to december  several of the company s other largest customers also entered into new long term contracts with the company which resulted in significant price reductions for those customers 
including fdc  three of the company s five largest customers benefited from new long term contracts which incorporated immediate price reductions 
in july  the company entered into a new contract with one of its customers which resulted in lower pricing in exchange for a significant transaction commitment extending to the year subsequent to the execution of the new contract  this customer acquired one of the company s five largest customers and included that customer s transaction volume under the new contract 
the effect of this acquisition on average revenue per transaction was fully reflected in the fourth quarter of as the new pricing was in place for the entire quarter 
average revenue per transaction also declined as a result of price discounts based on increasing transaction volumes for many customers and from the relative contribution to total transaction volume of certain of the company s customers 
price reductions set forth in certain other contracts took effect on january  telecommunications revenue increased by to  from  during this revenue was generated primarily by fees charged on a per query basis to telecommunications customers for the company s telephone call fraud control and billing validation services 
the growth in revenue came from growth in queries processed for the company s telecommunications customers  from the inclusion of the revenues derived from the june  intellicall asset purchase and  to a much lesser extent  from the purchase of intangible assets including an exclusive services agreement from amnex  inc in march these contract rights generated approximately million in revenue in international revenue  a new source of revenue for tns in  was  for the company has entered into technology transfer agreements whereby the company provides pos equipment and software to its international customers 
to date  international revenue has primarily consisted of equipment and software sales 
future revenues will consist of recurring revenue in the form of software license fees  maintenance fees and royalties 
in ireland  the company has formed a majority owned subsidiary  tnsl  which intends to provide pos network services in ireland in the future 
tnsl is in a start up phase and has not generated revenue to date 
tnsl losses of approximately  were absorbed and not capitalized by the company 
cost of network services cost of network services increased by to  from  during this growth resulted primarily from increases in local access  usage charges and charges for billing validation information resulting from increased transaction and query volume 
growth in cost of network services also resulted from costs associated with increases in network capacity purchased from outside vendors and from increases in other costs associated with operating the company s network 
lastly  the growth of cost of network services was also increased by the cost of goods sold related to equipment sales 
the reduction in average revenue per transaction for pos network services was significantly  but not fully  offset by several factors 
the company was able to continue to achieve economies of scale on its network as the growth in transaction and query volume and associated revenue was larger than the increase in recurring costs for network capacity and network management 
in addition  the company has consistently been able to negotiate better rates from its large vendors of network capacity and services as it has increased its consumption of these services 
in august  a reduction in the cost per minute of usage for local access charged by lecs went into effect by fcc mandate  effectively reducing the company s variable cost per transaction 
in july  most of the major lecs modestly reduced the cost per minute rate charged to the company for local access 
however  several of the carriers substantially increased certain rate elements which had the effect of raising the effective per minute rate for these carriers  more than offsetting the benefit of cost reductions from the other carriers 
pursuant to the telecommunications act of the act  the fcc is currently considering the reform of the current system of interstate access charges  and the fcc has indicated that it intends to issue final rules in connection with access charge reform during the final impact of access charge reform on the company s future network access costs is unknown but could have a material effect on the company s current access cost structure 
gross profit gross profit increased by to  from  during this represented and of total revenues for and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of total revenues reflects the fact that the reduction in average revenue per pos transaction over the periods was largely  but not completely  offset by network efficiencies and local access rate reductions 
as a result of the expected decline in average revenue per transaction  resulting from normal volume price discounts combined with the fdc contract renewal  the company did not maintain the levels of gross profit margin experienced in and under the new fdc contract  which took effect january   overall average revenue per transaction declined significantly more than has been the case in recent years and both one time costs for network expansion and recurring network operating costs increased substantially 
the gross margin on equipment sales was not significantly different than the gross margin on network services during the year 
the reduction in gross profit as a percentage of total revenue is expected to continue in as a result of contract negotiations in that took effect on january  while there can be no assurance  management believes  based on current trends and conditions with its customers and vendors  that the company will eventually return to its historical pattern of price reductions being offset by increased network efficiencies from transaction volume increases and unit cost reductions for key network costs 
however  in  the incremental increase in transaction volume and revenue is not anticipated to offset significant price reductions and network cost increases  and a further reduction in gross profit margin is likely 
the company is continuously engaged in the review and dispute of improperly billed charges from its largest vendors  the lecs 
the amount of billing disputes resolved in the company s favor during was larger than had been experienced in prior periods 
pursuant to the telecommunications act of the act  the fcc is currently considering the reform of the current system of interstate access charges  and the fcc has indicated that it intends to issue final rules in connection with access charge reform during the final impact of access charge reform on the company s future network access costs is unknown but could have a material effect on the company s gross profit margin 
the eventual level of the gross profit margin will depend upon a number of factors including total transaction and query volume growth  the relative growth and contribution to total transaction volume of each of the company s customers  the timing and extent of the company s network expansion and the timing and extent of any network cost reductions of which the company may be able to take advantage 
in addition  any significant loss or significant reduction in the growth of transaction volume could lead to a decline in gross margin because a significant portion of network costs are fixed costs  and maintaining the historical gross margin level depends in part on growth in transaction volume generating economies of scale 
engineering and development engineering and development expense increased by to  from  during engineering and development expense is composed of the salaries  personnel expenses and other expenses related to the company s network equipment systems integration  software development and technology assessment activities 
these expenses are incurred primarily to develop and enhance network software and systems  to develop specialized software and equipment for new customers  to conduct research and develop new service offerings  and to build  test  maintain and modify existing network software and systems 
engineering and development expenses also increased as a result of the formation of tnsl in july tnsl is currently in a start up phase and intends to provide pos network services in ireland 
failure to successfully implement the ireland pos services in a timely manner may result in increased engineering and development costs as a percentage of total revenue 
the company has not capitalized any costs associated with software or other development performed by its engineering and development groups 
future engineering and development cost may increase due to additional resource requirements associated with the introduction of new product services 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to  from  during selling  general and administrative expenses include sales  marketing  finance  accounting and administrative costs 
the increase in these expenses is attributable to several factors 
additional expenses were incurred as a result of an increase in administrative staff and expenses associated with the growth of the company 
an increase in sales costs resulting primarily from an increase in sales staff and salary expense also contributed to the growth in selling  general and administrative expenses 
on june   tns entered into a billing agreement with intellicall 
for a  prepayment  intellicall provides billing services to tns for telecommunications services provided by tns to customers whose contract rights were acquired from intellicall by tns 
during the third quarter of  tns began recognizing the billing services expenses associated with the intellicall agreement and expects that it will have fully utilized the prepayment for these services during the next three to five years  depending on the volume of telecommunications services billed through this agreement 
in march  the company relocated to a new headquarters facility and began incurring lease expense on the new building at that time 
increased lease costs and other expenses related to the relocation also contributed to the growth in selling  general and administrative expenses 
total lease costs and building expenses related to the new headquarters facility were approximately  for the full year of compared to approximately  in selling  general and administrative expenses also increased as a result of the formation of tnsl 
failure to successfully implement the ireland pos services in a timely manner may result in increased selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenue 
depreciation depreciation expense increased by to  from  during depreciation expense increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of capital equipment for network expansion to support growth in the company s business 
capital expenditures for network and office equipment amounted to  for depreciation expense relating to network and office equipment is recorded using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years 
amortization of intangibles the amortization of intangible assets increased by to  from  during the increase resulted primarily from two factors 
first  the amortization of certain intangible assets acquired from intellicall for approximately  on june  was recognized for the entire period of versus six months of second  on march   the company completed an asset purchase from amnex of amnex s proprietary fraud control system and related databases and entered into long term marketing and service agreements with amnex 
the company paid approximately  in cash for these intangible assets resulting in increased amortization 
amortization of all existing intangible assets is expected to be approximately  per quarter over the next several years 
income taxes provision for income taxes was  for the period ended december  compared to  for the period ending december   the effective tax rate in the year ending december  was approximately 
in  the effective tax rate has increased to approximately as a result of the company s activities in ireland 
continued losses experienced by tnsl may continue to increase the company s future effective tax rate 
the company has not recorded a tax asset for these losses due to tnsl s brief operating history 
if tnsl becomes profitable  tnsl may cause a reduction in the effective tax rate due to a lower effective tax rate in ireland than in the united states

telecommunications services revenue grew by to  in from  for the period from june  through december  this growth was primarily a result of recognizing a full year of telecom services revenue in versus approximately seven months in  from growth in query volume resulting from the addition of new telecom services customers  and from growth in transaction volume resulting from the addition of new pay phone customers associated with the purchase of certain contract rights from intellicall in june telecom services revenue was generated primarily by fees charged on a per query basis to the company s customers for its telephone call fraud control and billing validation services 
certain revenue was related to fixed fees charged to customers primarily for network connection and port availability on the company s computer and communication facilities 
on june   tns paid  for certain contract rights and certain marketing  service and non compete agreements with intellicall 
as a result  tns derives pos services revenue from providing transxpress r network services and telecom services revenue from providing card tel r telephone call fraud control and billing validation services for transactions generated by pay telephone calls for certain customers operating intellicall s pay telephone equipment 
tns transmits over its network the short data messages queries containing telephone call billing information from these pay telephones to the company s telecommunications services data processing system where it provides fraud control and billing validation services 
these contract rights generated approximately million in revenue in cost of network services cost of network services increased by to  in from  in this growth resulted primarily from increases in local access and usage charges resulting from increased transaction volume  from costs associated with increases in network capacity purchased from outside vendors and from the inclusion of the cost of network services for telecommunications services 
cost of network services for telecommunications services consists primarily of costs for access to lidbs and of costs related to the maintenance and control of the division s communications and data processing computer systems 
cost of network services remained relatively constant as a percentage of revenue at in and in  despite declining prices for pos transactions averaging to per annum and a similar decrease in the average revenue per query for telecom services in  resulting from several factors 
in august  a reduction in the cost per minute of usage for pos transactions charged by local exchange carriers went into effect by fcc mandate  resulting in a lower than expected increase in overall cost of network services

as a result of these seasonal patterns  revenues  earnings and profit margins from pos credit card transactions in the first quarter  when revenues are lower and network utilization is lower  are expected to be significantly lower relative to the fourth quarter of the immediately preceding year  when revenues and network utilization are high 
to date  the strong underlying growth of the company s pos business has alleviated this seasonal effect to some extent  but the company expects that its operating results in the foreseeable future will be significantly affected by seasonal trends 
the company s revenues from calling card transactions tend to be greatest during the second and third quarters  although this revenue composes a smaller percentage of total revenues than does pos services revenue 
variability also occurs in operating expenses due to the timing of network expansion and price discounts 
the company will incur significant non recurring network expansion costs as well as a significant increase in certain recurring network costs during a significant portion of these costs are associated with the increase transaction volume from existing pos and telecom customers and from the implementation of fastlink r services 
costs also include the implementation of the company s service and build out of several network equipment sites which will provide the company less reliance on service and network access providers 
the company may experience a reduction in gross margin in certain quarters depending on the timing of these costs 
as a result of all these factors  significant variability in quarterly earnings is expected
