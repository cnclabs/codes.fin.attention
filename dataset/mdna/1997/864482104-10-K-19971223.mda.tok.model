item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of the historical and pro forma financial condition and results of operations of the predecessor company and the partnership 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the historical and pro forma consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
since the operating partnership and service company account for substantially all of the assets  revenues and earnings of the partnership  a separate discussion of the partnership s results of operations from other sources is not presented 
general the partnership is engaged in the retail and wholesale marketing of propane and related appliances and services 
the partnership believes it is the third largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  serving more than  active residential  commercial  industrial and agricultural customers from more than customer service centers in over states 
the partnership s annual retail propane sales volume were approximately million  million and million gallons during the fiscal years ended september   september  and september   respectively 
the retail propane business of the partnership consists principally of transporting propane purchased on the contract and spot markets  primarily from major oil companies  to its retail distribution outlets and then to storage tanks located on the customers premises 
in the residential and commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating  clothes drying and cooking purposes 
industrial customers primarily use propane as a motor fuel burned in internal combustion engines that power over the road vehicles  forklifts and stationary engines  to fire furnaces  as a cutting gas and in other process applications 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for tobacco curing  crop drying  poultry brooding and weed control 
in its wholesale operations  the partnership sells propane principally to large industrial end users and other propane distributors 
the retail propane distribution business is seasonal because of propane s primary use for heating in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of the partnership s retail propane volume is sold during the six month peak heating season of october through march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in the partnership s first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flows from operations  therefore  are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the winter heating season 
to the extent necessary  the partnership will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to unitholders in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
the retail propane business is a margin based business where the level of profitability is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales prices and product cost 
the unit cost of propane is subject to volatile changes as a result of product supply or other market conditions 
propane unit cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact retail margins 
there is no assurance that the partnership will be able to pass on product cost increases fully  particularly when product costs increase rapidly 
selected quarterly historical and pro forma financial data in thousands the following historical pro forma quarterly financial data for periods prior to the partnership formation were derived from the historical statements of operations of the predecessor company for the period october  through march  and reflect the effects of the partnership formation as if the formation had been completed in its entirety as of the beginning of the periods presented 
the pro forma quarterly financial data do not purport to present the results of operations of the partnership had the partnership formation actually been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented 
in addition  the pro forma quarterly financial data are not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations of the partnership and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this form k

revenues increased million or to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the overall increase is primarily attributable to higher average retail and wholesale selling prices resulting from higher propane product costs 
retail gallons sold decreased or million gallons to million gallons in fiscal as compared to million gallons in the prior year  while wholesale gallons sold decreased or million gallons to million gallons compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in gallons sold is primarily due to warmer temperatures during the winter heating season in all areas of the partnership s operations 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million or to million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit principally resulted from higher average retail propane unit margins partially offset by reduced volumes of propane sold 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million or to million for fiscal year as compared to million in the prior year 
operating expenses increased due to higher payroll  bad debt and equipment and vehicle leasing costs 
restructuring charge 
fiscal results reflect a restructuring charge of million compared to a million restructuring charge incurred in fiscal in fiscal  after evaluating certain long term cost reduction strategies and organizational changes  the partnership reorganized its product procurement and logistics group  redesigned its fleet and maintenance  field and corporate office organizations  and identified facilities to be closed and impaired assets whose carrying amounts would not be recovered 
in connection with this effort  the partnership recorded a million restructuring charge  comprised of severance  employee benefit and facility closure costs of million and an impaired asset charge of million 
in fiscal  the partnership reorganized its corporate office and terminated certain employees 
as a result of this action  the partnership recorded a million restructuring charge  comprised of severance and employee benefit costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  including the management fee charged to the predecessor company and excluding restructuring charges  increased million or to million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
expenses increased principally due to higher expenditures for professional consulting services primarily information systems and expansion of customer satisfaction programs 
operating income and ebitda 
operating income  excluding the restructuring charges  decreased million or to million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
ebitda  decreased or to million 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the higher operating  selling  general and administrative expenses and the fiscal restructuring charge partially offset by higher overall retail margins 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as in indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to pay the minimum quarterly distribution 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues increased million or to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the overall increase is primarily attributable to higher retail volumes and wholesale volumes coupled with increased retail and wholesale selling prices 
retail gallons sold increased or million gallons to million gallons as compared to million gallons in fiscal  while wholesale gallons sold increased or million gallons to million gallons compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in gallons sold is due to the colder temperatures in all sections of the country  except for the west region

ebitda increased million or to million 
the increase is primarily attributable to the higher volume of retail gallons sold partially offset by lower retail margins and an increase in operating and general and administrative expenses 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as in indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to pay the minimum quarterly distribution 
liquidity and capital resources the partnership believes that approximately million of maintenance capital expenditures will be required in fiscal year for repair and replacement of property  plant and equipment 
the partnership expects to fund these capital expenditures from cash flow from operations or from borrowings under the working capital facility 
due to the seasonal nature of the propane business  cash flows from operating activities are greater during the winter and spring seasons as customers pay for propane purchased during the heating season 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million compared to million in fiscal cash provided by operating activities during fiscal  reflects increases in cash from accounts receivable of million  prepaid and other current assets of million and inventories of million principally due to lower sales volumes and a resulting decline in propane purchases 
these increases were offset by an aggregate decrease in accounts payable  accrued interest and accrued employment and benefit costs of million and million of cash expenditures incurred in connection with the partnership s restructuring 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  reflecting million in capital expenditures and million of payments for acquisitions  offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  consisting of capital expenditures of million and acquisition payments of million  offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million 
the decrease in cash used for acquisition activities of million primarily results from the partnership s fiscal emphasis on internal growth through improved customer retention and marketing as compared to growth from acquisitions 
the partnership believes that internal growth  given the high values being paid to acquire propane distributors  is currently the more economical method of expanding its business 
the partnership will  however  continue to pursue selective accretive acquisitions during fiscal for fiscal year  net cash provided by operating activities increased million or to million compared to million for fiscal year the increase is primarily attributable to an aggregate increase in accounts payable  accrued interest and expenses and other noncurrent liabilities totaling million partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and decreased net income totaling million arising from an increase in the cost and volume of gallons sold and operating under the partnership structure for seven months of fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal year  reflecting million in capital expenditures and million of payments for the acquisition of new customer service centers offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of marginal performing customer service center locations and other property and equipment 
prior to march   the predecessor company s cash accounts had been managed on a centralized basis by hm holdings  inc hm holdings  a wholly owned affiliate of hanson 
accordingly  cash receipts and disbursements relating to the operations of suburban propane were received or funded by hm holdings 
net cash provided by financing activities  which are reflected as an increase in predecessor equity  was million during the five months ended march  compared to million of cash used by reduction of predecessor equity during the year ended september  in march  the operating partnership issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with an interest rate of for net cash proceeds of million 
also  the partnership  by means of an initial public offering and the exercise of an overallotment option by the underwriters  issued  common units for net cash proceeds of million 
the net proceeds of the notes and common units issuance which totaled million  less a million closing price adjustment paid by quantum in connection with the transactions and million reflecting the retention of net accounts receivable by quantum  were used to acquire the propane assets from quantum  pay off the intercompany payables and make a special distribution to the general partner 
in an effort to reduce annual fees associated with unutilized credit facilities  effective september   the operating partnership amended its bank credit facilities to reduce its acquisition facility to million from million and retain its million working capital facility 
borrowings under the amended agreement will bear interest at a rate based upon either libor plus a margin  first union national bank s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus of 
an annual fee ranging from 
to 
based upon certain financial tests will be payable quarterly whether or not borrowings occur 
the facilities  which expire on september   are unsecured on an equal and ratable basis with the operating partnership s obligations under the senior notes 
at september   there were no amounts outstanding under the bank credit facilities 
as a result of lower than anticipated earnings for fiscal and the costs associated with the restructuring efforts  the partnership utilized million of cash proceeds available under the distribution support agreement between the partnership and the general partner in connection with the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units with respect to the third fiscal quarter of in addition  the partnership received an additional million of cash proceeds under the distribution support agreement in november to support the minimum quarterly distribution in respect to the fourth fiscal quarter of the partnership does not anticipate utilizing proceeds available under the distribution support agreement with respect to the funding of the minimum quarterly distribution for the first quarter of fiscal the distribution support agreement provides for a maximum of approximately million in cash in return for apus million of which has been utilized to support the partnership s minimum quarterly distributions to holders of common units through march  the partnership has not made a distribution on its subordinated units since the first fiscal quarter of and does not intend to make a distribution to the subordinated unitholder for the first fiscal quarter of the partnership will make distributions in an amount equal to all of its available cash approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter to holders of record on the applicable record dates
