results of operations during fiscal years    and  the company reported net income of     and  respectively 
operating results are subject to fluctuations resulting from several factors  including seasonality of lease originations  variations in the relative percentages of the company s leases entered into during the period which are classified as dfls or ols  or are sold for fee income as well as the level of fee income obtained from the sale of leases in excess of lease equipment cost 
the company will adjust the mix of ols and dfls and volume of leases sold to private investors from time to time  when and as the company determines that it would be in its best interests  taking into account profit opportunities  portfolio concentration and residual risk 
in the ordinary course of business  the company will continue to sell new lease originations to its pifs to the extent the pifs have funds available for such purpose or private investors and sell seasoned lease transactions previously originated leases held in the company s portfolio to private investors 
presented below is a schedule showing new lease originations volume and the placement of new lease originations by fiscal year in thousands 
year ended may  placement equipment under lease sold to pifs    equipment under lease sold to private investors    leases added to the company s lease portfolio a significant portion of which will be were sold during the subsequent fiscal years    total lease origination volume    leasing is an alternative to financing equipment with debt 
therefore  the ultimate profitability of the company s leasing transactions is dependent  in part  on the general level of interest rates 
lease rates tend to rise and fall with interest rates  although lease rate movements generally lag interest rate movements 
because the company finances its lease transactions with recourse and non recourse debt  the ultimate profitability of leasing transactions is dependent  in part  on the difference between the interest rate inherent in the lease and the underlying debt rate rate spread 
certain of the company s competitors have access to lower cost funds than the company 
however  the company has developed relationships with various private investors and formed various strategic alliances with investors that have a lower cost of capital enabling the company to originate and sell leases at competitive prices 
as a result of the present relatively low interest rate environment and resulting relatively low lease rates  the company sells the majority of leases it originates to private investors having a lower cost of capital than the company 
of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued i 
results of operations  continued the company is able to originate a certain amount of leases with higher lease rates 
such leases are generally sold to the pif s because  as pif sponsor  the company has a fiduciary responsibility to maximize investor returns and does so by blending higher yielding transactions with investment grade credit quality leases having lower lease rates 
however  given the present market environment  the number of higher yielding transactions having adequate credit quality is limited  and consequently  the volume of leases sold to the pif s is limited 
the company s response to these factors has been to limit the amount of funds it raises from pif investors 
consequently  future equipment sales to pif s are expected to comprise a smaller percentage of total placements of new lease originations than in the past 
the company continues to evaluate additional sources of capital from sources such as securitization or a private debt placement which will provide the liquidity necessary to significantly add leases to its own portfolio 
the goal of such financing will be to lower the company s cost of capital and expand the availability of capital 
the company believes this will enable it to originate leases for its own portfolio which have competitive market lease rates and good credit quality 
the company believes that in the present market there are significant opportunities to originate leases having these characteristics 
however  the company s present capital structure ie  both cost of capital and amount available precludes taking full advantage of market opportunities for such leases 
should the company be successful in identifying and closing on new financing meeting these criteria for which no assurance can be given  it intends to grow its own lease portfolio

results of operations  continued equipment sales  continued equipment sales to pifs equipment sales to the pifs decreased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year and are expected to decrease further in fiscal year because during three of the pifs entered the planned liquidation stage 
once a pif enters the liquidation stage  it no longer acquires equipment under lease 
presently  two pifs are actively acquiring leases compared to four pifs which were actively acquiring leases in equipment sales to pifs increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year principally because more leases were identified and closed as a result of the increased productivity of the field lease originations team see further discussion below 
equipment sales to private investors equipment sales to private investors increased principally because more leases were identified and closed as a result of increased productivity of the field lease originations team 
the increased volume of the field lease originators is primarily due to the company s efforts to improve its marketing activities  including focusing on customer relationships and vertical integration ie  the development of specialized equipment and remarketing expertise and due to establishment of a strategic alliance with an investor having a lower cost of capital enabling the company to originate and sell leases at competitive prices 
equipment sales to private investors margin as a percentage of equipment sales revenue decreased primarily because leases sold to private investors during fiscal year were generally held for a longer period of time pending sale than in prior years 
for the period of time a lease is held pending sale  the company records leasing revenue 
remarketing of the portfolio and related provision for losses the company has been successful in realizing gains on the remarketing of its equipment after the initial lease term for the past twenty consecutive quarters 
the remarketing of equipment for an amount greater than its book value is reported as equipment sales margin if the equipment is sold or as leasing margin if the equipment is re leased 
the realization of less than the carrying value of equipment which is typically not known until remarketing after the expiration of the initial lease term is recorded as provision for losses 
as shown in the tables above  the realizations from sales exceeded the provision for losses for fiscal years  and  even without considering realizations from remarketing activities recorded as leasing margin 
residual values are established equal to the estimated value to be received from the equipment following termination of the lease 
in estimating such values  the company considers all relevant facts regarding the equipment and the lessee  including  for example  the equipment s remarketability  upgrade potential and the probability that the equipment will continue to be installed in place at the end of the initial lease term 
the nature of the company s leasing activities is that it has credit exposure and residual value exposure and  accordingly  in the ordinary course of business it will incur losses arising from these exposures 
the company performs ongoing quarterly assessments of its assets to identify other than temporary losses in value 
of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued i 
results of operations  continued remarketing of the portfolio and related provision for losses  continued margins from remarketing sales ie  sales occurring after the initial lease term are affected by the number and dollar amount of equipment leases that mature in a particular quarter 
as shown in the table above  because the company sold substantially all new lease originations to its pifs and retained very few lease originations for its own account during the fiscal years preceding fiscal year  and in accordance with gaap  the company does not consolidate the results of its pifs  generally fewer leases have matured and less equipment has been available for remarketing each quarter since may  however  revenue from remarketing sales increased during  compared to primarily due to the sale of approximately million of earth moving equipment and the early termination sale of approximately million of manufacturing equipment 
although fluctuations will occur as discussed in the preceding sentence  in general  remarketing revenue and margin are expected to remain at levels which are lower than fiscal and prior years 
the company s ability to remarket additional amounts of equipment and realize a greater amount of remarketing revenue in future periods is dependent on adding additional leases to its portfolio 
however  adding leases to the company s portfolio will not immediately increase the pool of maturing leases because new leases typically are not remarketed until after their initial term which averages approximately four years 
the company s policy is to record allowances for losses as soon as any other than temporary declines in asset values are known 
however  chargeoffs are recorded upon the termination or remarketing of the underlying assets 
as such  chargeoffs will primarily occur subsequent to the recording of the allowances for losses 
the provision for losses recorded during fiscal year included the following significant items approximately  for other than temporary declines in the value of equipment which occurred primarily because lessees returned equipment to the company at the end of the lease 
the company had previously expected to realize the carrying value of that equipment through lease renewals and proceeds from sale of the equipment to the original lessee 
the fair market value of the equipment re leased or sold to a third party was considerably less than was anticipated 
approximately  as a result of a lease having a net book value of  at february  with a lessee that filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code during the third quarter fiscal the provision for losses recorded during fiscal year included the following significant items approximately  related to the sale of a note receivable on a jet aircraft  and approximately  to write down the carrying value of certain retained residuals 
a reversal of approximately  recorded during fiscal year for estimated loss exposure as discussed below 
of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued i 
results of operations  continued remarketing of the portfolio and related provision for losses  continued the provision for losses recorded during fiscal year included the following approximately  to record the company s loss exposure related to approximately million of net book value of equipment leased to a lessee who filed chapter bankruptcy during july approximately  recorded to write down the carrying value of ibm equipment retained residuals to fair market values based upon current third party quotes approximately  for equipment originally expected to remain with the lessee upon lease termination which was returned to the company approximately  recorded to write down the carrying value of one of the company s aircraft to fair market value because of the deteriorating financial condition of the lessee at may  approximately  to record the company s loss exposure related to approximately  of net book value of equipment leased to another lessee that filed chapter bankruptcy during december the increase in equipment held for sale or re lease primarily reflects one aircraft which was returned to the company upon lease termination 
the company is presently evaluating re lease opportunities and expects to re lease the aircraft during fiscal year leasing margin leasing margin consists of the following in thousands fiscal years ended may  leasing revenue    leasing costs and expenses    net non recourse interest expense on related discounted lease rentals   leasing margin    leasing margin ratio the increase in leasing revenue  leasing costs and expenses and leasing margin was primarily due to growth in the company s lease portfolio  including leases subsequently sold to private investors 
these revenue and expense amounts are expected to increase further as the company continues to grow its lease portfolio 
of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued i 
results of operations  continued leasing margin  continued leasing margin ratio fluctuates based upon i the mix of direct finance leases and operating leases  ii remarketing activities  iii the method used to finance leases added to the company s lease portfolio  as described above and iv the relative age and types of leases in the portfolio operating leases have a relatively lower leasing margin early in the lease term and an increasing leasing margin as the lease term passes 
the majority of leases added to cai s portfolio have been operating leases 
interest expense arising from non recourse bank debt discounted lease rentals is reflected in leasing margin  but interest arising from the warehouse facility is not reflected in leasing margin 
other income other income consists of the following in thousands fiscal years ended may  fees and distributions from the company sponsored pifs    gain on sale of the investment in corporate express  inc stock cancellation of option agreement to acquire certain mining equipment interest on income tax refunds interest on mbank settlement and hold back recovery of sales and property tax amounts previously expensed interest on installment sale of equipment other the company recorded an installment sale contract in connection with the settlement agreement reached with respect to the hemmeter litigation which is discussed in footnote to notes to consolidated financial statements to the form k 
during fiscal year  the company received million of cash payments related to the installment sale 
expected future cash payments and interest income under the installment sale are million and million  respectively 
operating and other expenses operating and other expenses increased million for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase included i  for commissions related to the increase in business volume  ii  for expenses principally related to training  travel and employee acquisitions and iii  for consulting fees and expenses of the company s majority shareholder 
operating and other expenses decreased approximately million for fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to on going efforts to improve operating efficiency 
the decrease included i million of capitalized initial direct costs due to lease origination volume and ii  related to on going efforts to minimize costs 
the decrease also included the following significant expense reductions  of legal fees primarily related to the mbank litigation and the hemmeter litigation 
 of warehouse and other lease portfolio and asset management costs 
 of current insurance costs 
of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued i 
results of operations  continued interest income and expense interest income arises when equipment financed with non recourse debt is sold to investors 
the accompanying consolidated statements of income reflect an equal amount of non recourse interest expense 
the decline in interest income and the related non recourse interest expense is due to a decline in the average outstanding balance of non recourse debt with respect to equipment sold to investors 
net non recourse interest expense on related discounted lease rentals increased due to an increase in the average outstanding balance of related discounted lease rentals 
it is anticipated that net non recourse interest expense on related discounted lease rentals will increase in the future as the company adds additional leases financed with non recourse debt to its portfolio 
recourse interest expense decreased during fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  due to the continuing reductions in the outstanding balance term loan portion of the company s debt facility 
income taxes as shown in the table in note to notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company s significant deferred tax assets consist of an itc carryforward of million which expires from through and alternative minimum tax amt credits of million which are not subject to expiration 
these tax assets are available to offset federal income tax liability 
however  the amount of itc and amt credit carryforward that may be utilized to reduce tax liability is significantly limited due to the computation of amt liability 
as a result of the future expiration of the itc carryforward  the company has established a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reflect the uncertainty that the itc carryforward will be fully utilized prior to expiration 
income tax expense is provided on income at the appropriate statutory rates applicable to such earnings 
the appropriate statutory federal and state income tax rate for fiscal years  and was 
adjustments to the valuation allowance are recognized as a separate component of the provision for income tax expense 
consequently  the actual income tax rate for fiscal years and was less than the effective rate of primarily due to the reduction in the valuation allowance 
the reduction of the valuation allowance recorded in fiscal represents the utilization of an itc carryforward and the receipt of a state income tax refund for which a valuation allowance had been provided 
the reduction of the valuation allowance recorded in fiscal represents the utilization of an itc carryforward for which a valuation allowance had been provided 
during fiscal year  a transaction was completed in which the company s largest shareholder obtained more than fifty percent of the ownership and voting rights of the company within a three year period a change in control 
upon a change in control  provisions of the internal revenue code limit the amount of itc carryforwards and amt carryforwards that could be utilized to reduce income tax liability in any year 
however  the company had previously established a valuation allowance for deferred taxes due to uncertainty that the full amount of the itc carryforward would be utilized prior to expiration and therefore  the change in control and resulting limitation on the itc and amt carryforward is not expected to reduce the recoverability of the amount of the deferred income tax assets  net of the valuation allowance

liquidity and capital resources the company s activities are principally funded by proceeds from sales of on lease equipment to its pifs or private investors  non recourse debt  recourse bank debt see note to notes to consolidated financial statements  rents  fees and distributions from its pifs  sales or re leases of equipment after the expiration of the initial lease terms and other cash receipts from non recurring items such as settlements of legal proceedings 
management believes the company s ability to generate cash from operations is sufficient to fund operations  as shown in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
the company s bank facility has been extended through november  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s bank facility 
the company began offering units of its latest pif  cpyf iv  for sale during april during fiscal year  the company has up to million of class a units in cpyf iv available for sale  which will represent a source of liquidity and acquisition fee income for the company 
two of the company s pifs  including cpyf iv  are using a portion of their available cash to purchase additional equipment from the company 
the company expects to sell approximately million of equipment to these pifs during fiscal year five of the company s pifs are in their liquidation stage and are no longer purchasing material amounts of equipment 
for two of those pifs  the company is evaluating whether it would be in the best interests of class a unit holders to accelerate the liquidation of the pif s portfolio of leases 
should liquidation be accelerated  the company will immediately realize its class b investment in the pifs 
inflation has not had a significant impact upon the operations of the company
