item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations upper peninsula energy corporation the company is the parent of upper peninsula power company uppco  an electric utility  and two nonutility subsidiaries 
the utility operations of uppco are the primary source of earnings 
earnings earnings per share in were compared with in and in the decrease in earnings is attributable to a full year impact of a reduction in retail rates in april and a decline in large industrial sales  offset by a reduction of maintenance expenditures 
earnings declined slightly in as a reduction in operation and maintenance expense  exclusive of power supply costs  combined with a increase in energy sales  offset the april rate decrease 
sales and revenues the majority of operating revenues come from the sale of electricity based on rates authorized by the michigan public service commission mpsc and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
over the past three years  approximately of energy sales revenues were under the jurisdiction of the mpsc 
fluctuations in revenues occur because of changes in rates  power supply costs  number of customers  weather  and energy consumption trends 
power supply cost recovery matches fuel and purchased power cost changes and does not affect earnings 
in  operating revenues were lower than in because of lower power supply costs  reduced sales  and the april retail rate reduction 
operating revenues in were lower than in the april rate reduction and a slight decrease in power supply costs were the major reasons for the lower revenues 
sales of electric energy accounted for of operating revenues in electric sales in   and were  mwh   mwh  and  mwh  which included  mwh   mwh  and  mwh  respectively  sold at a non firm emergency rate established in for certain large industrial customers 
excluding emergency sales  and energy sales were up and  respectively 
in the past two years  there has been a general rise in sales  with the exception of large industrials due in large part to the closure of the ki sawyer air force base in september small commercial sales continue to lead the way  rising by in following a gain in sales to ki sawyer air force base accounted for   and  of revenues in   and  respectively 
new load continues to develop on the base site 
customers with firm energy requirements exceeding  mwh in either of the past two years were mwh mwh change stone container corporation   city of gladstone   michigan technological university   city of negaunee   ontonagon rea   lakehead pipeline company   k

sawyer air force base   operating expenses operating expenses decreased in following a decline in power supply costs fuel and purchased power accounted for   and of operating expenses in   and  respectively 
power supply costs change depending on overall system energy requirements  unit production costs for generation  and purchased power rates 
purchased power represented   and of output to lines in   and  respectively 
the decrease in the percentage of uppco s energy requirements purchased in was due to a increase in hydro generation resulting from record snowfalls and a late spring 
power supply costs decreased and in and  respectively 
these costs on a per unit basis decreased in because of a higher hydro generation and reduced purchased power costs 
in  power supply costs decreased on a per unit basis  more than offsetting increased energy requirements 
other operation expenses were higher in as the reduced costs associated with fewer employees were offset by increased outside service needs associated with such areas as the changing regulatory climate and other strategic or operational changes 
in  other operation expenses were lower as a result of reduced employment levels and associated benefit costs 
in  maintenance expenses decreased because of reduced tree trimming and production plant expenditures 
maintenance expenses were lower in despite additional tree trimming and production plant expenditures because of ash site closure costs in depreciation and amortization expense  which is normally a function of plant in service  decreased in following a increase in the decrease in the current year was due to an increase in the estimated service life of the victoria hydro facility 
ad valorem taxes increased and in and  respectively  due to additional plant in service 
total interest charges increased slightly in due to additional short term borrowing requirements 
in  interest charges remained relatively unchanged  as most cash needs were satisfied internally 
future outlook in michigan  the implementation of customer choice has been studied for several years 
governor john engler requested the mpsc to refine and act upon a blueprint for competition issued in january in december  commission staff issued a report that recommends a restructuring approach that would allow customers to choose their electric power supplier over a phase in period through the mpsc staff report provides utilities the opportunity to recover stranded costs through a transition charge for customers who choose alternative energy suppliers 
concepts such as a performance based cost recovery system  rate reduction bonds  and service reliability standards are also addressed in the report 
the mpsc has not yet acted on the staff proposal  which is also subject to public comment 
while we believe that the issues will be debated by interest groups with opposing needs  it appears that customer choice will be available to some degree in michigan in the near future 
in its order  ferc required each utility with transmission lines that could potentially be used for buying or selling wholesale energy to file an open access tariff for transmission services 
this tariff unbundles or isolates transmission services from the complete delivery packages that make up most utility rates 
order also defines the terms  conditions  and rates for transmission services to be provided by transmission system owners 
we filed our tariff on january  another ferc order would have required us to separate our power marketing function from our transmission operations and planning function and to post our transmission capacity availability and tariff rates on an electronic bulletin board via the internet 
we requested and were granted a waiver from these requirements because of our small size and the additional expense involved with compliance 
we cannot predict with any certainty the final outcome of deregulation efforts or their effect on uppco 
however  because of uppco s relatively limited energy sales growth projections and the ever increasing competitive nature of the electric business  we continue to concentrate on efforts to reduce costs and develop a more efficient organization to improve our competitive position 
management believes that uppco meets the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and that all regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
in the event uppco no longer meets the criteria of sfas  such regulatory assets would be removed 
uppco s work force involved in regulated utility activities has decreased by over the last three years  from employees at the beginning of to at december  in addition to normal retirements  these reductions were accomplished through voluntary retirements  severance programs  and layoffs 
we are near the employee complement needed for the future  and further cost reductions will likely come through workplace efficiencies and operational changes 
the company has entered into an agreement with the michigan department of natural resources to monitor groundwater surrounding the john h 
warden station ash landfill  which was closed in such monitoring is to be performed over a year period 
at december   the company has recorded an estimated liability of  offset by a regulatory asset of  being amortized over the monitoring period 
under contract with wisconsin electric power company wepco  uppco has staffed and operated wepco s presque isle power plant located in marquette  michigan  since under the terms of the agreement  uppco receives a management fee plus reimbursement for all costs associated with labor and other services provided 
in december  wepco gave notification that it intends to terminate the contract on december  the terms of the agreement call for all uppco employees at the plant to be offered employment by wepco 
uppco and wepco representatives have begun efforts to ensure an orderly transition 
uppco management believes that this action will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash needs are principally for construction expenditures and debt retirement 
cash is generated through internal operations and external financing 
to meet short term cash needs  credit agreements are maintained with certain banks 
these agreements are reviewed annually in the second quarter of the year 
when short term borrowings grow beyond normal seasonal requirements  they are replaced with long term financing 
the company had  of short term notes outstanding at december   and had  of unused lines of credit available at or below the prime rate 
substantial cash flows are generated annually from operating activities 
net cash from this source was  in   in  and  in during the three year period through  there were no long term financing activities 
in  the company repurchased  common shares on the open market for  investment activities in   and totalled  of capital expenditures  of which  was spent on a transmission line project chandler to improve service to delta county 
this project is scheduled for completion in march other utility expenditures were primarily for distribution and transmission improvements  new service requests  and equipment replacement 
utility capital expenditures are expected to be  in cash requirements will be met primarily with short term borrowings and internally generated funds 
in through  the company is forecasting  of capital expenditures for system improvements and replacements 
the company estimates that almost all cash requirements will be internally generated 
due to its capital intensive nature  the utility industry is influenced by inflation 
uppco s current utility regulation recognizes only original cost rate base 
however  assuming the continued ability to bill customers for increases in power supply costs and the receipt of adequate and timely rate relief  uppco will recover cost escalations caused by inflation
