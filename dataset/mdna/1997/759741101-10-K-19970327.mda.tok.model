in  the company continued to expand its route network and flight operations and  despite rising jet fuel prices  recurring west coast fare sales primarily initiated by a major competitor and increased maintenance expense  the company recorded its second consecutive annual profit 
for the year  reno air posted a net profit of  an increase of versus  grew available seat mile asm capacity by  and carried a total of  passengers 
management believes that the company s net profit was achieved as a result of its maturing route structure  and increased market awareness of its high quality  low cost product 
the company also benefited from efficiencies resulting from its expanded base of operations  increased aircraft and asset utilization and increased charter flying 
in  the company s fleet increased to an average of aircraft  from in the prior year 
this added aircraft capacity enabled reno air to generate a total of  asms  up over at the same time  revenue passenger miles rpms grew by  to  producing an annual load factor of  versus in the company s load factor has increased in each of the last three years 
total passengers carried in increased by to  while passenger stage length  or the average distance of each one way passenger trip  increased by  to miles 
management believes that passenger stage length increased in response to the company s added capacity in long haul markets and its increased scheduling focus on hubbing  which increases the number of connecting destinations and flights available to a passenger traveling over a reno air hub city 
in  the company began serving three new year round markets  denver  san francisco and fairbanks  alaska 
it also expanded operations in a number of existing markets including portland seattle  anchorage seattle and reno colorado springs  and expanded its charter business 
reno air competes primarily with southwest airlines  alaska airlines  and shuttle by united tm 
southwest airlines is the company s main competitor  in that it operates non stop service in a majority of the company s non stop markets 
no other carrier competes head to head in more than of the company s non stop markets 
in  southwest airlines initiated highly stimulative marketing programs on the west coast including wide spread availability of  or non stop fares 
many of the company s passengers are substantially price sensitive  so the company matched these fare levels 
financial results are very sensitive to external revenue and cost factors including industry fare levels and fuel prices 
fare levels can change rapidly 
management believes that the west coast fare sales described above reduced the company s profitability and cannot predict whether  or to what degree  such sales may recur 
in  the company experienced fuel prices that averaged higher than levels  which increased the company s fuel expense by million as compared to what fuel expense would have been at the average price of fuel paid in fuel prices increased each quarter in and were at their highest level in the fourth quarter 
although fuel prices continued to increase in january  they have since declined moderately 
management cannot predict whether fuel prices will remain at these levels  will increase further  or will return to lower levels 
the company entered into a codeshare relationship in september  with american eagle carrier wings west airlines  under which reno air s marketing code qq is carried on some american eagle flights into and out of los angeles international airport 
the company also entered into a codeshare relationship with hawaiian airlines in november under which hawaiian s marketing code ha is carried on some of reno air flights into and out of los angeles 
these agreements permit passengers to book travel under a single airline code for travel connecting between the carriers 
on january   the federal excise tax applicable to domestic passenger air travel expired 
in august  the tax was reinstated through december  the tax was again reinstated on march   effective through september  the expiration and reinstatement of these taxes can raise or lower the net ticket revenue that the company generates on ticket sales  although the precise value of that cost or benefit is difficult to assess 
congress is studying an alternate user fee or tax system which  depending on its structure  could disproportionately impact low fare carriers like the company 
in  reno air increased its usage of teletech  inc to supplement the company s internal reservations capacity  thus boosting its direct sales 
this significantly increased the company s call handling capability 
the company began using a new automated yield management system in july to optimize its revenues by better allocating the optimal amount of discount seat inventory on each flight 
the international brotherhood of teamsters has filed an application with the national mediation board to represent the company s flight attendants 
the nmb has advised the company that ballots are being mailed to flight attendants on march   and will be counted on april  if unionization of the company s employees occurs  the company s flexibility in dealing with its employees would be restricted  which could result in a material increase in costs and the company would be required to negotiate a contract with the union 
management cannot predict the timing of such negotiations if a union were to be elected  when a contract might be entered into  or the extent such a contract would contain terms different from the company s current work and pay rules 
the west coast  and reno in particular  experienced unusually harsh weather at the beginning of  including a new year s day flood which shut the reno tahoe airport and reno air s reno reservations office for approximately hours 
although these facilities and the city of reno in general  recovered rapidly from the flood  the adverse publicity surrounding the flood depressed tourist and gambling traffic to reno for at least six weeks 
reno air s results for the first quarter of will reflect the adverse impact of the flood 
management expects the company to grow at a significantly slower rate in than the company experienced in  as management focuses on improving profitability of the existing fleet 
results of operations in  the company generated net income of  or cent per share  slightly higher than the  net income also cent per share  earned in in  the company had a net loss of  or per share 
operating income for was  versus  in  and an operating loss of  in the company s net earnings were achieved despite a difficult operating and competitive environment characterized by widespread fare sales throughout the year  and fuel prices that averaged higher than in in  continued over capacity on the west coast  due to added flying by the company  southwest airlines  alaska airlines and shuttle by united tm  led to intense competition to attract passengers and numerous attempts  primarily by other airlines  to stimulate additional traffic through fare initiatives 
management believes that certain of these fare initiatives were earnings dilutive  in that revenue generated did not fully cover average passenger carrying costs 
as a result of these fare sales  the company s load factor increased significantly versus  from to in however  these fare sales and an increase in average passenger stage length reduced passenger yields from cent in to cent in as a result  breakeven load factor climbed from to for the comparable periods  and earnings from to were generally flat 
revenue derived from ticket sales is recognized at the time transportation is provided 
however  some tickets sold are never used  refunded  or matched to ticket lifts  and become breakage  which is estimated and recognized as revenue 
in  as in  the company benefited from a re estimation of ticket breakage recognized during the year that resulted in fourth quarter adjustments of approximately million in and million in the significant improvement in the company s operating results from to reflected a increase in unit revenues yield per asm due to an increase in passenger yield from cent to cent  and an increase in load factor from to  along with a decrease in unit expenses cost per asm spread over a increase in the company s available seat miles 
operating revenues total revenues in grew  to  as compared to  in in  the company generated  in operating revenues 
passenger revenue increased to  in  versus  in  and was up versus its total of  in  the company s fleet increased to an average of aircraft  from in the prior year 
this added aircraft capacity enabled reno air to generate a total of  asms  up over from to  passenger revenue growth resulted from a increase in rpms and a increase in yield per rpm 
other revenues  comprised primarily of cargo  mail  ad hoc charters and qquickescapes tour revenues  grew to  in  from  in and  in they accounted for   and  respectively  of  and total revenues 
growth in other revenues year to year resulted primarily from the company s increased charter flying 
operating expenses despite high jet fuel prices in  the company maintained a cost structure that is one of the lowest in the industry  and the company s unit costs remained competitive with its chief low fare competitor  southwest airlines  despite the company offering a full service product versus southwest s no frills product 
total operating expenses grew in line with capacity  from  in to  in  up year over year 
operating expenses in totaled  on a unit cost basis  the company s operating cost structure grew from cent per asm in  to cent in however  fuel price increases year over year added million to operating expenses  or approximately cent per asm 
on a pro forma basis  holding fuel prices constant from to  the company s operating unit costs would have declined from cent in to cent in the company s operating costs were cent per asm 
a number of cost categories  including aircraft leases  commissions  facilities leases  and insurance  saw meaningful unit cost reductions from to due to economies of scale and greater aircraft utilization 
commission expense costs were reduced by as the company increased the percentage of tickets it sold directly through its reservations and airport ticket offices 
this resulted in part from the company s outsourcing of overflow reservations calls to teletech 
facilities lease costs declined by as the company grew its overall capacity primarily within its existing facilities  thereby increasing utilization 
the company lowered insurance costs in by by negotiating lower insurance rates 
management cannot predict future insurance rates 
cost categories which experienced significant year over year unit cost increases included aircraft fuel  maintenance inspections and repairs  advertising and sales  and depreciation and amortization 
in addition to rising market prices for jet fuel  fuel costs in were impacted by the expiration  effective october   of the cent per gallon aviation fuel tax exemption from federal excise taxes 
maintenance costs increased in as a result of industry airworthiness directives  fleet interior refurbishments  general aging of the fleet  and expiration of manufacturer warranties 
advertising  sales and distribution costs increased as the company devoted more resources to develop new markets and solidify reno air s marketing presence in core west coast markets 
sales costs also increased due to the company s contract with teletech to handle reservations call overflow until the company s las vegas reservations center is completed 
management believes that this outsourcing enabled the company to respond to customer calls more quickly  and sell more tickets 
depreciation and amortization costs increased by year over year as the company increased its flight equipment assets from million to million with the purchase of two aircraft and four spare engines 
in the same timeframe  ground property and equipment grew from million to million  primarily resulting from the company s construction of a new maintenance hanger 
from to  the company s unit cost declined as a result of  among other factors  a increase in aircraft utilization  a increase in average passenger stage length and efficiencies from the company s increased size  offset by a increase in the average cost per gallon of fuel from to 
part of the fuel cost increase was due to the expiration  effective october   of the cent per gallon aviation fuel exemption from federal excise taxes

at the same time  property and equipment grew year over year from million to million  as the company acquired two aircraft and four spare engines  and built a new maintenance hangar during the year 
current liabilities increased year over year  as well  from million to million  primarily from an increase in the company s accrued liabilities  air traffic liability  and current maturities of long term debt 
long term debt grew year over year from million to million primarily due to the company acquiring aircraft and aircraft engines 
other non current liabilities increased from million to million 
shareholders equity increased by million  to million year over year  primarily due to the million profit and the exercise of warrants and stock options

net cash provided by operations totaled million  versus million in the prior year 
investing activities used a total of million  versus million in  principally for the purchase of property and equipment  which used million and million  respectively 
the company generated million from the sale of equipment in short term investment transactions generated  of net proceeds in  and used million of cash in financing activities provided the company million during the year  of which million resulted from financing on an aircraft and spare engines that the company purchased  partially offset by million used to service principal payments on notes

the company s aggregate minimum annual lease payment service for  as of december  was million 
in march  the company took delivery of its first two md jet aircraft from mcdonnell douglas 
it deployed these aircraft principally to operate out of orange county airport in southern california  because the mds can operate under even the most stringent noise limitations in place at the airport 
the third md was placed in service in august to provide additional seat capacity to chicago o hare and to establish new service from orange county to san francisco 
during  the company operated an average of md and md aircraft and  as of december   the company s fleet totaled aircraft 
two aircraft  an md and an md  were owned by the company  while the remainder are leased under operating leases with initial terms of between and years 
the md aircraft owned by the company has been leased to another carrier for an initial month term through may  and management expects to renew this lease for a period of to months upon expiration of the current lease 
in march  the company expects to take delivery of an md aircraft under a six year lease 
this aircraft will be used to support the company s planned scheduled service expansion on may  the company has also been in discussions to purchase an md aircraft on expiration of its lease in july in september   the company canceled a fuel purchase agreement with american airlines which provided reno air with access to a million revolving line of credit on fuel purchases 
the company initiated this cancellation to cease paying american an administrative service charge for this fuel purchasing service and to release american s lien on a substantial portion of the company s assets 
management believes that the company s current cash balances  cash flow generated from operations and its short term investments will  in the aggregate  be sufficient to meet its obligations  liquidity and capital needs for the next twelve months 
subject to market conditions  the company may seek to boost its liquidity by pursuing a public or private offering of its equity or debt securities 
management believes the company also has several options to increase cash through sales or re financings of its owned aircraft and spare engines 
the company s total equity in owned aircraft and spare engines as of december  was million
