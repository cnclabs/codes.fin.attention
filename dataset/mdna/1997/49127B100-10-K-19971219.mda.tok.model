as a result  while the company s business is cyclical in nature  its financial results have been less volatile than those of the domestic steel industry in general 
the company has historically generated sufficient cash flow to meet its capital expenditure and debt service requirements

year ended september  compared with year ended september  net sales 
net sales for fiscal decreased by million to million from million for fiscal due to a decline in shipments 
total shipments for fiscal were approximately  tons  down from fiscal  while the average selling price per ton remained constant with the prior year 
the decline in shipments primarily resulted from the third quarter shutdown caused by a radioactive contamination of the baghouse  continued start up of the ladle metallurgy facility during the first half of fiscal  and the ten day melt shop outage in the second quarter 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for fiscal increased 
million 
to million from million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold is primarily due to higher conversion costs and additional depreciation  partially offset by a decrease in material costs 
conversion costs for fiscal were adversely impacted by lower production during the third quarter due to the day shutdown of the melt shop operations required to decontaminate the baghouse facilities following detection of a radioactive substance in the baghouse dust and by the shutdown and restart of the caster during the second quarter 
the caster was also shut down for repairs for days in late december and early january 
during this day shut down  the company converted an additional caster strand to allow for increased production of thicker  wider products 
the resulting shortage of billets idled the rolling mill for several days and negatively impacted rolling mill production and productivity 
to a lesser degree  conversion costs were also adversely impacted by an increase in repair  maintenance and supply costs  health benefit costs and the continued start up phase of the new ladle metallurgy facility in the first half of fiscal the cost of goods sold for fiscal includes a million reimbursement from business interruption insurance  related to the caster fire

included in the million of gross deferred tax assets is million of net operating tax loss carryforwards which expire beginning in the realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent in part upon generation of sufficient future taxable income 
management has considered the levels of currently anticipated pre tax income in assessing the required level of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
taking into consideration historical pre tax income levels  the nature of certain events which adversely affected operations in fiscal and  the company s return to profitability during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  the continued improvement in productivity and other factors  management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset  after consideration of the valuation allowance which has been established  will be realized 
the amount of the net deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
net income 
as a result of the above  fiscal reflected a net loss of million as compared to net income of  in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  net income decreased from 
in fiscal to in fiscal year ended september  compared with year ended september  net sales 
net sales for fiscal decreased by million to million from million for fiscal due to a decline in shipments and decrease in average selling price 
total shipments for fiscal were approximately  tons  down from fiscal the average selling price per ton decreased by in the decline in shipments has resulted from the continued production problems encountered with the start up of the new finishing facilities during the first half of fiscal  a caster fire during the second quarter  and the start up of the ladle metallurgy facility during the fourth quarter of fiscal  combined with softening demands in certain markets 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for fiscal decreased million to million from million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased from for fiscal to in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributed to an increase in per ton conversion costs and additional depreciation expense 
the problems associated with the start up of the new finishing equipment during the first half of fiscal  the ladle metallurgy facility during the fourth quarter of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  the effect of february s caster fire negatively impacted productivity and increased per ton conversion cost

interest expense increased by 
million to million in fiscal from 
million in fiscal  net of interest capitalized of  and  respectively

gain on involuntary conversion of equipment 
as a result of the caster fire  the company received insurance proceeds of  for the replacement cost of the equipment destroyed which had a net book value of  the excess of the replacement cost over the net book value of the equipment destroyed resulted in a gain of approximately  net income

the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal is primarily due to the completion  in fiscal  of the capital expenditure program which expanded the company s casting  rolling and finishing capacity and increased the size range of products the company can produce  and the completion of the ladle metallurgy facility in fiscal cash flows from investing activities for fiscal also include the proceeds from the involuntary conversion of equipment of 
million 
cash flows provided from financing activities amounted to million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively

impact of inflation and changing prices while the company has not experienced any material long term adverse effects on operations in recent years because of inflation  margins have been affected by inflationary conditions 
the company s primary cost components are steel scrap  labor  and energy  all of which are susceptible to domestic inflationary pressures 
scrap prices are frequently influenced by supply and demand factors as well as general economic conditions 
in contrast  finished product prices are influenced by nationwide economic trends and manufacturing capacity within the steel industry 
while the company has generally been successful in passing on cost increases through price increases  the effect of steel imports  market price competition and under utilized industry capacity has in the past  and could in the future  limit the company s ability to increase prices
