item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and other parts of this form k contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and in risk factors and business 
conductus develops  manufactures  and markets electronic components and systems based on superconductors for applications in communications  healthcare and instrumentation markets 
in may  conductus acquired tristan technologies  inc tristan  a san diego  california based company founded in  that designed  manufactured and sold large scale magnetic sensing systems and instrumentation 
in june  tristan became the conductus instruments and systems division 
as of december   conductus had accumulated losses of approximately  and expects to incur additional losses at least during due to the company s planned expansion of operations 
conductus  alone or with collaborative partners  must successfully develop  manufacture  introduce and market its potential products in order to achieve profitability 
conductus does not expect to recognize meaningful product sales until it successfully develops and commercializes superconductive components  systems and subsystems that address significant market needs 
see risk factors 
results of operations total revenues increased to  in from  in and  in total revenues consist primarily of contract revenue and  to a lesser extent  product sales 
revenue under us government research and development contracts increased to  in from  in and  in and represented   and  of total revenue in   and  respectively 
the increase in contract revenues during is largely attributable to a solid base of contracts from and the addition of several new multi year contracts 
revenues under these new contracts are expected to offset planned declines in revenues from contracts approaching the end of their terms 
the company had  and  in contracts and grants and  and  in awards from us government agencies as of december  and  respectively 
conductus does not anticipate that government contract revenues will grow at historical rates in the future 
the recognition of revenue and receipt of payment pursuant to these contracts and awards are subject to numerous risks 
see business research and development and note of notes to financial statements 
revenue from sales of large scale superconductive magnetic sensing systems  squids  hts thin films and other products increased to  in from  in and  in  primarily due to an increase in sales of superconductive sensor systems and instruments 
the large scale superconductivity systems have large unit prices and are sold in low volumes  and thus significant period to period fluctuations in sales of these systems may occur 
cost of product sales were   and  for   and  respectively 
the cost of products in  and were primarily due to costs of superconducting magnetic systems manufactured by the instrument and systems division 
cost of product sales increased in and due to increased levels of revenues from new products introduced in gross margins were   and for  and  respectively 
gross margins decreased in because of increased sales of large systems which have lower gross margins and increased costs of start up in the sensor portion of the magnetic sensor business 
gross margin in increased over primarily due to lower margins on initial system products which included startup costs in costs of contract revenues are included in research and development expenses and are discussed below 
the company s research and development expenses increased to  in from  in and  in  or   and respectively  of total operating expenses for that year 
these cost increases in and reflect the increase in the company s overall research and development activities  and an emphasis on efforts in wireless and healthcare 
research and development includes both externally and internally funded projects 
externally funded research and development programs  primarily under contracts with agencies of the us government  accounted for approximately  of total operating costs and expenses in  from  in and  in  reflecting increased government contract and research activity throughout the period 
increases in contract revenues in the future  if any  are expected to result in corresponding increases in research and development and general and administrative expenses 
current levels of expenditure are expected to continue for development of commercial products particularly in the wireless and healthcare areas 
in addition  the company expects to continue to incur significant research and development expenses on internally funded programs as it seeks to develop additional commercial products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately  in from  in and  in or   and  respectively  of total costs and expenses in  and  respectively 
these costs increased in and compared to due to the increasing size of the company through the acquisition of tristan in  significant headcount additions and increasing sales and marketing activities 
total headcount has increased to at december  from at december  and at december   respectively 
increases in and over also include the selling costs associated with expanding the company s representative network of independent distributors of magnetic sensing and instrument products 
included in expenses is a non recurring charge of approximately  for severance and recruitment expenses associated with management changes and additions 
additionally  the company expects to continue to incur increasing sales and marketing expenses to the extent it increases sales of commercial products 
the company s total costs and expenses increased to  in from  in and  onin increased emphasis in the wireless and healthcare development added to the total costs and expenses in and are expected to increase total costs and expenses in loss from operations was   and  for   and  respectively 
the increased loss in compared to is primarily related to the increased focus on the wireless market and related development in both pcs and cellular areas 
the modest decline in loss in compared to was primarily related to increases in revenues offset by headcount and contract costs as the company moved towards developing and commercializing products 
interest income from cash equivalents and investments were  in   in  and  in the primary reasons for the changes between years was due to the levels of cash equivalents and investments  and reflect approximately  in net proceeds received in the company s follow on offering in july interest charges were   and  in  and  respectively 
interest charges related to the company s several equipment term loan facilities which were reflected for the entire year in both and compared to only part of as of year end  three lease line obligations existed which and mature over the next to months 
as a result of incurring losses  the company has not incurred any income tax liability 
the company has established a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets and reviews this allowance on a periodic basis 
at such time that the company believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized  the valuation allowance will be reduced 
conductus does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations during the past three fiscal years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company s aggregate cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled  compared to  as of december  the company has financed its operations since inception primarily through  in net proceeds from its initial public offering of common stock in august   in net proceeds from its follow on public offering of common stock in june   raised in private financings   from us government contracts   in aggregate borrowings under three equipment lease lines of credit and equipment term loan s and  in interest income 
net cash used in operations was   and  for   and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in over the prior years was primarily due to an increase in net loss resulting from expanding the company s operations  including headcount and other related costs  which was partially offset by increased revenues 
a significant portion of the increase relates to increased receivables on government contracts and inventories 
the company anticipates that its accounts receivable from revenues under us government contracts and product sales  as well as inventories  will remain consistent with levels during net cash used in investing activities was  in primarily from the increase in short term investments from the follow on offering in june and the purchases of property and equipment 
during and  net cash of  and  was provided by investing activities from the net reduction in investments  offset by purchases of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment in increased  over the prior year primarily reflecting expenditures to expand the company s facilities in which approximated  and increased equipment needs for research and development and operations 
net cash from financing activities was   and  in  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in was were primarily due to the company s follow on offering in june and borrowings under the company s equipment loans  offset by principal payments under capital lease obligations and equipment term loans 
net cash provided by financing activities in and was primarily due to borrowings under the company s equipment term loan and proceeds from issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase plan offset by principal payments under capital lease obligations 
the company to date has received limited revenues from product sales 
the development of the company s potential products will require a commitment of substantial funds to conduct further research and development and testing of its potential products  to establish commercial scale manufacturing and to market any resulting products 
the company expects to use significant amounts of cash for capital equipment and support operations until product revenues can contribute 
the actual amount of the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued progress in its research and development programs  the magnitude of these programs  the time and costs involved in obtaining any required regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patents  successful completion of technological  manufacturing and marketing requirements  changes in existing research relationships  the availability of funding under government contracts  the ability of the company to establish collaborative arrangements and the cost of manufacturing scale up and the amount of future revenues 
conductus anticipates that its existing available cash and  of available borrowing under the company s various lines of credit term loan facilities see note to the financial statements will be adequate to fund the company s operations through at least the end of without including funding that may be available under existing and future government contracts 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all  if required 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
sfas earnings per share  and statement no 
sfas disclosures of information about capital structure 
these statements are expected to be effective for the company s first quarter in and will require a revised presentation of earnings per share 
early adoption of the new standards is not permitted and apart from the impact on earnings per share  the impact will not be material to the company s financial position or results of operations
