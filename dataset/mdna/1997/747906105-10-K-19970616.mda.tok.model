item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal sales 
sales in fiscal increased  to billion  compared with sales of billion in fiscal the increase reflected an increase in shipments of disk drives  tape drives  and tape drive related products  as well as an increase in the average drive price 
the increase in the average drive price reflected a change in sales mix to more advanced  larger capacity drives  market demand  and the limited market availability of higher capacity drives 
partially offsetting the increase in sales was a decline particularly in the first through third quarters of fiscal in high end disk drive sales 
this decline resulted from the transition of the manufacture of high end disk drives to mke during fiscal  with older products ceasing production in july  and new high end drives not ramping until the third and fourth quarters of fiscal sales to the company s top five customers were of sales in fiscal  compared with in fiscal sales to compaq computer  inc were million  or of sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal sales to hewlett packard were million  or of sales  in fiscal  and were less than of sales in fiscal sales to apple computer  inc were less than of sales in fiscal  compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal the split of fiscal sales between oems and distribution channels was billion and billion  or and of sales  respectively  compared with billion and billion  or and of sales  respectively  in fiscal sales to the oems and the distribution channels were based on product availability and demand 
gross margin rate 
the gross margin rate increased percentage points to in fiscal  from in fiscal the increase reflected a higher proportion of tape drive and tape drive related product sales in fiscal  compared to fiscal  as these products achieved a higher gross margin rate than sales of other products of the company 
the percentage point gross margin rate increase in fiscal also reflected the impact of a resizing charge in fiscal of million  of which million impacted the gross margin 
the fiscal gross margin rate would have been without the resizing charge 
research and development expenses 
in fiscal  the company s investment in research and development was million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal the million increase in research and development spending reflected higher expenses related to preproduction activity for a number of new products for both the desktop and high capacity drive markets 
research and development spending also reflected management s continuing focus on the development and timely introduction of new information storage products and technologies 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses in fiscal are expected to be consistent with those of fiscal sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal were million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales in fiscal the fiscal decline in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales reflected the increase in sales and management imposed spending constraints early in the year 
as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expenses in fiscal are expected to be consistent with those of fiscal general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in expenses in fiscal reflected expansion of the company s infrastructure 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses in fiscal are expected to be slightly above those of fiscal to support business activities 
interest and other income expense 
net interest and other income and expense in fiscal was million net expense  compared with million net expense in fiscal  reflecting an increase in interest expense as a result of an approximately million increase in the average amount of debt outstanding in fiscal  compared with fiscal the debt was utilized to finance operations 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared with in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable primarily to the benefit of foreign earnings taxed at less than the us rate and a reversal of the federal valuation allowance previously provided for certain state deferred tax assets 
the federal valuation allowance was reversed in fiscal as a result of the realization of the federal deferred tax assets through tax planning 
for financial reporting purposes  the company has provided a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets that are expected to reverse over a year period 
the company believes that the valuation allowance is needed to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has concluded that taxable income expected to be generated over future years  combined with the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  will be sufficient to realize the benefits of the remaining deferred tax assets 
net income 
after tax earnings increased to a net income of million in fiscal  from a net loss of million in fiscal the change to a net income in fiscal from a net loss in fiscal reflects the impact of the million fiscal charge related to the transition of high capacity product manufacturing to mke 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales 
sales in fiscal increased  to billion  compared with sales of billion in fiscal the increase reflected an increase in drive shipments and a change in sales mix to more advanced  larger capacity products 
the increase was partially offset by a decline in average drive prices for older products 
the increase in sales also reflected a full year s sale of products acquired in the october   purchase of the disks  heads and tapes businesses of the storage business unit of digital equipment corporation the acquired businesses 
on a pro forma basis  the company s sales in fiscal would have been billion had the acquisition of the acquired businesses occurred at the beginning of fiscal sales to the company s top five customers were of sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal sales to compaq computer  inc were million  or of sales  in fiscal  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal sales to apple computer  inc were million  or of sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal the split of fiscal sales between oems and distribution channels was billion and billion  or and of sales  respectively  compared with billion and billion  or and of sales  respectively  in fiscal sales to distribution channels increased during fiscal as the company widened its customer base 
gross margin rate 
the gross margin rate decreased to in fiscal  compared with in fiscal the decrease in gross margin rate was attributable to product qualification issues that contributed to higher costs and lower than expected unit volumes in the high capacity product line 
in addition  a million resizing charge recorded in fiscal impacted the gross margin by million 
without this resizing charge  the gross margin rate for fiscal would have been 
research and development expenses 
in fiscal  the company invested million  or of sales  in research and development  compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in fiscal reflected the impact of a full year of expenses for the acquired businesses  along with higher expenses related to preproduction activity for a larger number of new products 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal were million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in expenses in fiscal was due primarily to the costs associated with supporting the company s higher sales volume 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in expenses in fiscal reflected expansion of the company s infrastructure 
other operating charges 
in fiscal  the company included in results of operations a charge of million related to the transition of manufacturing for the high capacity products to mke 
the charge was comprised of reduction in work force of approximately million  write down of capital assets of approximately million  incremental inventory write downs and excess purchase commitment accruals of approximately million  and other charges of approximately million 
these amounts reflect the provision for closing the manufacturing facilities in penang  malaysia  and milpitas  california 
as a result of the acquisition of the acquired businesses in fiscal  the company incurred a charge of million  which included million of purchased in process research and development and million in related merger costs 
merger costs comprised of incremental integration costs incurred through the end of the quarter in which the acquisition was consummated 
interest and other income expense 
net interest and other income and expense in fiscal was million net expense  compared with million net expense in fiscal the increase in net expense in fiscal resulted from interest expense on higher levels of debt used to finance operations 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared with in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable primarily to the realization of deferred tax assets previously reserved and lower overall state taxes  offset by a reduction in the benefit of foreign earnings taxed at less than the us rate 
net income loss 
after tax earnings decreased to a net loss of million in fiscal from a net income of million in fiscal the change to a net loss in fiscal from a net income in fiscal reflected the impact of the million fiscal charge related to the transition of high capacity product manufacturing to mke 
liquidity and capital resources the company generated improved cash flow from operations  aggregating million in fiscal at march   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to million at march  cash was provided by operating activities  primarily from net income and a decrease in inventory  and was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
cash used in investing activities reflected investment in property and equipment 
cash was also provided by financing activities as a result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily from the employee stock purchase plan and from the mortgage arrangement  described below  partially offset by net pay down on the senior credit facility 
the company has a senior credit facility that includes a million term loan and a million revolving credit line with a million outstanding balance at march  the term loan  which began to amortize on december   will amortize over six remaining quarterly payments 
the company expects to spend approximately million for capital equipment  expansion of the company s facilities  and leasehold improvements in fiscal these capital expenditures will support the tapes business  research and development  general corporate operations  and the company s involvement in the recording heads operations 
the company believes that it will be able to fund these capital requirements at least through fiscal refer to the future capital needs section of the trends and uncertainties section for additional discussion of capital 
the company extended until september an million unsecured letter of credit facility with certain banks to issue standby letters of credit to mke and its affiliates 
in september  the company entered into a million mortgage financing related to certain domestic facilities at an effective interest rate of approximately 
the term of the mortgage is years  with monthly payments based on a year amortization period  and a balloon payment at the end of the year term 
the company believes that its existing capital resources  including credit facilities and any cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet all currently planned expenditures and sustain operations for the next fiscal year 
however  this belief assumes that operating results and cash flow from operations will meet the company s expectations  and actual results could vary due to the factors described in the trends and uncertainties section which follows 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt 
trends and uncertainties operating in the information storage industry  quantum is affected by numerous trends and uncertainties  some of which are specific to the industry while others relate more specifically to quantum 
these are discussed below 
trends and uncertainties information storage industry the numerous trends and uncertainties inherent in the information storage industry are summarized below 
following the summary is a discussion of how these trends and uncertainties specifically impact the company 
o intense competition the information storage products industry in general  and the disk drive industry in particular  is characterized by intense competition that results in rapid price erosion  short product life cycles  and continuous introduction of new  more cost effective products offering increased levels of capacity and performance 
o rapid technological change technology advancement in the information storage industry is increasingly rapid 
o customer concentration high purchase volume customers for information storage products are concentrated within a small number of computer system manufacturers  distribution channels  and system integrators 
o fluctuating product demand the demand for hard disk drive products depends on the demand for the computer systems in which hard disk drives are used  which in turn is affected by computer system product cycles and by prevailing economic conditions 
o intellectual property conflicts the hard disk drive industry has been characterized by significant litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights 
intensely competitive industry 
to compete within the information storage industry  quantum frequently introduces new products and transitions to newer versions of existing products 
product introductions and transitions are significant to the operating results of quantum  and if they are not successful  the company would be materially and adversely affected 
the hard disk drive industry also tends to experience periods of excess product inventory and intense price competition 
if price competition intensifies  the company may be forced to lower prices more than expected  which could materially adversely affect the company 
in addition  the company s customers could commence the manufacture of disk and tape drives for their own use or for sale to others 
any such loss of customers could have a material adverse effect on the company 
quantum faces direct competition from a number of companies  including seagate  western digital  ibm which recently increased its investment in its storage business  maxtor and exabyte 
in the event that the company is unable to compete effectively with these or any other company  the company would be materially adversely affected 
the company s information storage product competition can be further broken down as follows desktop storage products 
in the market for desktop products  quantum competes primarily with seagate  western digital  and maxtor 
quantum and its competitors have developed and are developing a number of products targeted at particular segments of this market  such as business users and home pc buyers  and factors such as time to market can have a significant effect on the success of any particular product 
the desktop market is characterized by more competitors and shorter product life cycles than the hard disk drive market in general 
workstation and system storage products 
the company faces competition in the high capacity disk drive market primarily from seagate and ibm 
seagate has the largest share of the market for high capacity disk drives 
although the same competitive factors identified above as being generally applicable to the overall disk drive industry apply to high capacity disk drives  the company believes that the performance and quality of its products are more important to the users in this market than to users in the desktop market 
the company s success in the high capacity market during the foreseeable future is dependent on the successful development  timely introduction  and market acceptance of key new products  as to which there can be no assurance 
specialty storage products 
in the market for tape drives  the company competes with other companies that have tape drive product offerings 
the company targets a market segment that requires a mission critical backup system and competes in this segment based on the reliability and durability of its tape drives 
although the company has experienced excellent market acceptance of its tape drive products  the market could become significantly more competitive at any time during fiscal or beyond 
as a result  the company could experience increased price competition 
if price competition occurs  the company may be forced to lower prices  in which case the company could be materially adversely affected 
rapid technological change  new product development  and qualification 
the combination of an environment of rapid technological changes  short product life cycles and competitive pressures results in gross margins on specific products decreasing rapidly 
accordingly  any delay in introduction of more advanced and more cost effective products can result in significantly lower sales and gross margins 
the company s future is therefore dependent on its ability to anticipate what customers will demand and to develop the new products to meet this demand 
the company must also qualify new products with its customers  successfully introduce these products to the market on a timely basis  and commence volume production to meet customer demands 
for example  during the first quarter of fiscal the company expects to introduce a new desktop product that will account for a significant portion of the company s sales 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully qualify this new desktop product with its customers on a timely basis or that such product will be produced in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand 
due to these factors  the company expects that sales of new products will continue to account for a significant portion of its future sales and that sales of older products will decline accordingly 
the company is frequently in the process of qualifying new products with its customers 
the customer qualification process for disk drive products  particularly high capacity products  can be lengthy  complex  and difficult 
in addition  the company transitioned the manufacturing of its high capacity products to mke during the first half of fiscal  and mke has only recently begun volume production of such high capacity products 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain additional customer qualifications for new products in a timely manner  or at all  or in the event that mke is unable to continue to manufacture such products in volume and with consistent high quality  the company would be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in the development and marketing of any new products and components in response to technological change or evolving industry standards  that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these products and components  or that the company s new products and components will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
in addition  technological advances in magnetic  optical or other technologies  or the development of new technologies  could result in the introduction of competitive products with superior performance to and substantially lower prices than the company s products 
further  the company s new products and components are subject to significant technological risks 
if the company experiences delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of new products or components  the company could experience delays or loss of product sales 
if the company is unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  the company would be materially adversely affected 
customer concentration 
in addition to the information storage industry and the company s customer base being concentrated  the customers generally are not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of the company s products  and the company s relationships with its customers are generally terminable at will by its customers 
sales of the company s desktop products  which comprise a majority of its overall sales  were concentrated with several key customers in fiscal and sales to the top five customers of the company represented and of total sales in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  the company is unable to predict whether or not there will be any significant change in demand for any of its customers products in the future 
in the event that any such changes result in decreased demand for the company s products  whether by loss of or delays in orders  the company could be materially adversely affected 
fluctuation in product demand 
fluctuation in demand for the company s products generally results in fluctuations in the company s operating results 
demand for computer systems especially in the pc market segment  where the company derives a significant amount of its disk drive sales has historically been subject to significant fluctuations 
such fluctuations in end user demand have in the past  and may in the future  result in the deferral or cancellation of orders for the company s products  each of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
during the past several years  there has been significant growth in the demand for pcs  a portion of which represented sales of pcs for use in the home 
however  many analysts predict that future growth may be at a moderately slower rate than the rate experienced in recent years 
sales of tape drives and tape drive related products  although a less significant component of sales for the company than sales of disk drive products  have tended to be more stable 
the company has experienced longer product cycles for its tape drives and tape drive related products  compared with the short product cycles of disk drive products 
however  there is no assurance that this trend will continue 
the company could experience decreases in demand for its products in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the hard disk drive industry has also been subject  from time to time  to seasonal fluctuations in demand 
the company has typically experienced relatively flat demand in the quarter ending september compared with the quarter ending june  and increasing demand throughout the quarters ending december and march the company s shipments tend to be highest in the third month of each quarter  and failure by the company to complete shipments in the final month could adversely affect the company s operating results for that quarter 
intellectual property matters 
from time to time  the company is approached by companies and individuals alleging quantum s need for a license under patented technology that quantum assertedly uses 
if required  there can be no assurance that licenses to any such technology could be obtained or obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
adverse resolution of any intellectual property litigation could subject the company to substantial liabilities and require it to refrain from manufacturing certain products 
in addition  the costs of engaging in such litigation may be substantial  regardless of the outcome 
trends and uncertainties more specific to quantum there are certain trends and uncertainties that relate more specifically to quantum and are not necessarily indicative of the information storage industry as a whole 
these trends and uncertainties include dependence on mke for the manufacture of the disk drives that quantum develops and markets  costs associated with the mr recording head development and manufacture  the recently announced recording heads joint venture with mke  dependence on suppliers  component shortages  future capital needs  warranty costs  foreign manufacturing  and price volatility of quantum common stock 
for information regarding litigation refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
dependence on mke relationship 
quantum is dependent on mke for the manufacture of its disk drive products 
approximately of the company s fiscal sales were derived from products manufactured by mke 
the transition of the manufacturing of the company s high capacity products to mke in fiscal has resulted in an increased dependence on mke 
the company s relationship with mke is therefore critical to the company s business and financial performance 
the company s dependence on mke entails  among others  the following principal risks quality and delivery 
the company relies on mke s ability to bring new products rapidly to volume production at low cost  to meet the company s stringent quality requirements  and to respond quickly to changing product delivery schedules from the company 
this requires  among other things  close and continuous collaboration between the company and mke in all phases of design  engineering  and production 
the company s business and financial results would be adversely affected if products manufactured by mke fail to satisfy the company s quality requirements or if mke is unable to meet the company s delivery commitments 
in the event mke is unable to satisfy quantum s production requirements  the company would not have an alternative manufacturing source to meet the demand without substantial delay and disruption of the company s operations 
as a result  the company would be materially adversely affected 
volume and pricing 
mke s production schedule is based on the company s forecasts of its product purchase requirements  and the company has only limited rights to modify short term purchase orders issued to mke 
further  the demand in the desktop business is inherently volatile  and there is no assurance that the company s forecasts are accurate 
in addition  the company periodically negotiates pricing arrangements with mke 
the failure of the company to accurately forecast its requirements  which could lead to inventory shortages or surpluses  or the failure to reach pricing agreements reasonable to the company would have a material adverse effect on the company 
manufacturing capacity and capital commitment 
the company believes that mke s current and committed manufacturing capacity should be adequate to meet the company s requirements at least through the end of fiscal the company s future growth will require  however  that mke continue to devote substantial financial resources to property  plant and equipment and working capital to support manufacture of the company s products  as to which there can be no assurance 
in the event that mke is unable or unwilling to meet the company s manufacturing requirements  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain an alternate source of supply 
any such failure to obtain an alternative source would have a material adverse effect on the company 
mr recording heads development and manufacturing 
since the fiscal acquisition of mr recording heads technology as part of the acquisition of certain businesses of the storage business unit of digital equipment corporation  quantum has made significant efforts to advance the development of its mr recording heads capability 
the company believes that mr head technology  which enables higher capacity per disk than conventional thin film inductive heads  will replace inductive heads as the leading recording head technology 
although the company currently obtains the majority of its mr heads from outside sources  the company believes that by manufacturing mr heads it has developed in depth knowledge of mr head technology 
this knowledge is leveraged in the research  development  and production of disk drive products that utilize mr head technology 
in addition  the company believes that having a captive supply of mr heads lowers the risk of mr head supply shortages that may occur in the future as a result of increased requirements for disk drive products that utilize mr recording heads 
however  mr technology is relatively complex and  to date  the company s manufacturing yields for its mr heads have been lower than would be necessary for cost effective production of mr recording heads 
as discussed in the strategic development section  mke and quantum agreed to form a joint venture to partner in the research  development  and production of mr heads and technology 
quantum believes that through mke s manufacturing expertise  the potential of the mr heads operations will be realized to the benefit of both mke and quantum 
however  cost effective production of mr recording heads is not expected to be realized until late fiscal at the earliest 
until that time  the company will incur losses based on its pro rata ownership interest in the new joint venture 
however  there can be no assurance that the benefits of the joint venture will be realized on a timely basis or at all 
there is an additional uncertainty associated with maintaining or increasing the supply of mr recording heads used in the manufacture of disk drives 
there are limited alternative sources of supply for mr recording heads 
in the event that current sources of mr recording heads  which include quantum s mr heads operations that will become part of the joint venture  do not meet disk drive production requirements  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to locate and obtain adequate supplies from alternative sources 
a shortage of mr recording heads would materially adversely affect the company 
dependence on suppliers of components and sub assemblies  component shortages 
the company and its manufacturing partner  mke  are dependent on qualified suppliers for components and sub assemblies  including recording heads  media  and integrated circuits  which are essential to the manufacture of the company s products 
in connection with certain products  the company and mke qualify only a single source for certain components and sub assemblies  which can magnify the risk of shortages 
component shortages have constrained the company s sales growth in the past  and the company believes that the industry will periodically experience component shortages 
if such shortages occur  or if the company experiences quality problems with component suppliers  shipments of products could be significantly delayed or costs significantly increased  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
future capital needs 
the information storage business is capital intensive 
although the company expects long term capital requirements related to its involvement in the development and manufacture of mr recording heads to decline as a result of the announced joint venture with mke  the company believes that it will need significant additional financial resources over the next several years for capital expenditures  working capital  and research and development  in order to remain competitive in the information storage business 
the company believes that it will be able to fund these capital requirements at least through fiscal however  if the company decides to increase its capital expenditures further or sooner than presently contemplated  or if results of operations do not meet the company s expectations  the company will require additional debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional funds will be available to the company or will be available on favorable terms 
the company may also require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated 
if the company is unable to obtain sufficient capital  it could be required to curtail its capital equipment and research and development expenditures  which could adversely affect the company 
warranty 
quantum generally warrants its products against defects for a period of one to five years 
a provision for estimated future costs relating to warranty expense is recorded when products are shipped 
the actual warranty expenditures could have a material unfavorable impact on the company if the actual rate of unit failure or the cost to repair a unit is greater than what the company has used in estimating the warranty expense accrual 
risks associated with foreign manufacturing 
many of the company s products are currently manufactured outside the united states 
as a result  the company is subject to certain risks associated with contracting with foreign manufacturers  including obtaining requisite united states and foreign governmental permits and approvals  currency exchange fluctuations  currency restrictions  political instability  labor problems  trade restrictions  and changes in tariff and freight rates 
foreign exchange contracts 
the company manages the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on certain foreign currency receivables and payables using foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
with this approach the company expects to minimize the impact of changing foreign exchange rates on the company s net income 
however  there can be no assurance that all foreign currency exposures will be adequately managed  and the company could incur material charges as a result of changing foreign exchange rates 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
factors such as new product announcements by the company or its competitors  quarterly fluctuations in the operating results of the company  its competitors  and other technology companies  and general conditions in the computer market may have a significant impact on the market price of the common stock 
in particular  if the company were to report operating results that did not meet the expectations of the analysts  the market price of the common stock could be materially adversely affected
