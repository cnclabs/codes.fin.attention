overview mariner s net patient service revenue is derived primarily from providing inpatient health care services to subacute patients  rehabilitation programs in skilled nursing facilities  outpatient rehabilitation services in freestanding clinics and other post acute medical services 
the growth in mariner s net patient service revenue and operating profitability depends on two principal factors i the shift by the company toward treatment of short stay  medically demanding subaccute patients and away from less medically demanding patients  and ii the addition of a variety of alternate sites and expansion of post acute health care services 
subacute patients typically require three to six hours of skilled nursing care per day  in contrast to the more than six hours of skilled nursing care per day required by acute care hospital patients and the less than two hours of custodial nursing care per day required by traditional nursing home residents 
these subacute patients typically are recuperating from a major injury  surgery or illness and  after a relatively short transition period  generally are discharged to their homes 
the company s clinical programs  including marinercare programs  have been designed for these patients 
during  as a result of the csi merger  the florida acquisition  the allegis acquisiton and other inpatient facility acquisitions  the company added facilities with a total of  beds 
since these acquisitions  the company has been focusing these facilities increasingly on treating medically demanding subaccute patients 
with the existing patient populations acquired with these facilities  mariner currently expects that a significant length of time may be required before such patient population changes sufficiently to require a level of care  and to have a length of stay  comparable to that experienced in the company s other facilities 
as a result  the addition of these facilities adversely affected the company s operating profitability and overall operating statistics 
see patient focus and site expansion 
patient focus 
mariner believes that short length of patient stay and high bed turnover maximize net patient service revenue and operating margins 
as compared to less medically demanding patients  short stay subacute patients generally require more intense skilled nursing care and more rehabilitation  pharmacy and other ancillary medical services 
the median length of stay for patients discharged in the applicable period from facilities owned or leased by the company during the applicable period increased from days in to days in the bed turnover rate for the inpatient facilities owned or leased by the company during the applicable period has deceased from times in to times in the increase in median length of stay and decease in bed turnover rate from to resulted principally from the acquisition of facilities in newly acquired facilities generally contain an existing patient population  and consequently a significant length of time may be required before such patient population changes sufficiently to require a level of care  and to have a length of stay  comparable to that experienced in the company s existing facilities 
in the facilities the company acquires  the company intends to focus on treating subacute patients and implementing appropriate marinercare programs or other clinical programs 
the company s focus on short stay subacute patients has historically provided the company with an attractive payor mix 
short stay medical care is covered by a wider range of payors  including indemnity insurers  health maintenance organizations  employers  medicare and medicaid  while long term more than days medical care typically is covered by medicaid 
percentage of revenue generated from medicare and private payors decreased from in to in the decrease in payor mix from to resulted principally from the result of the acquisition of additional new facilities in which were more heavily dependent on medicaid reimbursment 
by continuing to emphasize short stay subacute patients  mariner has historically increased the percentage of its revenue generated from medicare and private payors including indemnity insurers  health maintenance organizations  employers and individuals in newly acquired facilities 
even among the company s patients for whom medicaid is the primary payor  mariner has focused increasingly on treating those patients with substantial medical problems who require three or more hours of skilled nursing care per day 
typically  mariner is reimbursed by medicaid at substantially higher rates for these patients than for less medically demanding custodial care patients 
the net patient service revenue generated by the company s medicaid patients decreased from  per bed in to  per bed in this decrease was primarily due to the geographic shift in the percentage of revenues derived from florida and texas which have lower medicaid rates than the northeast or midwest regions 
the company s rehabilitation programs have also focused on subacute patients in skilled nursing facilities who require intensive rehabilitation therapy over a short period 
the number of rehabilitation programs with skilled nursing facilities has decreased from as of december  to as of december  despite this decrease in programs  revenue from private payors and reimbursement under medicare have increased as a percentage of total revenue from these programs 
in addition  the company has expanded the range of post acute health care services it provides directly in selected local markets in an effort to treat patients throughout their recovery 
as a result  the company receives revenues from these services both during a patient s inpatient stay and after discharge 
as a result of these trends  mariner s average revenue per occupied bed per year decreased from  in to  in revenue per rehabilitation program increased from  in to  in these trends are illustrated in the following table years ended december  inpatient operations licensed beds    average occupancy rates median length of stay days days days bed turnover rate x x x revenue per occupied bed per year private payors and medicare    medicaid    company as a whole    percentage of average daily census private payors and medicare medicaid rehabilitation operations revenue per rehabilitation program per    year outpatient clinic visits per year    payor mix company revenue as a whole private payors and medicare medicaid facilities owned and leased as of the end of the applicable period 
based on those patients who were discharged during the applicable period from facilities owned or leased by mariner 
represents total discharges divided by average number of licensed beds during the applicable period 
represents applicable net patient service revenue divided by the average daily census of patients generating such revenue 
private payors includes indemnity insurers  health maintenance organizations  employers  individuals and other non governmental payors  and for payor mix  payments from skilled nursing facilities for services performed under rehabilitation management programs and revenue classified as other income 
represents aggregate revenue from rehabilitation programs with skilled nursing facilities during the applicable period divided by the average number of such programs as of the end of the applicable period 
site expansion 
mariner has expanded by acquiring  leasing and developing freestanding inpatient facilities  by entering into arrangements to manage hospital based subacute units and to provide rehabilitation programs and by expanding the other post acute health care services it provides 
the company s site expansion is illustrated in the following table december  sites of service owned and leased freestanding inpatient facilities managed freestanding inpatient facilities and hospital based units rehabilitation programs with skilled nursing facilities outpatient rehabilitation clinics includes skilled nursing facilities and one rehabilitation hospital with an aggregate of  beds which became owned or leased by the company on january  upon completion of the csi merger 
mariner acquires established skilled nursing facilities and converts them into facilities focusing increasingly on treating medically demanding subacute patients 
historically  net patient revenue and operating margins from acquired inpatient facilities have increased gradually over a period of years as marinercare programs are implemented  and  as intensity of care and ancillary service requirements increase  length of patient stay decreases and payor mix improves 
an acquired facility may contain an existing patient population  and consequently a significant length of time may be required before such patient population changes sufficiently to require a level of care  and to have alength of stay  comparable to that experienced in the company s existing facilities 
during this conversion period  mariner would generally expect to realize lower revenue for these existing patients than could otherwise be obtained for new patients 
facilities undergoing conversion are expected to continue to generate increased net patient service revenue and operating margins as they continue to emphasize short stay subacute patients 
mariner also develops new freestanding inpatient facilities and renovates acute care hospitals which are dedicated primarily to providing marinercare programs and other services to subacute patients 
net patient service revenue and operating margins typically increase gradually at newly opened facilities  which have low initial occupancy rates 
because newly opened facilities require a basic complement of staff on the day it opens regardless of patient census  these facilities initially generate significant losses 
as patient census increases at a facility  margins improve  regardless of whether the patients are subacute or medically less demanding 
margins typically increase at newly opened facilities as patient and payor mix improve and ancillary service use increases 
these facilities generally have taken six to nine months before their revenues have been sufficient to cover their operating costs  and nine to fifteen months before they have contributed positively to the company s net earnings 
leased units have substantially the same operating characteristics as newly opened facilities with less significant financing costs 
managed freestanding inpatient facilities and hospital based managed subacute care units typically provide significantly higher profit margins with substantially lower revenue than the company s owned and leased facilities because the host facility generally bears the related operating and capital expenses while paying the company a management fee 
unlike freestanding inpatient facilities owned or leased by the company  managed facilities and units typically do not require significant start up costs or capital outlays by the company 
the company incurs start up expenses for new rehabilitation programs as therapists are hired and necessary equipment is acquired 
these programs and clinics typically become profitable within six months of opening and generate positive cash flow in to months 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of total operating revenue for the three years ended december   and  and the percentage changes in the dollar amounts of revenue and expenses for as compared to  and as compared to percent of revenue percentage increase decrease year ended december  over over revenues net patient service revenue other revenue total operating revenue operating and administrative expenses facility operating costs corporate general administrative interest expense  net facility rent expense  net depreciation and amortization total operating expenses includes a charge of  in related to additional reserves on medicare receivables

total operating revenue increased from  in to  in and to  in net patient service revenue increased by  or  from to and by  or  from to the increase from to resulted primarily from the inclusion of revenue generated from the facilities and businesses acquired during  as well as the inclusion of a full year of revenue from the eight facilities acquired during the increase in was due primarily to the inclusion of all revenue from the csi facilities that were acquired on january   the eight facilities acquired or leased in the florida acquisition and eight facilities acquired or leased from allegis  as well as inclusion of a full year of revenue from facilities and businesses acquired in the company also experienced increases in the use of ancillary medical services at its inpatient facilities 
the revenue increases in each of and were partially offset by reductions due to the cancellation or non renewal of contracts for certain rehabilitation programs 
other revenue includes fees earned from contracts to manage inpatient subacute care units within selected health care facilities and in  included fees of  relating to the management of certain csi facilities 
the reduction in other revenue from to resulted primarily from the termination of the management agreements with certain of the csi facilities  which were acquired on january  see business significant developments in transactions with convalescent services  inc appearing in item to this report 
facility operating costs 
facility operating costs consist primarily of employee salaries  wages and benefits  food  ancillary supplies  pharmacy supplies  plant operations  and  in  costs related to a significant change in the business focus at the company s baltimore facility 
most clinical staff and rehabilitation therapists are paid an hourly wage 
salaries  wages and benefits as a percentage of revenue are higher at newly opened inpatient facilities  which require a basic compliment of staff on the day the facility opens regardless of the patient census  than at pre existing inpatient facilities 
as the patient census increases and patient mix improves at its inpatient facilities  mariner has experienced decreases in these costs as a percentage of revenue at such facilities 
various other types of operating expenses  including medical supplies  pharmacy supplies  nutritional support services and expenses associated with the provision of ancillary services  vary more directly with patient census  as well as with general rates of inflation 
facility operating costs increased from  in to  in and to  in these increases were principally the result of adding new facilities  providing more ancillary medical services and adding therapists and aides to service new rehabilitation programs 
in addition  these costs included  related to a significant change in focus at the company s baltimore facilities in as a percentage of total operating revenue  these costs decreased from in to in and in corporate general and administrative 
corporate general and administration expenses include the expenses of the company s corporate office  which provides marketing  financial and management services 
these expenses increased from  in to  in and to  in the increases were  in part  a result of additional personnel required to support the facilities acquired during  and during  the company recorded a charge of  of which  related to the merger with pinnacle care corporation  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and  related to the accelerated vesting of certain stock options 
of the merger costs  approximately  was for employee severance  payroll and relocation   was incurred for transaction costs including investment bankers  legal and accounting fees   for customer relations   for operations relocation   for investor relations and  for employee relations

of the charge related to the medrehab merger  approximately  was for employee severance  payroll and relocation   for transaction costs   to write off abandoned property and software   for relocation of operations   for customer relations and  for employee relations 
as a percentage of total operating revenue  corporate general and administrative expenses were in  in and in interest expense  net 
net interest expense increased from  in to  in and to  in the increases were due to additional borrowings which were primarily used to fund acquisitions 
facility rent expense  net 
net rent expense increased from  in to  in  and  in the increases resulted from the lease costs associated with new leases entered in connection with certain acquisitions during depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from  in to  in  and to  in  principally as a result of the increase in the number of facilities as a result of acquisition activities  the opening of new facilities and businesses  and the completion of facility renovations 
provision for income taxes 
during  mariner s tax rate reflects the reversal of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets 
the company believes that it will be able to take advantage of these assets before they expire and has reflected this in its tax rate in the company currently expects the effective tax rate to increase from to in due  primarily  to the effect of non deductible goodwill associated with certain acquisitions 
extraordinary items 
in mariner incurred  of extraordinary losses  net of income tax benefit  related to early repayment of mortgage obligations

mariner has a  senior secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks the credit facility 
as of december  and  principal balances outstanding under the credit facility were approximately  and  respectively  and letters of credit outstanding under this facility were  and  respectively 
mariner has used  and intends to continue to use  borrowings under the credit facility to finance the acquisition and development of additional subacute care facilities and related businesses  and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
mariner s obligations under the credit facility are collateralized by a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries and are guaranteed by all of the company s subsidiaries 
in addition  the credit facility is secured by mortgages on certain of the company s inpatient facilities  leasehold mortgages on certain inpatient facilities leased by the company  and security interests in certain other properties and assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
the credit facility matures on april  and provides for prime or libor based interest rate options 
the borrowing availability and rate of interest varies depending upon specified financial ratios 
the credit facility also contains covenants which  among other things  require the company to maintain certain financial ratios and impose certain limitations or prohibitions on the company with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness  liens and capital leases  the payment of dividends on  and the redemption or repurchase of  its capital stock  investments and acquisitions  including acquisitions of new facilities  the merger or consolidation of the company with any person or entity and the disposition of any of the company s properties or assets

estimated settlements due from third party payors aggregated  and  at december  and  respectively 
the number of days sales in accounts receivable and estimated settlements due from third party payors was approximately days at december  and days at december  the decrease was primarily due to i the acquisition of receivables in the allegis aquisition and ii the  increased reserve for potential lower levels of medicare reinbursement 
the decrease also resulted from improved collections and the completion of centralization of the billing functions 
in january  mariner completed the csi merger and its acquisition of certain related assets 
in the merger  all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of csi were converted into the right to receive an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock and  in cash

the options are exercisable during specified periods between and the aggregate estimated fair market value as of the earliest exercise date of the options  and the aggregate purchase price for  the facilities subject to the options is approximately  which includes a deposit of  already paid by the company 
mariner financed the cash consideration payable in these transactions with borrowings under the credit facility 
on march   the company completed the medrehab merger 
mariner issued an aggregate of approximately  shares of its common stock for all of medrehab s outstanding capital stock and options to purchase medrehab capital stock in a merger that is being accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in addition  the company prepaid an aggregate principal amount of approximately  of medrehab s outstanding indebtedness at the closing of the medrehab merger 
the company repaid this indebtedness with funds it borrowed under the credit facility 
certain former medrehab stockholders exercised the right to require the company to repurchase their shares of mariner common stock for approximately  in march  mariner acquired a primary care physician organization in the orlando  florida area 
in this transaction  mariner issued an aggregate of  shares of its common stock and paid an aggregate of  in cash which was financed under the credit facility 
in may  the company completed the florida acquisition which involved seven skilled nursing facilities and one assisted living facility with an aggregate of beds in florida  tennessee and kansas 
all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock were converted into the right to receive an aggregate of approximately  in cash 
the company financed the consideration paid in the florida acquisition with a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes and borrowings under the credit facility 
on october   the company acquired a bed facility in jacksonville  florida 
the total purchase price was  mariner funded the purchase price by assuming two hud mortgages in the aggregate principal amount of approximately  the company borrowed  under its credit facility to fund the remainder of the cash portion of the purchase price and to replace reserves required by the hud mortgage agreements 
in a two part closing consummated on october  and november   mariner acquired certain assets of allegis and certain of its affiliates 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the company purchased five inpatient facilities  assumed two operating leases and one capital lease and purchased allegis institutional pharmacy and its rehabilitation program management subsidiary 
the total purchase price of  consisted of the assumption of  in debt  including the capital lease  and  in cash

from january  through march   the company also borrowed approximately  under the credit facility primarily to fund working capital requirements 
the company intends to expand its clinical programs in strategically selected metropolitan areas throughout the united states 
the company also intends to expand its pharmacy  home health care and outpatient rehabilitation services 
in addition to acquiring individual facilities  mariner may acquire businesses that operate multiple facilities or ancillary health care services businesses 
the company continuously identifies and evaluates potential acquisition candidates and in many cases engages in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s discussions or negotiations will result in an acquisition 
further  if the company makes any acquisitions  there can be no assurance that it will be able to operate any acquired facilities or businesses profitably or otherwise successfully implement its expansion strategy 
mariner currently has no agreements with respect to any acquisition 
the company s capital expenditures for the years ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively 
the company has currently budgeted approximately  for capital expenditures during the company s currently planned capital expenditures include approximately  for upgrading the company s information systems  approximately  for expansion of existing facilities  as well as the costs of maintaining the company s inpatient facilities and offices and approximately  for the construction of three new inpatient sites 
the company currently estimates that it spends approximately per bed per year for maintenance of its inpatient facilities 
mariner believes that its future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors  including cash generated from operations and the rate at which it acquires additional inpatient facilities or other health care services businesses and the rate at which it adds rehabilitation programs 
mariner expects to fund such capital expenditures with borrowings under its credit facility and cash from operations 
mariner currently believes that the cash from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet its needs through at least december  recently issued pronouncements during  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb statement no 
 earnings per share 
this standard is designed to impove the earnings per share eps information provided in financial statements by simplifying the existing computational guidelines  revising the disclosure requirements  and increasing the comparability of eps data on an international basis 
the company will implement the new standard in its fiscal year ending december  the impact of the implementation of this standard has not yet been determined 
impact of inflation the health care industry is labor intensive 
wages and other labor costs are especially sensitive to inflation 
increases in wages and other labor costs as a result of inflation  or increases in federal or state minimum wages without a corresponding increase in medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates  could adversely impact the company 
risk factors except for the historical information contained herein  the matters contained in this report include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on reimbursement by third party payors mariner derives a significant portion of its revenue from the medicaid and medicare programs 
in the years ended december   and  the company derived   and respectively  of its revenue from medicaid programs and   and  respectively  of its revenues from the medicare program 
these programs are subject to retroactive rate adjustments  administrative rulings and government funding restrictions  all of which may decrease the level of program reimbursements to the company 
funds received by the company from the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to audit which can result in the company having to refund overpayments 
in addition  there can be no assurance that facilities owned  leased or managed by mariner now or in the future that participate in the medicare and medicaid programs will initially meet or continue to meet the requirements for participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
legislation and regulations have been proposed on the federal and state levels that would have the effect of materially limiting or reducing reimbursement levels for the company s programs and services 
mariner cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  the effect if any such proposals will have on the company 
furthermore  the company has observed a nationwide change in the practices of its medicare fiscal intermediaries which  on behalf of hcfa  the federal agency responsible for administering the medicare program  have begun to aggressively and retrospectively change their position on previously approved costs 
this change includes the reclassification of costs from reimbursable to non reimbursable and the challenging of payment for costs which had traditionally been approved 
in response to these challenges of the payment of medicare costs on an industry wide basis  the company has provided additional reserve amounts for potential lower levels of medicare reimbursement 
in addition  mariner provides certain services between subsidiary companies  some of which are charged at cost and others of whch are charged at market rates 
mariner believes that the services which are charged at market rates qualify for an exception to medicare s related party rule 
there can be no assurance  however  that hcfa will endorse mariner s position and the medicare reimbursement received for such services may be subject to audit and recoupment in future years 
in april  hcfa issued a memorandum to its medicare fiscal intermediaries as a guideline to assess costs incurred by inpatient providers relating to payment of occupational and speech language pathology services furnished under arrangements that include contracts between therapy providers and inpatient providers 
while not binding on the fiscal intermediaries  the memorandum suggested certain rates to assist the fiscal intermediaries in making annual prudent buyer assessments of speech and occupational therapy rates paid by inpatient providers 
in addition  hcfa is in the process of promulgating new salary equivalency guidelines which will update current physical therapy and respiratory therapy rates and establish new guidelines for occupational therapy and speech therapy 
mariner will not be able to determine whether these new proposals will have a material effect on its rehabilitation operations until the publication of final rates and rules 
hcfa through its intermediaries is subjecting physical therapy  occupational therapy and speech therapy to a heightened level of scrutiny resulting in increasing audit activity 
a majority of mariner s provider and rehabilitation contracts provide for indemnification of the facilities for potential liabilities in connection with rehabilitation services 
the company s gross margins for its physical therapy services under medicare s salary equivalency guidelines are significantly less than for its speech and occupational therapy services which are currently reimbursed by medicare under the prudent buyer standard 
there can be no assurance that actions ultimately taken by hcfa with regard to reimbursement rates for such therapy services will not materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
see business sources of revenue in item of this report 
in addition to reducing revenue from federal and state payors  the imposition of more stringent reimbursement guidelines or a decrease in the level of medicare or medicaid reimbursement for these services could adversely affect the ability of skilled nursing facilities or other health care providers that depend on medicare or medicaid reimbursement to pay the company for rehabilitation program services and may cause such facilities to reduce the rates that they are willing to pay the company for such services 
any significant decrease in medicare or medicaid reimbursement levels  or the imposition of significant restrictions on participation in medicare or medicaid programs  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
certain states in which mariner operates have undertaken a study of acuity levels and are considering changes in their reimbursement systems to take levels of acuity into account 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the rates paid to mariner by medicare  medicaid  private payors or by skilled nursing facilities under rehabilitation programs will continue to be adequate to reimburse the company for the costs of providing services to covered beneficiaries 
mariner has also agreed under certain of its contracts with private payors and intends to continue to agree as part of its business strategy to provide certain health care services to covered patients on a case rate or capitated basis 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of this report and business sources of revenue in item of this report 
fluctuation of quarterly results of operations the company s operating revenue and net income generally fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the fluctuation is related to several factors including the timing of medicaid rate increases  changes in the level of medicare reimbursement  the timing of acquisitions in operating results of acquired facilities  overall census  payor mix  acuity levels  seasonal census cycles and the number of working days in a given quarter 
in addition  a significant amount of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  if projected revenues are not realized in the expected period  the company s operating results for that period could be adversely affected 
such quarterly fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
health care reform current political  economic and regulatory influences are likely to lead to fundamental changes in the health care industry in the united states 
numerous proposals for comprehensive reform of the nation s health care system have been introduced over the past few years in congress 
many potential approaches are under consideration  including controls on health care spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and medicare and medicaid spending and other fundamental changes to the health care delivery system 
in addition  some of the states in which the company operates are considering or have adopted various health care reform proposals and are considering reductions in their state medicaid budgets 
mariner anticipates that congress and state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies and that public debate of these issues will likely continue in the future 
due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation  the company cannot predict which  if any  of such reform proposals will be adopted  when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on the company 
in addition  the cost and service considerations which have generated proposals for health care reform have also resulted in  and are expected to continue to result in  strategic realignments and combinations in the health care industry which may  over time  have a significant impact on the company s strategic direction and operating results 
there can be no assurance that future legislation  health care or budgetary  or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental health care programs will not materially adversely affect the results of operations of mariner 
concern about the potential effects of the proposed reform measures have contributed to the volatility of prices in securities of companies in health care and related industries  including the company  and may similarly affect the price of the company s common stock in the future 
included in president clinton s budget proposals are significant changes to the medicare payment system 
proposals that are under active consideration include  prospective payment for both home care and skilled nursing facilities  and bundling of post acute care services 
these  and other proposals which are being considered  could have a significant effect on payments to the entire healthcare industry  including mariner 
each of the legislative proposals offered by the president provides for significant reductions in the overall rate of medicare and medicaid spending growth 
these proposals are subject to approval and amendment by congress  and the company cannot predict their impact on the company or its operations at this time 
there is active discussion concerning the foregoing and balancing of the federal and state budgets  and the form of any final legislation enacted could differ significantly from current proposals 
aspects of certain of the health care proposals  such as reductions in funding of the medicare and medicaid programs  potential changes in reimbursement regulations by hcfa for contract therapy services  containment of health care costs  proposals to reimburse health care providers on a basis not linked to costs on an interim basis that could include a short term freeze on prices charged by health care providers and greater state flexibility in the administration of medicaid  could materially adversely affect the company 
uncertainty of regulation the company and the health care industry generally are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation governing licensure and conduct of operations at existing facilities  construction of new facilities  acquisition of existing facilities  addition of new services  certain capital expenditures  reimbursement for services rendered and disposal of medical waste 
changes in applicable laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on licensure  eligibility for participation  permissible activities  operating costs and the levels of reimbursement from governmental and other sources 
there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not adopt changes or new interpretations of existing regulations that could adversely affect the company 
the failure to maintain or renew any required regulatory approvals or licenses could prevent the company from offering existing services or from obtaining reimbursement 
in certain circumstances  failure to comply at one facility may affect the ability of the company to obtain or maintain licenses or approvals under medicare and medicaid programs at other facilities 
recently effective provisions of the regulations adopted under the omnibus budget reconciliation act of obra  as amended  have expanded remedies available to hcfa to enforce compliance with the detailed regulations mandating minimum health care standards and may significantly affect the consequences to the company if annual or other hcfa facility surveys identify noncompliance with these regulations 
remedies include fines  new patient admission moratoriums  denial of reimbursement  federal or state monitoring of operations  closure of facilities and termination of provider reimbursement agreements 
in the ordinary course of its business  the company receives notices from time to time of deficiencies for failure to comply with various regulatory requirements 
although the company reviews such notices and takes appropriate corrective action  there can be no assurance that the company s facilities will be able to remedy the deficiencies in all situations or remain continuously in compliance with regulatory requirements 
adverse actions against a facility by applicable regulatory agencies may adversely affect the facility s ability to continue to operate  the ability of the company to provide certain services  and the facility s eligibility to participate in the medicare or medicaid programs 
these actions may adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
the company is also subject to federal and state laws which govern financial and other arrangements between health care providers 
these laws often prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between health care providers  including physicians  that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to  or the recommendation of  a particular provider for medical products and services 
these laws include the federal stark legislations which prohibit any remuneration for physician referrals  and  with limited exceptions  physician ownership of ancillary service providers and the federal antikickback law which prohibits  among other things  the offer  payment  solicitation  or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of medicare and medicaid patients 
the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services  the department of justice and other federal agencies interpret these fraud and abuse provisions liberally and enforce them aggressively 
recently federal laws and initiatives  including the kennedy kassebaum act and operation restore trust  have significantly expanded the federal government s involvement in curtailing fraud and abuse and increased the monetary penalties for violation of these provisions 
in addition  some states restrict certain business relationships between physicians and other providers of health care services 
many states prohibit business corporations from providing  or holding themselves out as a provider of  medical care 
possible sanctions for violation of any of these restrictions or prohibitions include loss of licensure or eligibility to participate in reimbursement programs including medicare and medicaid  asset forfeitures and civil and criminal penalties including monetary penalties 
these laws vary from state to state  are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies 
from time to time  the company has sought guidance as to the interpretation of these laws  however  there can be no assurance that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with the practices of the company 
many states have adopted certificate of need or similar laws which generally require that the appropriate state agency approve certain acquisitions or capital expenditures in excess of defined levels and determine that a need exists for certain new bed additions  new services  and the acquisition of such medical equipment or capital expenditures or other changes prior to beds and or services being added 
many states have placed a moratorium on granting additional certificates of need or otherwise stated their intent not to grant approval for new beds 
to the extent certificates of need or other similar approvals are required for expansion of company operations  either through facility acquisitions or expansion or provision of new services or other changes  such expansion could be adversely affected by the failure or inability to obtain the necessary approvals  changes in the standards applicable to such approvals and possible delays associated with the expenses of obtaining such approvals 
the company s pharmacy business is also subject to inspection by state agencies regarding record keeping  inventory control and other aspects of the pharmacy business 
the company is unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local regulation or legislation  including medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations 
further changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company s operations 
difficulty of integrating recent acquisitions  management of growth the successful integration of the businesses mariner acquires is important to the company s future performance 
the anticipated benefits from any of these acquisitions may not be achieved unless the operations of the acquired businesses are successfully combined with those of the company in a timely manner 
the integration of the company s recent and proposed acquisitions will require substantial attention from management 
the diversion of the attention of management  and any difficulties encountered in the transition process  could have a material adverse effect on mariner s revenue and operating results 
in addition  the process of integrating the various businesses could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of some or all of these businesses  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial results 
there can be no assurance that mariner will realize any of the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions 
the company s growth has placed a significant burden on the company s management  operating personnel  financial and operating systems 
the company s ability to manage its growth effectively and assimilate the operations of acquired facilities or businesses  or newly expanded or developed facilities  will require it to continue to attract  train  motivate  manage and retain key employees and to expand its operational and financial systems 
if the company is unable to manage its growth effectively  it could be materially adversely affected 
expansion risks and impact on future operating results mariner s strategy includes expanding by establishing or acquiring additional freestanding subacute care facilities  managing subacute care units within general acute care hospitals and acquiring ancillary health care services businesses 
as part of its strategy  the company may acquire businesses that operate one or more freestanding inpatient facilities or rehabilitation  pharmacy  home care  medical equipment and other health care businesses 
there is significant competition for acquisition and expansion opportunities in the company s businesses 
as this competition intensifies due to ongoing consolidation in the health care industry  the costs of capitalizing on such opportunities may increase 
mariner competes for acquisition and expansion opportunities with companies that have significantly greater financial and management resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully for these opportunities  operate the acquired businesses profitably or otherwise implement successfully its expansion strategy 
mariner s expansion will depend on its ability to create demand in new markets for its clinical programs and to staff new facilities and rehabilitation programs  as well as on the availability of facilities and businesses for acquisition or management 
such expansion and growth place significant demands on the company s financial and management resources 
if mariner is unable to manage its growth effectively  the quality of its services  its ability to recruit and retain key personnel and its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of this report 
an acquired facility may contain an existing patient population and  consequently  a significant length of time may be required before such patient population changes sufficiently to require a level of care  and to have a length of stay  comparable to that provided in the company s existing facilities 
during this conversion period  mariner would generally expect to realize lower reimbursement rates for these existing patients than could otherwise be obtained for new patients 
if the company acquires a business that operates multiple facilities  the time required to convert the acquired facilities may be longer than that required to convert individual facilities 
as a result  the expected lower reimbursement rates could persist for a longer period  having a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
further  the effort required to make such newly acquired facilities more comparable to the company s existing facilities may place significant demands on mariner s financial and management resources 
the company may also open new freestanding inpatient facilities  which typically have low initial occupancy rates 
because newly opened facilities require a basic complement of staff on the day the facility opens regardless of the patient census  these facilities initially generate significant operating losses 
as a result of these factors  as well as expansion into new markets and the addition of ancillary services  mariner could experience significant fluctuations in operating results

leverage as of december   the company had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness not including debt under operating leases  which represented of its total capitalization 
in addition  the company had million of availability under the credit facility 
in  the company requested that its lenders increase the size of the credit facility to million  extend the maturity of the credit facility and further reduce the restrictions which the credit facility imposes on the operations of the company s business 
this request was approved by the lenders 
although the company s cash flow from operations has been sufficient to meet its debt service obligations in the past  there can be no assurance that the company s operating results will continue to be sufficient for the company to meet its obligations 
the company s ability to comply with the terms of the notes and the credit facility  to make cash payments with respect to the notes and under the credit facility and to satisfy its other debt or to refinance any of such obligations will depend on the future performance of the company  which in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial and other factors beyond its control 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could have important consequences to the holders of the company s securities  including the following i the company s ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital or general corporate purposes may be impaired in the future  ii a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on the notes and borrowings under the credit facility and other indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available to the company for its operations and other purposes  iii certain of the company s borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which exposes the company to the risk of increased interest rates  and iv the company may be substantially more leveraged than certain of its competitors  which may place the company at a relative competitive disadvantage and make the company more vulnerable to changing market conditions and regulations 
restrictions imposed by indebtedness the credit facility contains a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  prepay subordinated indebtedness  dispose of certain assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  create liens  make capital expenditures and make certain investments or acquisitions and otherwise restrict corporate activities 
in addition  under the credit facility  the company is required to satisfy specified financial covenants  including total indebtedness to cash flow  total senior indebtedness to cash flow and minimum net worth tests 
the ability of the company to comply with such provisions may be affected by events beyond the company s control 
the breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit facility 
in the event of any such default  depending on the actions taken by the lenders under the credit facility  the company could be prohibited from making any payments on the notes 
in addition  such lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under the credit facility  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable 
the credit facility is secured by the capital stock of the company s subsidiaries and certain other assets of the company s subsidiaries  and if the company were unable to repay borrowings under the credit facility  the lenders under the credit facility the banks could proceed against their collateral 
if the banks or the holders of any other secured indebtedness were to foreclose on the collateral securing the company s obligations to them  it is possible that there would be insufficient assets remaining after satisfaction in full of all such indebtedness to satisfy in full the claims of the holders of the notes 
the indenture subjects the company to certain restrictive covenants  including  among other things  covenants with respect to the following matters i limitation on indebtedness  ii limitation on restricted payments  iii limitation on the incurrence of liens  iv restriction on the issuance of preferred stock of subsidiaries  v limitation on transactions with affiliates  vi limitation on sale of assets  vii limitation on other senior subordinated indebtedness  viii limitation on guarantees by subsidiaries  ix limitation on the creation of any restriction on the ability of the company s subsidiaries to make distributions  and x restriction on mergers  consolidations and the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the company to another person 
in addition  the loan instruments governing the indebtedness of certain of the company s subsidiaries contain certain restrictive covenants which limit the payment of dividends and distributions  and the transfer of assets to  the company and require such subsidiaries to satisfy specific financial covenants

dependence on key personnel  demand for personnel mariner believes that it has benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of its executive officers and members of its management team 
if such executive officers were to leave the company  the company s business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
further  the company s growth strategy is dependent in large part on its ability to attract and retain management  marketing and other personnel at its facilities 
from time to time  there have been shortages in the supply of available registered nurses and various types of therapists 
mariner s ability to provide rehabilitation services is dependent on its ability to recruit and retain licensed therapists 
the company competes with general acute care hospitals  skilled nursing facilities  rehabilitation hospitals  contract rehabilitation companies and other health care providers for the services of physicians  registered nurses  therapists and other professional personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for its business and planned growth 
the loss of a significant number of members of this management team  or the failure to attract or retain the qualified personnel necessary for its business and planned growth  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see business employees and management in item of this report 
competition the health care industry is highly competitive 
mariner competes with general acute care hospitals  skilled nursing facilities  rehabilitation hospitals  contract rehabilitation companies and other health care providers 
many of the company s competitors have underutilized facilities and are expanding into subacute care by converting some of their facilities into subacute units 
in particular  a number of nursing care facilities and acute care hospitals are adding subacute units 
the company s facilities generally operate in communities that are also served by competing facilities  some of which may be newer or offer more programs 
many of these competitors have significantly greater resources than the company and are affiliated with institutions or chains that are larger and have greater access to capital than the company or operate on a non profit or charitable basis 
cost containment efforts  which encourage more efficient utilization of hospital services  have resulted in decreased hospital occupancy in recent years 
these cost containment efforts  as well as the prospect of health care reform  have also caused many health care providers to combine with other health care providers to achieve greater efficiencies and to reduce costs 
the company expects this trend  which may increase competition in its markets  to continue 
see business competition in item of this report 
dependence on contract renewals the company provides rehabilitation program services pursuant to contracts with skilled nursing facilities and other parties 
these contracts are generally for terms of one year and cancelable on to days notice by either party 
the number of rehabilitation contracts with skilled nursing facilities has decreased from as of december  to as of december  in addition  each year a number of contracts have been canceled or not renewed by the company or its clients 
in march  the company completed the medrehab merger  which added physical medicine and rehabilitation services contracts for approximately sites including skilled nursing facilities 
the decision by a significant number of mariner s skilled nursing facility clients to cancel or not renew these contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations

potential volatility of stock price there has been significant volatility in the market prices of securities of health care companies 
mariner believes factors such as legislative and regulatory developments and quarterly variations in financial results could cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of many health care service companies stocks and that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of the company s common stock 
control by significant stockholders as of march  and based on their most recent filings with the commission on schedule d  one stockholder group the former owners of csi reported beneficial ownership representing of the company s common stock 
as a result of such holding and one seat on the board of directors  this stockholder group may have the ability to exert significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to the company s stockholders for approval  including the election of directors 
anti takeover provisions  stockholder rights plan  possible issuance of preferred stock the company s stockholders rights plan and certain provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation and by laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discourage acquisition bids for  the company 
in addition  in the event of a change of control  the credit facility also contains an event of default upon a change of control as defined therein which obligates the company to repay amounts outstanding under the credit facility upon an acceleration of the indebtedness issued thereunder 
further  if a change in control as defined in the indenture should occur  each holder of the notes has the right to require that the company purchase such holder s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of such notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the date of purchase 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock 
in addition  shares of mariner s preferred stock may be issued in the future without further stockholder approval and upon such terms and conditions  having such rights  privileges and preferences  as the board of directors may determine 
the rights of the holders of the company s common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of any holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
mariner has no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock 
the company may also issue additional shares of its common stock in the future without further stockholder approval 
the issuance of preferred stock or additional shares of the company s common stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company 
subordination the notes are senior subordinated obligations of the company and  as such  are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the company  including indebtedness under the credit facility 
the notes rank pari passu with all senior subordinated indebtedness of the company and will rank senior to all other subordinated indebtedness of the company 
the notes will also be effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of the company s subsidaries 
as of march   the aggregate amount of senior indebtedness of the company and indebtedness of the company s subsidiaries excluding intercompany indebtedness that would have effectively ranked senior to the notes would have been approximately million 
in addition  under the indenture  the company would have been permitted to borrow up to an additional million under the credit facility and  provided certain tests are met  will be able to borrow additional senior indebtedness 
in the event of a bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization of the company or in the event that any default in payment of  or the acceleration of  any debt occurs  holders of senior indebtedness of the company will be entitled to payment in full from the proceeds of all assets of the company prior to any payment of such proceeds to holders of the notes 
in addition  the company may not make any principal or interest payments in respect of the notes if any payment default exists with respect to senior indebtedness or any other default on designated senior indebtedness as defined in the indenture occurs and the maturity of such indebtedness is accelerated  or in certain circumstances prior to such acceleration for a specified period of time  unless  in any case  such default has been cured or waived  any such acceleration has been rescinded or such indebtedness has been repaid in full 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient funds remaining after such payments to make payments to the holders of the notes 
holding company structure substantially all of the company s assets are held by its subsidiaries 
as a result  the company s rights  and the rights of its creditors including holders of the notes to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon such subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary s creditors  except to the extent that the company is itself reorganized as a creditor of such subsidiary  in which case the claims of the company would still be subject to the claims of any secured creditor of such subsidiary and of any holder of indebtedness of such subsidiary senior to that held by the company 
as of march  the company s subsidiaries would have had approximately million of indebtedness excluding intercompany indebtedness and indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility which is guaranteed by the company s subsidiaries outstanding 
the notes are obligations exclusively of the company 
the notes will not be guaranteed by any of the company s subsidiaries 
since the operations of the company are currently conducted through subsidiaries  the company s cash flow and its ability to service its debt  including the notes  is dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and distributions to the company 
the subsidiaries are seperate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to pay amounts due pursuant to the notes or to make any funds availible therefor 
in addition  all of the company s subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations of the company under the credit facility 
moreover  the payment of dividends and the making of loan advances to the company by its subsidiaries are contingent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and are subject to various business considerations and  for certain subsidiaries  restrictive loan covenants contained in the instruments governing the indeptedness of such subsidiaries  including covenants which restrict in certain circumstances the payment of dividends and distributions and the transfer of assets to the company
