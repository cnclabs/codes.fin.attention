there were no survivors 
the accident resulted in extensive media coverage calling into question the safety of low fare airlines in general and the company in particular 
in response to the accident  the faa conducted an extraordinary review of the company s operations 
on june   the company entered into a consent order with the faa under which i the company agreed to suspend operations until such time as the company was able to satisfy the faa as to various regulatory compliance concerns identified by the faa as a result of its intensive inspections of the company s operations  ii the faa agreed to work with the company in order to reestablish operations with up to aircraft initially  and iii the company paid million to the faa to compensate it for the costs of the special inspections conducted

see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion 
the expansion of the company s operations will likely be subject to faa and dot approval for an indefinite period of time 
the company is unable to predict how significantly the accident and suspension of operations will affect load factors and yield or the length of time load factors and yield will be impacted 
the company has sold certain of its aircraft and has assigned its rights to purchase certain aircraft previously under contract 
in addition  the company plans to lease out or sell some of its other aircraft 
in  the company refunded fares paid by customers affected by the company s changing schedules and by those who otherwise chose to change their travel plans 
the company s cost per asm has increased and is likely to remain inflated to some extent to reflect the cost of additional maintenance procedures and infrastructure adopted by the company and lower aircraft utilization levels 
the company may reduce its workforce permanently if reduced traffic levels continue and the company is unable to reestablish its previous service levels 
the aircraft lost was insured for million which was in excess of book value 
the company carries million of liability insurance 
although the company believes that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all claims arising from the accident  there can be no assurance that all claims will be covered or that the aggregate of all claims will not exceed such insurance limits 
several stockholder lawsuits have been filed against the company and certain of its officers and directors alleging  among other things  violation of federal securities laws 
while the company denies that it has violated any of its obligations under the federal securities laws and believes that the lawsuits do not have any merit  there can be no assurance that the company will not sustain material liability under such or related lawsuits 
various governmental authorities are conducting investigations of the circumstances surrounding the accident 
the company is cooperating with the authorities in connection with these investigations 
in light of these factors  persons investing in the securities of the company should be apprised of the following additional risks the suspension of operations has resulted in the failure of the company to meet certain financial covenants the fixed charge coverage ratio under certain of the company s secured debt 
this could result in the acceleration of such debt and a reduction in the company s cash position 
if the company does not timely repay all indebtedness accelerated or if the company s other secured lenders or the holders of the company s senior notes seek to accelerate their debt as a result of such accelerations  then a substantial portion or all of the company s debt could be accelerated 
the company does not have sufficient cash to satisfy all of its debt at this time 
there is no assurance that the company will recover sufficient customer acceptance in order to regain profitability 
if the company regains profitability  there may be reduced customer support which could decrease the company s profitability indefinitely 
the expansion of the company s operations will likely be subject to faa and dot approval for an indefinite period of time 
although preliminary information indicates no connection  if the national transportation safety board ntsb were to determine that the company s maintenance procedures or aging aircraft contributed to the cause of the accident  such determination could also have a substantial adverse effect on the company s future operations 
the occurrence of one or more subsequent incidents by the company s aircraft could likely have a substantial adverse effect on the company s public perception and future operations 
as a result of the accident  the ensuing extraordinary review of the company s operations by the faa and the suspension of operations in june and the current and prospective faa imposed limitation on the number of aircraft that may be operated by the company  the company s results for periods prior to may  are not necessarily reflective of the results to be expected in future periods 
the company s operations for are also not reflective of future operations as a result of the suspension of operations for a significant portion of the following is a description of the costs incurred by category for the year ended december  compared to year ends december  and year ended december  year ended december  of of amount revenues per asm amount revenues per asm operating revenues  c  c expense category flight operations   aircraft fuel   maintenance   station operations   passenger services   marketing and advertising   sales and reservations general and administrative   employee bonuses   depreciation   other expenses income  net shutdown and other nonrecurring total expenses  c  c year ended december  of amount revenues per asm operating revenues  c expense category flight operations  aircraft fuel  maintenance  station operations  passenger services  marketing and advertising  sales and reservations  general and administrative  employee bonuses  depreciation  other expenses income  net  shutdown and other nonrecurring  total expenses  c operating revenues total operating revenues for the year ended december  were approximately million as compared to million and million for the years ending december  and  respectively 
the decrease from to is a result of the company s reduced service level and suspension of operations during the second and third quarters of the increase over is due to the company flying more available seat miles asms during the company flew billion asms in as compared to billion and billion in and  respectively 
the company s load factors for  and were  and  respectively 
the lower load factor in is due to the accident and ensuing circumstances 
the company s average fare was for  for and for due to the absence of the federal excise tax for a substantial part of expenses flight operations expenses include all expenses related directly to the operation of the aircraft other than aircraft fuel  maintenance expenses and passenger services expenses 
expenses for hull insurance and compensation of pilots exclusive of bonuses are included in flight operations 
flight operations expenses were higher  on a per asm basis  for year ended december  than the previous two years due to the extended period of time that the company s operations were suspended  the additional training costs incurred at restart and the change in the company s compensation structure in september which reduced the percentage of compensation represented by bonuses and shifted this cost to base pay charged to each department 
the cost of hull insurance also increased substantially as of october  certain flight operations administrative costs were also incurred during the period of the suspension with no asms being generated over which to spread these costs 
aircraft fuel expenses include both the direct cost of the fuel as well as the costs of delivering fuel into the aircraft 
fuel expense  on a per asm basis was higher for than either of the previous two years due to an increase in the average cost of fuel 
the average cost for fuel increased from per gallon for to per gallon for to per gallon for this approximate increase in the price per gallon in fuel accounts for the increase in fuel cost per asm 
maintenance expenses include all administrative costs of the maintenance department as well as normal recurring maintenance performed during the year 
expenses for engine overhaul and certain scheduled heavy maintenance procedures are included in this cost 
most non routine maintenance costs performed during the suspension of operations are included in the nonrecurring expense line item 
maintenance expenses for the year ended december  were higher  on a per asm basis  than both and due to the suspension of operations during the second and third quarters of and the reduced level of service once the company was able to resume operations 
the company also had a lower utilization rate on the aircraft it operated which results in the spreading of certain fixed costs over fewer asms or block hours 
the company maintained or paid storage costs on many more aircraft than it was allowed to operate 
certain maintenance administrative costs were also incurred during the period of the suspension of operations with no asms being generated over which to spread these costs 
station operations expense includes all expenses incurred at the airports  as well as station operations administration and liability insurance 
certain facility rental expense related to non operating stations as a result of the suspension of operations are included in shutdown and other nonrecurring expenses 
stations operations expenses were higher  on a per asm basis  for the year ended december  than in and due to the shutdown and the inefficiencies generated from restarting operations on a limited basis 
many of the station facilities were not fully utilized during the fourth quarter due to the limited operation 
another factor which contributed to a higher station operations expense was an increase in insurance costs as of october  certain station operations administrative costs were also incurred during the period of the suspension of operations with no asms being generated over which to spread these costs 
passenger services expenses include flight attendant wages and benefits and catering expenses 
also included are the costs for flight attendant training and flight attendant overnight expenses 
the increase in passenger services expenses for  on a per asm basis  over and is due to the restructuring of the compensation policy as it relates to flight attendants 
the flight attendants salary levels were adjusted upward and the regular quarterly bonus portion of their compensation was eliminated 
this shift caused the department expense to be higher while reducing the amount of bonus expense 
marketing and advertising expenses include all advertising expenses and wages and benefits for the marketing department 
marketing and advertising expenses for  as a percentage of revenue  were higher than and lower than these expenses were higher in than due to the additional advertising costs incurred at the resumption of operations being spread over a reduced revenue base caused by lower service levels and load factors 
certain marketing administrative costs were also incurred during the period of the suspension of operations with no asms being generated over which to spread these costs 
sales and reservations expenses include all of the costs related to recording a sale or reservation 
these expenses include wages and benefits for reservationists  rent  telecommunication charges  credit card fees and travel agency commissions 
sales and reservations expenses for the year ended december  were of revenue as compared to for each of and general and administrative expenses include the wages and benefits for the company s executive officers and various other administrative personnel 
also included are costs for office supplies  legal expenses  bad debts  accounting and other miscellaneous expenses 
general and administrative costs for were higher than each of and due to the shift in compensation structure to one based to a larger extent on base salaries and also due to increased legal fees 
the amount of bonus expense for the year ended december  reflects the change in salary structure as of september to less of a bonus based structure and the fact that the company had a net loss from the second quarter through the end of the year 
the amount charged to approximates the amount paid out to those employees in the quarterly pool for the first quarter of the actual amount to be paid out and the form of such pay out are at the sole discretion of the company s board of directors 
depreciation expense includes depreciation on aircraft and ground equipment  but does not include any amortization of start up and route development costs as all of these costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation expense for the year ended december  was higher than each of the pervious two years as additional aircraft and other property have been acquired 
during  the company made the decision to dispose of certain idled aircraft 
subsequent to the decision to sell or lease out such aircraft  no depreciation was recorded on aircraft held for sale 
depreciation on aircraft idled as a result of the suspension of operations and reduced operations and not yet returned to service has been recorded in shutdown and other nonrecurring expenses 
shutdown and other nonrecurring expenses include costs associated with the loss of flight and excess operating costs related to the reduced schedule from may  to june   the suspension of operations from june  to september  and the reduced schedule from september  to december  such costs consist of expenses directly related to the accident and the ensuing extensive faa review of the company s operations including legal fees  payments to the faa  inspection related costs and unusual maintenance in excess of normal recurring maintenance 
in addition  depreciation on grounded aircraft  rental of abandoned or idled facilities and costs of personnel idled as a result of the reduced and suspended operations from may through december  are included in shutdown and other nonrecurring expenses 
personnel costs include full wages  salaries and benefits that were provided to idled employees during the reduction and suspension of operations 
a summary of such costs is as follows maintenance  legal and other consulting  facilities rental  wages  salaries and benefits  excluding maintenance  depreciation  faa remediation  other  the company also expects to incur additional shutdown and nonrecurring expenses in the first and second quarters of as a result of idled aircraft and facilities due to the reduced level of service attributable to the company s agreement with the faa 
no accrual was provided for costs to be incurred in future periods related to aircraft depreciation and maintenance and rental costs associated with temporarily idled facilities as such costs will be recognized as they are incurred 
there was no accrual for salaries and wages in connection with the furlough of employees at december  as such employees were paid through june  with no additional severance benefits provided 
other expenses income  net includes interest income and interest expense as well as certain property transactions 
during the year ended december   interest expense exceeded interest income by approximately  due to increasing debt levels attributable to the acquisition of aircraft and the completion of the issuance of million senior notes due during  the company also recognized million of income as an arrangement fee for aircraft transfers  a million gain from insurance recovery and a million gain on the sale of aircraft 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   the company used cash flow from operations of approximately million  used cash of approximately million to acquire property and equipment and generated cash flow from the disposal of property and equipment of million 
approximately million of cash was generated from the issuance of debt which was partially offset by debt repayments of approximately million 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
as of december   the company s fleet consisted of dc aircraft 
during the third quarter  the company sold three of its four md aircraft and all four of its dc aircraft  purchased two dc aircraft under contract and assigned its purchase rights with respect to the remaining dc aircraft and md aircraft under contract 
the company sold its last remaining md aircraft and two dc aircraft during the fourth quarter of and is actively pursuing the sale or lease of up to of its surplus dc aircraft 
the company has contracted with mcdonnell douglas for the purchase of md aircraft  at a cost of approximately billion subject to adjustments for inflation  for delivery in to approximately million of this amount will be paid in progress payments during and the balance of the purchase price after all progress payments will need to be paid or financed upon delivery of each aircraft 
if the company exercises its option to acquire up to an additional md aircraft  additional payments could be required beginning in this period 
the company expects to finance at least of the cost of each of these aircraft 
although mcdonnell douglas has agreed to provide assistance with respect to the financing of aircraft to be acquired  the company will be required to obtain the financing from other sources 
the company believes that with the assistance to be provided by mcdonnell douglas  aircraft related debt financing should be available when needed 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain sufficient financing on attractive terms 
if it is unable to do so  the company could be required to modify its aircraft acquisition plans or to incur higher than anticipated financing costs  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
the company s compliance with stage noise requirements will require substantial additional capital expenditures over the next several years 
by december   all of the company s aircraft must be brought into compliance with stage requirements 
the company intends to meet its stage noise requirement obligations by installing hush kits on stage aircraft  disposing of stage aircraft and acquiring stage aircraft 
the company expects that faa certified hush kits will cost approximately million per aircraft or approximately million for a fleet of non hushed dc aircraft as of december  any disposition of stage aircraft would reduce this obligation 
the company may be able to finance a portion of the cost of these hush kits and plans to make the balance of payments on these hush kits out of its working capital 
the company expects to pay the debt service on such loans out of cash flow generated from operations during the term of the financing 
the phase in period for full compliance with stage until december  and the expected terms of financing  if available  should allow the company to spread the payments for stage compliance over a number of years 
as of december   the company s debt related to asset financing totaled million  with respect to which the company s aircraft and certain other equipment are pledged as security 
the company has purchased all of its aircraft and  consequently  has no lease commitments relating to its aircraft fleet 
in addition  the company has million of senior unsecured notes outstanding 
the principal balance of the senior notes is due in and interest is payable semi annually 
all of the company s debt has final maturities ranging from to with scheduled debt amortization calculated without giving effect to any prepayment that may be required as a result of any covenant violations or sale of assets as follows million  million  million  million  million  and after million 
these notes provide for acceleration of their maturities upon certain defaults  including a payment default or defaults resulting in an acceleration of other debt of the company and its subsidiaries 
certain debt bears interest at fixed rates ranging from to per annum and is repayable in consecutive monthly or quarterly installments over a four to five year period 
certain other notes with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately million as of december  have a variable rate of interest based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus to at december  and december  based on the company s compliance with specific financial ratios concerning leverage and fixed charge coverage 
certain other notes have a variable rate of interest based on libor plus to 
a substantial portion of the secured notes require prepayment if specific financial ratios concerning debt to equity  net worth  fixed charge coverage and current ratio are not maintained 
of the million principal amount of secured debt as of december   there is debt with a principal balance of approximately million subject to loan agreements with financial covenants 
as of december   the company was in violation of the fixed charge coverage ratio with seven lenders on approximately million of debt 
the company has subsequently executed agreements with six of the seven affected lenders for the waiver or reset of this financial test for the fourth quarter of and each quarter in the remaining lender represents approximately million in outstanding debt  which has been classified as current maturities or debt on assets held for disposition  where appropriate  until such time as an agreement is completed 
the company expects to continue negotiations with this lender in an effort to reach a waiver agreement and avoid a prepayment event or acceleration of debt 
there can be no assurance that such negotiations will be successful 
the company continues to meet all of its debt payment obligations on time 
if the company is unable to successfully negotiate waivers or forbearance from its secured lender with financial covenants who has yet to agree to a waiver and if such lender demands prepayment of debt  then the company will be required to prepay such debt within a short period of time 
if the company fails to do so  then such secured lender would have the right to foreclose upon the aircraft securing such debt and other debt holders of the company including holders of the unsecured company s senior notes would have the right to accelerate the company s debt 
based on the language of the indenture governing the company s senior notes  the company believes that the holders of the senior notes would not have the right to accelerate the senior notes if the company pays off debt within the time provided after acceleration upon the occurrence of a prepayment event such as the failure to satisfy a financial covenant 
although the company has sufficient cash assets to pay its recurring obligations and debt service for an extended period of time  the company s failure to resume profitable operations may result in defaults under the company s secured debt and the acceleration of the company s debt 
in such event  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to satisfy all of its obligations on a timely basis 
as a result of the accident and suspension of operations  several class action suits have been filed by stockholders against the company and various officers and directors alleging  among other things  misrepresentations under applicable securities laws 
the plaintiffs seek unspecified damages based upon the decrease in market value of shares of the company s stock 
although management of the company intends to defend these actions vigorously and believes that the suits are without merit  any litigation contains elements of uncertainty and there can be no assurance that the company will not sustain material liability under such or related lawsuits 
numerous lawsuits have also been filed against the company seeking damages attributable to the deaths of those on flight  and additional lawsuits are expected 
the company s insurance carrier has assumed defense of these lawsuits under a reservation of rights 
as all claims are handled independently by the company s insurance carrier  the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of liability which might finally exist 
as a result  no accruals for losses and the related claim for recovery from the company s insurance carrier have been reflected in the company s financial statements 
the company maintains million of liability insurance per occurrence with a major group of independent insurers that provide facilities for all forms of aviation insurance for many major airlines 
although the company believes  based on the information currently available to it  that such coverage is sufficient to cover claims associated with this accident and that the insurers have sufficient financial strength to pay claims  there can be no assurance that the total amount of judgments and settlements will not exceed the amount of insurance available therefore or that all damages awarded will be covered by insurance
