as sales of any particular andrea anti noise registered trademark product increases  assembly operations are transferred to a subcontractor in asia 
most of the components for the andrea anti noise registered trademark products are available from several sources and are not characteristically in short supply 
however  certain more specialized components for the andrea anti noise registered trademark products  such as microphones  are available from a limited number of suppliers and subject to long lead times 
while the company has to date been able to obtain sufficient supplies of these more specialized components  no assurance can be given that it will continue to be able to do so

competition the markets into which the company sells its andrea anti noise registered trademark products and its traditional line of military and industrial products are highly competitive 
competition in these markets is based on varying combinations of product features  quality and reliability of performance  price  sales  marketing and technical support  ease of use  compatibility with evolving industry standards and other systems and equipment  name recognition  and development of new products and enhancements 
most of the company s current and potential page competitors in these markets have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical  and other resources than the company

in the markets for its traditional products  the company often competes with major defense electronics corporations as well as smaller manufacturing firms which specialize in supplying to specific military initiatives 
the company s performance in this market is further subject to several factors  including dependence on government appropriations  the time required for design and development  the complexity of product design  the rapidity with which product designs and technology become obsolete  the intense competition for available business  and the acceptability of manufacturing contracts by government inspectors 
the company believes that its ability to compete successfully will depend upon its capability to develop and maintain advanced technology  develop proprietary products  attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent or other proprietary protection for its products and technologies  and manufacture  assemble and successfully market products  either alone or through third parties

long term capital lease obligations     long term obligations      retained earnings deficit      total assets      page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview andrea electronics corporation is a market focused and applications driven technology company 
during its six decades of operations  the company believes that it has compiled a record of audio excellence in radio  television  military communications  and most recently  telecommunications and personal computer communications 
andrea electronics corporation s mission is to provide state of the art communications products for the voice interface markets that are rapidly emerging from the convergence of the telecommunications and computer industries and for the defense electronics markets  all of which markets are requiring increasingly higher quality voice communications products 
the company s strategy for serving these markets is to leverage its expertise in audio communications technology  including its patented active noise cancellation anc  also referred to as andrea anti noise registered trademark technology technology and active noise reduction anr technology  and to develop  manufacture  and market  either directly or through licensees  a line of andrea anti noise anc and anr headsets  handsets  and other communication devices that cost effectively enhance voice communications for end users of the growing number of new  voice based computer and computer telephony applications and interfaces 
examples of the applications and interfaces for which the company s products provide benefits include internet  intranet  and other computer based speech  telephony and communications  multi point conferencing  multi player internet and cd rom interactive games  speech recognition  multimedia  military and industrial communications  and other applications and interfaces that incorporate natural language processing 
the company believes that end users of these applications and interfaces will require high quality microphone and earphone products that enhance voice transmission  particularly to and from noisy environments  for use with personal computers  business and residential telephones  military headsets  cellular and other wireless telephones  personal communication systems  and avionics communications systems 
an important element of the company s strategy for expanding the channels of distribution and broadening the base of users for its anc and anr products is its set of collaborative arrangements with several hardware oems  software publishers  distributors  and retailers actively engaged in the various markets in which the company s anc and anr products have application 
under some of these arrangements  the company supplies its products for sale by the collaborative partners 
under others  the collaborative partners supply the company with software that the company sells with its anc and anr products 
in addition to these collaborative marketing arrangements  the company is also seeking to increase its own direct marketing efforts 
see part i item business collaborative arrangements 
while the demand for its traditional intercom products by the military market has declined  the company believes that there are a significant number of military applications for its anc and anr headsets and communications systems 
a primary purpose of the company s collaborative relationship with northrop grumman is to develop products specifically for these applications 
the company believes that these new anc anr products and systems  together with other anc microphone products that are being marketed to the us military under other initiatives  can be marketed to new military customers as well as the company s traditional military customers 
although the company had anticipated completion of the initial product qualification process during the first half of  the company currently believes that the process will be completed during in order to better address the final stages of the qualification process and perform more effectively under the agreement with northrop grumman in the event that the process is successfully completed  the company has formed andrea military communications  llc amc  a delaware limited liability company that is a majority owned subsidiary of the company 
amc will focus on collaborating with northrop grumman to qualify and market andrea anti noise registered trademark technology to military customers 
no assurance can be given that the product qualification process will be completed or  that if so  that the company will experience significant revenues through amc under the agreement with northrop grumman

the failure of the company to surmount the challenges posed by any one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and growth 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  were  an increase of nearly over sales of  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was attributable to a sharp increase in demand for the company s andrea anti noise registered trademark products 
this increase was offset by an expected decrease in sales of the company s traditional military products

see note to the financial statements 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  were  an increase of nearly over sales of  for the year ended december  the increase resulted partially from a significant and unexpected increase in demand for the company s traditional military business lines and to the introduction of the company s anti noise registered trademark products 
the increase for the year ended december  in sales to the company s customer base for its traditional military products was contrary to the downward trend in the company s sales to this market in recent years resulting from decreases in military appropriations by the page us government 
management does not believe that the increase for the year ended december  in sales of its traditional products to its military customer base reflected a reversal of this downward trend in demand for these products

general  administrative and selling expenses general  administrative and selling expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  the increase for the year ended december  reflects the marketing and sales expenses  such as advertising  packaging  and promotional expenses  associated with the company s introduction of its anti noise registered trademark products to the direct and consumer electronics retail and catalog markets as well as certain non recurring expenses related to the agreements with ibm and bellsouth 
in addition  an amount of  was included in general  administrative and selling expenses for the year ended december  reflecting the settlement on february  of certain litigation with a former employee of the company 
the total amount of the settlement was  including the  amount and an additional  in respect of an expired capital lease

page net loss net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  this reduction in net loss reflected principally the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was  compared to  at december  the increase in working capital reflects an increase in total current assets of  and an increase in total current liabilities of  the increase in total current assets reflects a decrease in cash of  an increase in investment securities of  an increase in accounts receivable of  an increase in inventory of  an increase in deferred tax asset of  and a decrease of  in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the decrease in cash of  reflects  of net cash used in operating activities and  of cash used in investing activities  partially offset by an increase in cash from financing activities of  the principal operating activity for which cash was used was the increase in inventory of andrea anti noise registered trademark computer headsets 
the increase in inventory of  primarily resulted from the acquisition of  of long lead components and parts for andrea anti noise registered trademark products and an increase in work in process and finished goods inventory of  for the andrea anti noise registered trademark products

the company received  in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible debentures and  from the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of employee stock options 
the decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets includes the expensing of prepaid advertising  property taxes  and prepaid insurance premiums 
the decrease in current liabilities primarily reflects a  decrease in trade accounts payable  a decrease of  in current maturities of capital lease obligations 
the increase in trade accounts payable is primarily attributable to the of raw materials for the andrea anti noise registered trademark products
