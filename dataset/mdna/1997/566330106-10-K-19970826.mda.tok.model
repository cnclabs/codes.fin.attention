revenues of the theatre business and the motion picture industry in general are heavily dependent on the general audience appeal of available films  together with studio marketing  advertising and support campaigns  factors over which the company has no control 
fiscal included such box office hits as independence day  the star wars trilogy  mission impossible  the rock  nutty professor  a time to kill and ransom  while fiscal included the hits apollo  toy story  twister  batman forever  grumpier old men and pocahontas

approximately the same number of first run films were released in fiscal years  and total box office receipts in fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from million in fiscal fiscal box office receipts increased million  or  compared to fiscal these increases are attributable to and increases in attendance in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increases in attendance are due to the increase in new screens each year 
attendance at the company s comparable locations was down in fiscal and flat in fiscal  compared to the previous year 
fiscal attendance at the company s theatres  and the industry in general  was adversely affected by the summer olympics 
not only did television coverage of the olympics reduce movie theatre attendance  but many motion picture film distributors anticipated lower theatre attendance during the olympics and released their best films during the late spring and early summer of in order to avoid competing with the olympics 
this strategy meant that less attractive films were distributed in late summer and early fall  with the result being reduced attendance late in the company s fiscal first quarter and the lack of quality holdovers into the company s fiscal second quarter 
the decrease in fiscal attendance compared to the prior year was also due to the additional week of operations in fiscal this additional week in fiscal included the memorial day weekend  which is traditionally one of the year s busiest motion picture viewing weekends

as a result of the occupancy and average daily rate increases  the division s total revpar increased in fiscal compared to the prior year 
fiscal operating results were also favorably impacted by reduced charges for pre opening costs for the milwaukee hilton formerly the marc plaza and increased management fees from properties managed but not owned by the hotels and resorts division 
the division s miramonte resort  currently under renovation  did not have a material effect on fiscal results 
increased occupancy at the grand geneva resort spa as a result of greater market awareness and the reduction of start up related expenses  together with the revenue from having the restored and renovated milwaukee hilton open for the entire fiscal year and the impact of increased average daily room rates at all three of the company s owned hotels  were the primary reasons for the division s increased fiscal revenues and operating income compared to the prior year 
the division s total revpar increased in fiscal compared to the prior year 
however  the amortization of the hilton s pre opening costs  the loss of revenue from the non renewal of an operating agreement for the sheraton mayfair inn in milwaukee  wisconsin  together with the effects on occupancy of adverse winter weather  negatively impacted the division s fiscal operating results
