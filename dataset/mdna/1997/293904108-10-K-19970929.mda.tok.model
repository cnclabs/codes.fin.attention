item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal years ended june   and revenues 
revenues for the year ended june  increased to  as compared to  for fiscal the components of revenues are sales  which consist of sales of the company s products and royalties on the sale of such products by others  and contract revenues 
sales increased by to  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase was due to an increase in oncaspar revenues and an increase in adagen sales of approximately  resulting from an increase in patients receiving adagen treatment 
net sales of adagen  which is marketed by enzon  for the years ended june  and were  and  respectively 
oncaspar  the company s other approved product  is marketed in the us by rpr and in europe by medac

the increase was also due to the commencement of shipments during fiscal of oncaspar to medac for the european market 
the company expects sales of adagen to increase at comparable rates as those achieved during the last two years as additional patients are treated 
the company also anticipates moderate growth of oncaspar sales to its partners and increased royalties on rpr sales of oncaspar for the currently approved indication 
rpr and medac are conducting clinical trials to expand the use of oncaspar beyond its current approved indication which could also result in additional revenues from this product 
there can be no assurance that any particular sales levels of oncaspar or adagen will be achieved or maintained 
contract revenue for the year ended june  decreased by to  as compared to  for fiscal the decrease was principally due to the one time gain  in the prior year  related to the exercise of warrants received from neoprobe corporation and sale of the underlying securities

it is anticipated that schering will manufacture all future clinical trial material 
this decrease was offset in part by increased adagen sales and increased revenues from oncaspar  which is marketed by rpr  of approximately  adagen sales for the years ending june  and were  and  respectively

cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  increased to for the year ended june  as compared to for fiscal the increase was due primarily to a payment in lieu of satisfying the minimum purchase requirements under the company s long term supply agreement for a raw material used in the production of oncaspar and the write off of excess inventories of this raw material 
while it is possible that the company may incur similar losses on its remaining purchase commitments under the supply agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements  the company does not consider such losses probable  nor can the amount of any loss which may be incurred in the future presently be estimated due to a number of factors  including but not limited to potential increased demand for oncaspar from rpr  expansion into additional markets outside the us and the possibility that the company could renegotiate the level of required purchases 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by for both of the years ended june  and  when compared to the prior years 
the decreases were primarily due to i reductions in personnel made during fiscal  principally in the clinical and research administration areas  and related costs  such as payroll taxes and benefits and ii other cost containment measures resulting from the narrowing of the company s research efforts to focus on technologies and products with large revenue potential

other income expense 
other income expense decreased by  to  for the year ended june  as compared to  last year 
the decrease was due principally to the recognition in the prior year as other income of approximately  representing the unused portion of an advance received under a development and license agreement with sanofi winthrop sanofi 
during october  the company learned that sanofi intended to cease development of peg sod dismutec tm due to the product s failure to show a statistically significant difference between the treatment group and the control group in a pivotal phase iii trial 
due  in part  to this product failure  the company believes it has no further obligations under its agreement with sanofi with respect to the  advance and  therefore  the company recognized as other income the amount due sanofi previously recorded as a current liability 
other income expense increased by  to  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june  the increase was due principally to the recognition during fiscal of the sanofi advance discussed above 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  earnings per share 
sfas establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share 
in accordance with the effective date of sfas  the company will adopt sfas as of december  this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources enzon had  in cash and cash equivalents as of june  the company invests its excess cash in a portfolio of high grade marketable securities and united states government backed securities 
the company s cash reserves as of june  decreased by  from june  the decrease in cash reserves was the result of the funding of operations 
during august  the company received  from schering in milestone payments under the company s license agreement for peg intron a 
the payments were the result of peg intron a moving into phase iii clinical trials 
the company s amended rpr license agreement for oncaspar provides for a payment of  in advance royalties which was received from rpr in january royalties due under the amended rpr license agreement will be offset against an original credit of  which represents the royalty advance plus reimbursement of certain amounts due rpr under the previous agreement and interest expense  before cash payments will be made under the agreement 
the royalty advance is shown as a long term liability  with the corresponding current portion included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets and will be reduced as royalties are recognized under the agreement 
through june   an aggregate of  in royalties payable by rpr has been offset against the original credit 
as of june    shares of series a preferred shares had been converted into  shares of common stock 
accrued dividends on the converted series a preferred shares in the aggregate of  were settled by the issuance of  shares of common stock 
the company does not presently intend to pay cash dividends on the series a preferred shares 
as of june   there were accrued and unpaid dividends totaling  on the series a preferred shares 
these dividends are payable in cash or common stock at the company s option and accrue on the outstanding series a preferred shares at the rate of  per year 
to date  the company s sources of cash have been the proceeds from the sale of its stock through public and private placements  sales of adagen  sales of oncaspar  sales of its products for research purposes  contract research and development fees  technology transfer and license fees and royalty advances 
the company s current sources of liquidity are its cash  cash equivalents and interest earned on such cash reserves  sales of adagen  sales of oncaspar  sales of its products for research purposes and license fees 
management believes that its current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements  based on current spending levels  for approximately the next two and one half years 
upon exhaustion of the company s current cash reserves  the company s continued operations will depend on its ability to realize significant revenues from the commercial sale of its products  raise additional funds through equity or debt financing  or obtain significant licensing  technology transfer or contract research and development fees 
there can be no assurance that these sales  financings or revenue generating activities will be successful 
in management s opinion  the effect of inflation on the company s past operations has not been significant
