item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources the table below sets forth silverado s working capital and liquidity for the years indicated november  cash and cash equivalents    other current assets    accounts payable and accrued liabilities    loans payable secured by gold inventory   payable to related parties  current portion of mineral claims payable    current portion of capital lease obligation    working capital deficiency    the major increase in the company s working capital from a deficiency of  at the end of to a surplus of  at the end of resulted from private placements and the exercise of options 
the company further decreased its liabilities by executing and paying off lease purchase options on several large items of heavy mining equipment 
subsequent to year end the company s president  jp tangen  relinquished his office to the company s previous president  garry anselmo  who assumed those duties on an unpaid basis 
this change is part of an overall strategy by the company to reduce its administrative overhead 
the decrease in revenues from gold sales from  in to  in is attributable to the company s reduced production schedule from its nolan properties as it focused its primary efforts upon its extensive fairbanks claims in response to the large amount of competitive activity in that area 
as part of this process  the company was able to further develop its ester dome project  develop two other properties for potential sale  and to acquire  by location  the square mile chatanika property northwest of fairbanks 
long term liabilities consist of the long term portion of the company s remaining capital lease obligation  and the company s two million dollar debenture which has a maturity of july   if not sooner converted 
the company intends to continue its efforts to define ore bodies on ester dome so as to bring that property into production as soon as practical  and simultaneously  continue its placer operations at nolan creek 
the company intends to continue the solicitation of additional capital through either equity or debt financing  and may also engage in joint venturing or other similar arrangements conducive to accelerating production at ester dome 
there is  however  no commitment by any party to provide such financing at this time  nor assurance that such capital will be available on terms favorable to the company 
the company has received  subsequent to the year end as a result of options to purchase common stock being exercised 
management believes the company has adequate funds to operate for the coming fiscal year  and will continue its exploration and development programs as additional funds become available 
operating results nolan gold project in november   the company commenced production of placer gold from frozen bench deposits on the mary s bench portion of the dionne property 
since then  almost  ounces of gold have been recovered 
information gained during the early mining operations resulted in a management decision to engage in the construction of a larger infrastructure including the construction of a thirty man camp  a larger machine shop  the acquisition of several pieces of earth moving equipment and a more aggressive drilling program 
these costs have yet to be fully defrayed by production 
the company continued a limited production program in during the course of reclamation activities  as it focused its primary efforts on expansion  exploration  and development of its fairbanks properties in response to increased competitive activity in that area 
the company intends to continue development of both placer and lode gold deposits at nolan in hammond property in december  the company entered a lease with option to purchase an additional property adjoining the nolan gold project 
this new property has a history of gold production and the company anticipates that it will add to the potential for developing additional gold reserves 
the property also has lode gold and antimony potential  which the company intends to further explore and define in ester dome gold project the company has a percent interest in the ester dome gold project 
the company commenced a number of geophysical surveys in on gold bearing target areas selected from acnc s data and silverado s own previous drill results  then expanded this data with an intensive trenching and drilling program in to date  the company has identified gold mineralization over a length of  feet  widths up to feet  and to a depth of feet with grades up to ounces per ton 
the company intends to further define this ore body so as to be able to bring it into production as soon as practical 
marshall dome gold project the marshall dome gold project was acquired by the company in it covers an area of two and one half square miles  and is located eighteen miles northeast of fairbanks 
on november   the company entered into an agreement in principle to vend this property to homestake mining company in return for annual cash payments  annual expenditures on the property  and the payment of a net smelter return to the company in the event of the sale of gold or other valuable minerals  but that agreement in principle has not yet been consummated 
whiskey gulch property this property  acquired by the company in to further enhance the desirability of its previously acquired marshall dome property  above  is part of the unconsummated agreement in principle with homestake mining 
mining and environmental regulation mining activities in the us are subject to regulation and inspection by the mining safety and health administration of the united states department of labor 
in addition  the company s activities are regulated by a variety of federal  state  provincial and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and other matters 
many agencies have the authority to require the company to cease or curtail operations due to noncompliance with laws administered by those agencies 
the operation of mining properties also requires a variety of permits from government agencies 
management believes that it has in place all required permits for the company s planned operations 
management knows of no areas of noncompliance with laws or regulations which could close or curtail operations 
the company has accrued a total of  for further reclamation on the nolan gold project 
additional remediation work takes place during the normal course of mining 
in the event of closure or abandonment  the additional cost of reclamation would not be material 
the company posted bond of  in january  with the alaska statewide bond pool to cover this event 
with regard to the ester dome gold project  in the case of closure or abandonment  the company estimates that any reclamation costs  net of recovery  would be immaterial 
nature of claims under federal and state law the company s properties consist of unpatented federal mining claims and state mining claims 
titles to unpatented claims are subject to inherent uncertainties  such as whether there has been a discovery of valuable minerals on each claim and whether proper locating and filing prerequisites have been met  and such title can only be maintained by the performance of adequate annual assessment work and or the payment of prescribed rental fees 
while the company believes that all claims which it holds were properly located under applicable law  no assurances can be given in that regard 
to date  the company believes that it has conducted and recorded all annual assessment work necessary to maintain the claims in good standing 
changes to us mining laws currently under consideration would  if enacted  substantially affect all holders of unpatented federal mining claims by imposing royalty fees on removal of minerals and fundamentally changing the rights and status of unpatented claim holders 
although management believes that the imposition of royalty fees as described above  at a minimal level  would not have a material adverse effect on the company  it is impossible to predict the extent to which mining or environmental legislation may be enacted or amended nor the effect that such legislation could have on the company 
other expenses years ended november  other expenses    the company s total other expenses increased in as a direct result of the increase in employment contract expense see note d which are in part accrued  and related to a number of agreements for services in specialized marketing and investor relations fields 
depreciation and amortization increased due to reclassification of some of the company s assets 
interest on long term debt represents the semi annual installments on the company s  convertible debenture 
as with most companies involved in the mining industry  the price of the company s product mainly gold has a significant impact upon the company s profitability 
similarly the company s costs  as reflected in labor and materials are also affected by inflation 
during the fiscal year ended november   the price of gold remained fairly stable  as did the rate of inflation and  thus  neither item significantly affected the company s performance
