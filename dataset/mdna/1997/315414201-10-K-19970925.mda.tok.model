item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information to assist in the understanding of ferrofluidics results of operations and financial condition 
it should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data in the preceding section and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere herein 
results of operations fiscal versus fiscal in fiscal  net income declined to  or 
per share  compared to  or 
per share  recorded in fiscal the decline was the result of lower sales volumes and increased expenses  particularly in the areas of marketing and product development 
in fiscal  product revenues decreased to  from  in fiscal this decrease in the company s level of business can be directly attributed to a significant decline in the semiconductor industry in general  which accounts for all of the revenues of the systems segment and a substantial portion of the components segment revenues 
the changes in revenues by segment are summarized as follows systems   components   distributed products   total revenues   the decrease in revenues in the systems segment in was due principally to a delay in the contractual shipment schedules relating to certain multi unit orders received in the prior year from the company s largest customer 
further slowdowns in the schedule of shipping machines to this customer are expected in the next fiscal year  as the customer has at present committed to receive one machine per month for the fiscal year  a decline from the average of a little under three machines per month in fiscal during the first three quarters of fiscal  a slowdown in the production of capital equipment for the semiconductor industry caused demand for the company s rotary feedthrough seals to decline sharply  resulting in an decrease in consolidated revenues from the components segment 
during the fourth quarter  the order rate for seals began to improve as the outlook for the industry improved 
revenues in the distributed products segment  which principally serves the thin film deposition industry  remained relatively level with those of last year 
total sales from the company s european subsidiary  ap t  which includes the sale of the company s components and fluid products in europe  as well as comprising the distributed products segment  decreased to  in  as compared to  in fiscal the decrease was entirely within the ferrofluidic product lines  as the distributed products revenues remained level with the prior year 
sales by the company s japanese subsidiary  fjc  increased to  over the  of revenues in sales of seals and fluids increased over in  evidencing the company s penetration into that market 
in addition  the company sold a significant number of crystal growing systems  both of a prototype and production nature  to five of the major japanese silicon wafer manufacturers  resulting in a substantial increase in revenues in japan 
despite the significant increase in business with japan  total foreign sales declined to  from  in  because the majority of the non japanese crystal puller shipments were to domestic customers in  whereas shipments were primarily to korean and taiwanese wafer manufacturing facilities 
bookings in decreased  to  from  in  as orders for crystal growing systems declined substantially as a result of industry over capacity 
fiscal bookings included  in orders of crystal growing systems and related equipment  as compared to  in the majority of the bookings were from one affiliated group of customers 
in contrast  the crystal growing systems orders received during included orders from a number of different and unrelated international wafer suppliers in scandinavia  eastern europe  taiwan  china  and japan 
these orders reflect the success of the company s efforts in the past two years to reduce its dependence on one customer 
order bookings in the company s components division  which includes the sale of seals and fluids  totaled  which includes bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal of  a record for the segment 
the resulting order backlog for that segment at the end of the fiscal year was  an increase of over the components division backlog at june  consolidated order backlog at june  totaled  as compared to  at june  of the consolidated backlog at june   approximately is expected to ship during the coming fiscal year 
the consolidated gross margin for the year ended june  of increased slightly over the gross margin of in the previous year 
although revenues declined  the overall product mix was essentially unchanged 
lower gross margins were experienced in the crystal growing systems business due to expenses related to the development of machines for new customers  but this was offset by an increase in the margins in the components segment 
consolidated operating income before general corporate and non operating expenses declined in to of product revenues as compared to in this was the result of lower revenues  higher sustaining engineering  and higher product development costs 
the company spent  during fiscal on engineering and product development  an amount equal to of product revenues compared to  or of product revenues in the preceding year 
engineering costs as a percent of revenues increased in principally due to the increased level of first time  or prototype  systems sold during  as well as the increased development work in the area of mm crystal growing systems 
of the total engineering and product development expenditures in fiscal   was in the systems division as compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
the balance of engineering and product development expenditures were made for development of seals and fluids products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in increased  or over such expenses in  and increased as a percent of revenues from in to in selling and marketing costs increased by  due in part to a  increase in selling expenses in japan  a  increase in sales commissions and a  increase in selling expenses in europe 
administrative expenses accounted for the rest of the increase  which was due in part to increases in legal costs  personnel costs  severance  and insurance and stock based compensation 
interest income in was down from that in  due principally to lower levels of invested cash 
interest expense of  is up over the  in the prior year as a result of higher borrowings against the company s revolving line of credit 
see note e to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of the company s debt obligations 
the company records transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currency as other income or expense 
during fiscal   of net foreign currency transaction losses were recorded as compared to a net gain of  in fiscal the losses in  primarily incurred by the company s japanese subsidiary whose functional currency is the us dollar for accounting purposes  arose as a result of the weakening of the japanese yen against the dollar during much of gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the us dollar are recorded directly to equity 
the balance of other income expense in was principally amortization of bank financing costs  which did not change materially from the previous fiscal year 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company recorded  in the fourth quarter of  a  tax benefit from a reduction of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that is required to be recorded when the company s management is of the opinion that the tax benefit is more likely than not to be realized 
the recording of this benefit may affect the company s effective corporate tax rate in future periods 
income tax expense of  in consisted of a provision for state and foreign income taxes on the company s earnings and a federal alternative minimum tax provision 
see note d to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of income taxes 
fiscal versus fiscal in fiscal  net income was  or 
per share  as compared to  or 
per share  in in fiscal  product revenues increased to  from  in fiscal the overall increase in the company s level of business can be directly attributed to the growth in the semiconductor industry in general  which accounts for all of its systems segment and a substantial portion of its components segment 
the increases in revenues by segment are summarized as follows systems   components   distributed products   total revenues   the increase in revenues from systems is attributed to increased demand for silicon wafers and the resulting increase in production capacity for the wafers 
during and  the company received orders for over of its model cz crystal growing system  which grows millimeter diameter silicon ingots 
increases in the production of capital equipment by oem s in the semiconductor industry have driven the demand for our component seals and sealing subsystems resulting in a increase in consolidated revenues from the components segment 
distributed products  which principally serves the thin film deposition industry  showed a modest revenue increase in total sales from the company s european operations  ap t  which includes the sale of the company s components and fluid products in europe  as well as comprising the distributed products segment  increased to  in as compared to  in fiscal sales by the company s japanese operation  fjc  totaled  up from  in during  fjc experienced a significant increase in its sales order activity for both components products and crystal growing systems 
total foreign sales increased over to  in from  in due primarily to the shipment of crystal growing systems to large scale wafer fabrication facilities in korea and taiwan 
bookings in increased to  from  in the prior year 
of the new business booked   represented orders of crystal growing systems and related equipment  as compared to  in the prior year 
order backlog at june  totaled  as compared to  at june  during july and august of  the company  in consultation with its customers  rescheduled approximately one half of the shipments of crystal pullers initially scheduled for fiscal into future years 
the consolidated gross margin for the year ended june  of declined from the gross margin of in the previous year due to the change in product mix of revenues 
in  of consolidated revenues pertained to crystal growing systems  which generate lower gross margins  as compared to in the prior year 
consolidated operating income  before general corporate expenses and nonrecurring operating income  improved in to of product revenues as compared to in operating income in the systems segment improved from of revenues in to in in the components segment  operating income improved from of revenues to 
the company expended  during fiscal on engineering and product development  representing of revenues compared to  or of revenues in the preceding year 
of the total engineering and product development expenditures in fiscal   was in the systems segment as compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
the remaining balance of expenditures related to engineering and development of the company s core products  including seals and fluids 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in increased  or over those of  however  declined as a percent of revenues from in to in contributing to the increase in sg a expenses are increased warranty provisions and increased sales commissions to third parties 
also included in the increase in sg a expenses is a  increase in general corporate expenses  which includes a  increase in non cash stock related compensation 
as more fully discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements  in september  the company discontinued the operations of a subsidiary and  in november  entered into an agreement to license certain of its technology to a third party 
as a result of these transactions  the company recorded nonrecurring operating income in fiscal of  interest income in was down from that in due principally to the cancellation of certain paid up insurance policies on the life of a former officer which is more fully discussed in note c to the consolidated financial statements 
invested cash remained at low levels as a result of the need to finance the operations of the business 
interest expense of  is also down from the prior year due to the elimination of borrowings against the canceled insurance policies 
see note e to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of the company s debt obligations 
the company records translation and exchange gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currency as other income expense 
the net impact of currency translation and exchange was  and  of income in and  respectively 
included in the income from currency translation in was a gain of approximately  which the company realized upon the sale of its investment in ferrotec 
the balance of other income expense in and was principally amortization of bank financing costs 
the income tax expense in of  is comprised principally of a provision for state and foreign income taxes on the company s earnings and a federal alternative minimum tax provision 
the tax provision in includes approximately  in various state and foreign taxes  offset by a benefit of approximately  resulting from the recording of a tax asset in europe at ap t reflecting that business s return to profitability from continuing operations 
see note d to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources in  the operations of the business used  of cash  which was principally the result of the increases in accounts receivable and inventories and the decline in the balance of deposits from systems customers 
this cash requirement was financed from borrowings under the company s expanded revolving line of credit as discussed below 
cash receipts from the sale of crystal growing systems under large multi unit contracts are typically received by the company as certain milestones are met  including receipt of the order  submission of accepted engineering drawings  shipment and final acceptance of the units 
in and  the company received advance payments of  and  respectively  in connection with orders for crystal growing systems 
in order to secure its sources of supply for critical long lead inventory items  the company has also had to make advance payments to its vendors 
the balance remaining on deposit with vendors was  at june  the company has purchase contracts for inventory with various suppliers which  in some cases  extend beyond two years 
at june   outstanding purchase commitments pursuant to these contracts totaled approximately  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at the end of both and working capital at june  increased to  from  at june  current assets increased  principally due to higher accounts receivable balances  as the receivable turnover decreased in compared to as a softening in the semiconductor industry caused customers to lengthen their payment terms 
inventory balances increased somewhat in as compared to  but reduced business levels caused overall inventory turnover to decline to times annual consumption in from in in december  the company entered into a new agreement with its bank which resulted in the expansion of its revolving line of credit from  to  this change is discussed in more detail in note e to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures totaled  in  as compared to  in the spending in both years consisted primarily of various improvements to the company s nashua facility  including the final acceptance of a machine for its in house machine shop  and additions to the company s computer hardware and software 
the company is considering plans to undertake a significant increase in its facilities in connection with the development of its mm crystal puller business 
proceeding with these plans  if decided upon  may require the company to develop new sources of financing to supplement its internal cash generation and current borrowing arrangements 
the company has long term financing in the form of a  variable rate industrial revenue bond vrirb that is subject to a variable rate of interest keyed to short term nontaxable rates at june    the proceeds of which were primarily used to fund the construction of the company s nashua  nh headquarters 
the company has a credit facility with its bank which provides the company with total credit of approximately   of which is in the form of a stand by letter of credit for the company s vrirb  and  increased from  in december of which is a revolving line of credit for working capital purposes 
the stand by letter of credit has a term of five years with a fee of per year and the revolving credit facility bears interest at prime rate plus with a fee of on the unused portion 
at june    was outstanding against the revolving line of credit 
during  the company borrowed  in the form of a demand note with its bank  for working capital purposes  which had interest at prime plus 
in  this demand note was canceled as the balance was rolled into the newly increased revolving line of credit 
also during  the company borrowed  in the form of an installment demand note with its bank  to finance the capital expansion of its in house machine shop  which bears interest at 
at june   the balance on this note was  in addition  the company  through its wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  has various short term facilities with local banks totaling approximately  at june  during  the maximum outstanding borrowing on these foreign credit lines was  the weighted average interest rates during the year on these facilities ranged from to and the interest rates at june  ranged from to 
management believes that current financial resources working capital and short term borrowing arrangements and anticipated funds from operations will be adequate to meet cash requirements in the year ahead  with the possible exception of financing related to the facility expansion referred to above 
the company has undertaken to develop new sources of financing to supplement its present capabilities in this area 
effects of inflation inflation rates over the past three years have remained relatively low and  as a result  have not had a material impact on the financial results of the company 
this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  and section e of the securities exchange act of there are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking statements 
these include  but are not limited to  cancellation of letters of intent  further rescheduling of existing crystal puller orders  additional crystal puller orders from existing or new customers  including those mentioned in the report  lack of new crystal puller orders from existing or new customers  change in revenues in the company s components  fluids  and thin film deposition businesses  and a material change in the market conditions within the semiconductor industry 
for additional information concerning these and other important factors which may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from expectations and underlying assumptions  please refer to the reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission
