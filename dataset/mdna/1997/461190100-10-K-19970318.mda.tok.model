item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations introduction the company reported a net loss in of million on revenues of million  as compared to a net loss of million on revenues of million in  and net earnings of million on revenues of million in as discussed more fully below  the company s performance throughout reflects the soft market trends which began in late and continued throughout over capacity in the truckload industry  inclement weather conditions and higher fuel costs combined to produce lower freight rates  reduced equipment utilization  and significantly higher operating costs early in the year 
business strengthened later in the year as a stronger us economy and a resumption of construction activity increased demand for transportation services 
however  substantially higher fuel prices  continued competitive pressures on freight rates  certain third quarter charges  and other increased costs continued to negatively impact the company s profit margins 
while the effects of the higher fuel prices were blunted  to a degree  through the implementation of fuel surcharges  competitive conditions limited the surcharges to only a portion of the company s revenues 
management estimates that the higher fuel costs alone  net of surcharge revenue retained by the company  reduced margins by approximately million in the three months  and approximately million in the full year ended december   when compared to fuel prices paid in the comparable periods of management has taken a number of actions in response to these competitive conditions including implementing fuel surcharges  raising rates where competitively feasible  reducing staffing levels  cutting other fixed costs and increasing marketing efforts 
these actions are all beginning to take effect  and management is cautiously optimistic that these and other actions will return the company to profitability 
however  factors outside of the company s control  including continued high fuel prices and actions of competitors  may continue to adversely affect the company in a discussion of the impact of the above and other factors on the results of operations in as compared to  and as compared to follows 
compared to key operating statistics change operating revenues millions net earnings loss nm average tractors   
total loads s revenue miles millions avg 
revenue per revenue mile operating revenues 
operating revenues increased by million  or in to million from million in the majority of this increase occurred in the owner operator fleet where revenues increased by million or 
brokered revenues also increased nearly in over  while company fleet revenues increased 
the increase in revenue miles volume in is primarily attributable to an increase in the average number of owner operator trucks up 
the decrease in average revenue per revenue mile price is a result of significantly sharper competitive conditions which drove prices down in early while pricing recovered somewhat later in the year  some of the increased prices resulted from fuel surcharges intended to recover steeply higher fuel costs 
without fuel surcharges  the average revenue per revenue mile would have declined by in over operating expenses 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of operating expenses to operating revenues for the years ended december  and operating revenues operating expenses purchased transportation and equipment rents salaries  wages and benefits fuel and other operating expenses operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims depreciation other operating expenses total operating expenses in  the mix of company operated versus owner operator equipment began to shift back towards owner operator equipment  although the company was still primarily dependent on company operated tractors 
approximately of the company s revenue was generated with company operated equipment in  as compared to approximately in the relatively higher use of owner operator equipment in resulted in decreases in salaries  wages and benefits  and fixed costs related to ownership or lease of revenue equipment  and increases in owner operator purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue 
offsetting this trend towards higher owner operator based costs  and lower company operated equipment costs  however  was steeply higher fuel costs incurred to operate company equipment in management estimates that the approximately cent per gallon higher fuel price in resulted in increased fuel costs of approximately million over those incurred in operating taxes and licenses were relatively unchanged in when compared to the company s insurance expense increased to of revenue in from of revenue in this increase results primarily from increased provisions for accident claims 
approximately one third of the company s insurance expense in represented premium payments 
the remaining two thirds of the expense is comprised of estimates for claim and deductible obligations resulting from accidents and claims 
depreciation expense increased in as compared to as the company replaced older  fully depreciated trailers with new  modern replacement units 
other operating expenses decreased to of revenue in from in primarily as a result of reduced accounts receivable service fees  coupled with reduced legal and professional fees 
the company ceased selling certain accounts receivable to a collection clearing house effective june  interest expense 
interest expense decreased by approximately million in as compared to  due to lower interest and fees on the company s bank credit facility 
the credit facility was amended on january   lowering the interest rate from over prime to over prime  and reducing credit facility fees 
in addition  the prime rate was lower in  on average  than in average borrowings outstanding were flat

no provision for income taxes was provided in as a result of the operating losses incurred 
a million increase in net deferred tax assets was offset by a million increase in valuation allowances 
a provision for income taxes of approximately million  or approximately of pre tax earnings  was provided in the higher than statutory effective tax rate results from the effect of certain non deductible expenses 
compared to key operating statistics change operating revenues millions net earnings nm average tractors   total loads s revenue miles millions average revenue per revenue mile operating revenues 
operating revenues were essentially unchanged in at million versus million in while total revenues remained unchanged  revenues generated with company operated equipment increased million or  and brokered revenues increased million or 
at the same time  owner operator revenues declined by million  or 
the decrease in owner operator revenues in over is primarily attributable to the sharply reduced owner operator revenues at c 
i 
whitten transfer company ciw  the company s munitions motor carrier subsidiary sold in august  the increase in total loads volume in is primarily attributable to an increase in the average number of company operated tractors up  coupled with an increase in brokered traffic  offset by reduced loads hauled by owner operators 
the decrease in revenue per revenue mile price is a result of reduced traffic opportunities in due to the less robust us economy  which required the company to move more equipment with lower priced spot market loads 
in addition  the lower revenue contribution by ciw in over reduced the average company wide rate per revenue mile 
operating expenses 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of operating expenses to operating revenues for the years ended december  and operating revenues operating expenses purchased transportation and equipment rents salaries  wages and benefits fuel and other operating expenses operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims depreciation other operating expenses total operating expenses in and  the mix of company operated versus owner operator equipment continued to shift  although less significantly than in recent years  toward company operated equipment as a result of increased competition for qualified owner operators  and the company s ability to secure affordable financing and freight to operate additional company tractors 
approximately of the company s revenue was generated with company operated equipment in  as compared to approximately in the relatively higher use of company operated equipment resulted in increases in salaries  wages and benefits  fuel and other operating expenses and fixed costs related to ownership or lease of the equipment  and decreases in owner operator purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue 
in addition  the company has raised the pay rates for its drivers in order to continue to be able to attract sufficient qualified drivers 
lastly  in february  the company commenced treating all driver pay as taxable compensation  and eliminated driver road expense payments 
this increased taxable driver compensation  resulted in higher payroll related taxes and insurance 
the company s insurance expense decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in this decrease results primarily from reduced liability insurance premium rates due to improved accident control over the past several years  and to higher deductible retentions by the company 
approximately two thirds of the company s insurance expense in represented premium payments 
the remaining one third of the expense is comprised of estimates for claim and deductible obligations as a result of accidents and claims 
operating taxes and licenses increased in as compared to as a result of the greater proportion of company operated equipment in  for which the company is responsible for operating taxes and licenses 
depreciation expense decreased in as compared to as the company has replaced owned or capital leased tractors primarily with operating leased tractors 
other operating expenses decreased to of revenue in from in due to reduced communication and other miscellaneous expenses  offset somewhat by increased expenditures for legal and professional fees in as compared to interest expense 
interest expense decreased by approximately million in as compared to  primarily as a result of the replacement of capital leased equipment with equipment financed under operating leases  coupled with reduced bank interest and fees as a result of lower average bank borrowings  offset by higher average interest rates in as compared to  and the company s convertible subordinated debentures were converted to common stock on march   thereby eliminating the related interest expense thereafter 
following is a summary of interest expense for the years ended december  in millions interest on debentures interest and fees on notes payable to banks interest on capital leases and other indebtedness provision for income taxes 
a provision for income taxes of approximately million  or approximately of pre tax earnings  was provided in the higher than statutory effective tax rate results from the effect of certain non deductible expenses 
a provision for income taxes of approximately million  or approximately of pre tax earnings  was provided in as more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company s provision for income taxes was favorably influenced by the release of valuation allowances held against certain net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources the company generated million of cash and cash equivalents in the year ended december   as compared to a use of cash of million in as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  in  million of cash was generated from operating activities  and million  net  was generated from investing activities through sale of equipment 
approximately million  net  of this cash was used in financing activities for principal payments on long term debt 
in march  the company began to reduce the sale of certain customer accounts receivable to a collection clearing house  a process which was completed on june  this resulted in an increased use of cash from operating activities to finance approximately million  net  of accounts receivable which would otherwise have been sold to the clearing house 
the company s day to day financing is provided by borrowings under its bank credit facility 
the credit facility consists of a million term loan with a final maturity of december   and a revolving line of credit  with a maximum limit of million  which expires january  quarterly principal payments of  on the term loan commenced on april  the line of credit includes provisions for the issuance of up to million in stand by letters of credit which  as issued  reduce available borrowings under the line of credit 
borrowings under the line of credit are limited to amounts determined by a formula tied to the company s eligible accounts receivable and inventories  as defined in the credit facility the borrowing base 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit totaled million at december   and outstanding letters of credit totaled million at that date 
the combination of these two bank credits totaled million and  given the then existing borrowing base  left approximately million of borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit at december  the comparable borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit as of march  was million 
the decrease in borrowing capacity from december to march results primarily from the financing of annual license plates and permits for the company operated fleet 
the company s borrowing capacity typically is lowest in the first half of the year  and increases throughout the second half of the year 
during the last quarter of  management became aware that the losses that would be reported for would cause the company to not be in compliance with the net worth and certain other financial covenant tests contained in the loan agreements for december  and later periods 
management requested that the bank waive non compliance with these provisions  and establish new net worth and other financial covenant tests 
subsequent to year end  the company and the bank executed an amendment to the loan agreements which waives non compliance with such tests and establishes new tests which management believes the company will be able to meet for the remaining term of the credit facility 
the company currently believes that cash generated from operating  financing and investing activities and cash available to it under the bank credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s needs during other factors 
inflation can be expected to have an impact on most of the company s operating costs although the impact of inflation in recent years has been minimal 
changes in market interest rates can be expected to impact the company to the extent that revenue equipment is added and replaced and because the company s bank financing is based on the prime rate 
the trucking industry is generally affected by customer business cycles and by seasonality 
revenues are also affected by inclement weather and holidays because revenues are directly related to available working days of shippers 
customers typically reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season 
the company s revenues tend to follow this pattern and are strongest in the summer months 
generally  the second and third calendar quarters have higher load bookings than the fourth and first calendar quarters
