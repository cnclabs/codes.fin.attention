olympic sells a broad range of products  many of which have different gross margins

accordingly  the company s overall gross margin is affected by product mix and the amount of processing performed  as well as volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs

domestic steel producers generally supply domestic customers before meeting foreign demand  particularly during periods of supply constraints 
as a result  domestic and international sales tend to be countercyclical 
because the company conducts its operations generally on the basis of short term orders  backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future performance
