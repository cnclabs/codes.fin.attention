funds from operations management considers ffo to be a supplemental measure of the company s operating performance 
ffo  as modified in january by nareit is defined as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  less gains or losses from debt restructuring  plus real estate depreciation and amortization and plus minority interest in partnership 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the following table illustrates the calculation of ffo for the year ended december   and in thousands nareit ffo definition for the years ended december  net income available to common shareholders    add back less real estate depreciation and amortization    litigation settlement gain on sale of cap and collar minority interest in partnership    extraordinary item  non recurring transfer cost  non cash compensation expense to reflect values of operating partnership units income from unconsolidated entities ffo from unconsolidated entities funds from operations    weighted average shares units outstanding    under the new nareit definition of ffo  non cash charges for non real estate depreciation  loan amortization fees and interest rate buydown amortization are deducted in computing ffo 
for the years ended december   and these non cash charges total million  million and million  respectively

this increase was partially offset by increased interest expense of million and increased general and administrative expense of million 
ffo increased  or million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of improved property net operating income of million  partially offset by increased interest expense of million  increased non real estate depreciation and loan fee amortization of  increased general and administrative expense of  and the  non cash compensation expense to reflect values of operating partnership units 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years and has had a minimal impact on the company s properties 
many tenants leases contain provisions designed to lessen the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than years  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rentals if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
substantially all of the leases  other than those for anchors  require the tenants to pay a proportionate share of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
however  inflation may have a negative impact on some of the company s other operating items 
interest expense and general and administrative expenses may be adversely affected by inflation as these specified costs could increase at a rate higher than rents 
also  for tenant leases with stated rent increases  inflation may have a negative effect as the stated rent increases in these leases could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time 
other the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season  when tenant occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  shopping malls achieve most of their temporary tenant rents during the holiday season 
as a result of the above  earnings are generally highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
the retail industry has experienced some difficulty  which is reflected in sales and occupancy trends and in bankruptcies and restructuring of some prominent retail organizations 
continuation of these trends could impact future earnings performance
