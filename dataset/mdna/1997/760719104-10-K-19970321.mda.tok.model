net interest income increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in while spreads narrowed in when compared to the prior year  average interest earning assets rose billion in  to billion  or over this increase was primarily due to the additional interest earning assets acquired from bbi  and the investment of proceeds from deposit liabilities acquired from first nationwide savings bank  bank leumi trust company and independence savings bank 
higher levels of investment securities were funded by deposits in foreign offices and short term borrowings 
the net interest rate differential declined to in  from in  as the rate on interest earning assets declined more than the rate on interest bearing funds

the provision for credit losses rose to million in  compared to million in and million in while no specific credit concerns exist  the increase in the provision for credit losses in over the prior year was considered prudent by management in consideration of increased domestic and foreign exposures 
in  a weakening in the domestic chain store sector contributed to higher levels of domestic charge offs that were partially offset by recoveries from foreign debtors in foreign restructuring countries 
the decline in the provision in from the prior year reflected management s view that the level of the allowance for credit losses was adequate to provide for potential credit losses

during  the corporation invested in initiatives designed to increase revenues in future periods and in infrastructure to support and control those operations 
retail banking expenses increased as a result of the branch expansion mentioned above 
growth in the volumes of mortgage and home equity loans  as well as  increased sales of investment products resulted in the payment of additional fees for related services 
the corporation continued to invest in broadening the array of its investment product offerings  including the recent introduction of an asset allocation product which is targeted at retail clients 
republic financial services saw significant expansion during the year to include offering full service and discount securities brokerage services to corporate and retail clients 
the corporation also invested in trading market services and in advanced risk management systems to support its expanding trading operations 
the development of a new profitability measuring system which will enable the corporation to efficiently measure and present line of business results also contributed to the higher expense level 
in the second quarter of  the corporation recorded a million pre tax provision for restructuring and related charges as a result of the implementation of project excellence plus 
for additional information on this charge see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data elsewhere in this report 
in addition  in  the corporation converted the financial reporting of factors and its operations in chile and uruguay to a current basis in the fourth quarter of the year 
the conversion resulted in a one time increase to expense of million for the year 
the restructuring and related charges in resulted from a management decision to de emphasize certain business activities  including those of rnysc 
in  a similar conversion of financial reporting of the corporation s hong kong and singapore operations resulted in a one time increase to expenses of million 
salaries and employee benefits salaries and employee benefits were million in  million in and million in the increase in salaries and benefits in over the prior year reflects staff additions attributable to the acquisitions mentioned above  recently established operations and to the achievement of higher revenue thresholds that required higher provisions for incentive compensation reflecting more competitive market conditions 
the level of salaries and benefits was virtually unchanged between and  due to the implementation of project excellence plus  with resultant staff reductions throughout the corporation and lower provisions for employee benefits 
occupancy occupancy costs were million in  million in and million in the increase in is primarily due to the acquisition of branches during the year that included a one time charge of million related to branch consolidations 
the increase in is primarily attributable to increased rent expense 
other expenses all other expenses were million in  million in and million in communication and equipment expenses represent a substantial portion of other expenses which amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets rose to million in from million in and million in the increase is primarily due to the acquisition of bbi and other branches that occurred during the year

other expenses in also included the effect of adopting a change in the method of accounting for charitable contributions that resulted in a million  one time charge 
expenses applicable to net losses on other real estate owned were million in total applicable income taxes total applicable income taxes  which includes the effect of a taxable equivalent adjustment  increased million in to million  following a decline of million in from the ratio of total applicable income taxes to income before taxes was in and and in the increase in total applicable income taxes in reflected the higher level of taxable income for the year which was reduced by a one time million tax benefit recognized as a result of a tax law change enacted in august this one time income tax benefit was recognized by the corporation because it was no longer liable for deferred taxes which had been provided in prior years for credit provisions of republic bank for savings 
the decline in total applicable income taxes and the lower effective income tax rate in when compared to  was attributable to lower earnings caused by the provision for restructuring charges and fluctuations in the level of income subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
net income applicable to common stock net income applicable to common stock was a record million in  compared to million in and million in on a fully diluted basis  earnings per common share were in  in and in dividends declared and the average annual rates paid on the corporation s issues of preferred stock were as follows million in at  million in at and million in at 
liability and asset management changes in the level of interest rates and the relationship between rates can affect net interest income 
in general  the corporation s on and off balance sheet assets are selected to match both the maturity and interest rate sensitivity of the corporation s on and off balance sheet liabilities 
the structure of the corporation s liabilities determines the structure of its assets 
this practice has two important implications 
first  liquidity requirements can be met more readily because a large proportion of assets mature when liabilities mature 
second  the impact of changes in the levels of interest rates on the corporation is reduced because assets and liabilities have approximately the same interest rate sensitivity 
diversification is another principle employed in the management of liabilities and assets 
the corporation is active in international banking and  in managing this activity  diversifies risks among many countries and counterparties throughout the world 
liabilities  which are mostly interest bearing deposits and other purchased funds  are obtained from both domestic and international sources 
these sources of funds represent a wide range of depositors  mostly individuals  and various types of deposits 
the corporation also raises funds from institutional and individual investors with a variety of marketable instruments 
the diversification of the corporation s funding sources provides stability of the funding base 
from time to time  the corporation s management may decide deliberately to mismatch on and off balance sheet liabilities and assets in a strategic gap position as a means of managing net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity gaps occur when interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets differ in repricing dates and anticipated maturities 
such decisions reflect management s views on the direction of interest rates and general market conditions 
the gap position is established with marketable securities of high credit quality in liquid markets and is carefully monitored by management 
the corporation uses off balance sheet interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps  caps  options and forwards in managing its exposure to interest rate sensitivity resulting from its gap position 
the corporation monitors the near term interest rate sensitivity of its liability and asset positions by quantifying the earnings at risk to simulated changes in interest rates 
a net interest income simulation model measures this sensitivity 
this model utilizes monte carlo simulation  a statistical technique that allows the corporation to build variability around current market conditions 
inputs include the maturity and repricing characteristics of the corporation s on and off balance sheet liability and asset positions as well as assumptions on interest rates  asset prepayments  inter bank spreads and deposit growth 
given the assumptions used  the model s output projects the variance in net interest income over the next year 
the board of directors adopted a limit of of annual net interest income at risk  based on this measured interest rate sensitivity 
results are periodically presented to the asset and liability management committee and to the board of directors 
simulation modeling gives a broader view of net interest income variability than does traditional gap analysis  allowing the corporation to capture more variables that are interest rate sensitive and to explore interrelationships between variables 
to complement the simulation model  the corporation employs traditional gap analysis to provide information on longer term interest rate sensitivity 
the table below illustrates the corporation s interest rate sensitivity gap position at december  and the interest rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and liabilities  is presented by repricing period  based upon maturity or first repricing opportunity  along with a cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap 
factors considered are the contractual terms of the underlying obligations  including off balance sheet items such as interest rate swaps and caps  as well as management s estimates of prepayment patterns of mortgage backed securities and interest sensitivity of core deposits 
it is important to note that the table indicates a position at a specific point in time and may not be reflective of positions at other times during the year or in subsequent periods 
major changes in the gap position can be  and are  made promptly as market outlooks change 
in addition  significant variations in interest rate sensitivity may exist within the repricing periods presented in which the corporation has interest rate positions 
repricing period at december  within after one after three after seven one year but within years but within years but within after year three years seven years ten years ten years in millions asset liability interest rate sensitivity gap    asset liability cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap    repricing period at december  within after one after three after seven one year but within years but within years but within after year three years seven years ten years ten years in millions asset liability interest rate sensitivity gap  asset liability cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  in  the corporation made additional long term investments  primarily mortgage backed securities  which were funded with short term liabilities in order to take advantage of an anticipated stable interest rate environment 
as a result  more of the corporation s liabilities will reprice within one year than the assets which they fund 
this resulted in an increase in the interest rate sensitivity gap in the and year repricing periods 
the following table presents information related to the expected maturities and weighted average interest rates to be received or paid on the interest rate swap portfolio and other instruments used in asset liability management

in december  the corporation reassessed the appropriateness of its investment securities portfolio classifications under a one time provision granted in a special report issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
as a result of this portfolio reassessment  the corporation transferred certain securities with a book value of approximately billion from held to maturity to available for sale 
the securities and hedges transferred had a carrying value in excess of market value of approximately million 
during  the corporation sold billion face value of long term us government agency securities that had been classified as available for sale 
in addition  the corporation reviewed its intent to hold certain us government agency securities that had been designated as available for sale and  as a result  transferred securities with a carrying value of approximately billion to the held to maturity classification 
the unrealized depreciation  before tax effect  on this transfer was million at year end and is included in the separate component of stockholders equity 
net investment securities gains of million in included gains of million from the sale of argentine equities acquired in a debt for equity swap and million from the sale of securities received in connection with brazil s debt restructuring

average loans in foreign offices rose to billion in after a decline to billion in from billion in see risk management and control credit risk below in this section of this report

the following table is an analysis  at december   of loans due after one year which have fixed interest rates and those with interest rates that vary directly in relation to the corporation s reference rate  an international money market rate or some other similar variable base rate 
loans with variable rates amounting to approximately billion are due after one year 
fixed rate variable rate total in thousands loans due after one year domestic loans    foreign loans    allowance for possible credit losses the corporation s policy is to maintain an allowance for credit losses that is adequate to absorb any inherent credit losses 
inherent losses are unconfirmed losses that probably exist  based upon known information regarding the credit quality and portfolio characteristics prevailing as of the date of the evaluation 
if future events confirm these losses  these amounts will be charged off against the allowance for credit losses 
in accordance with regulatory guidance  the corporation performs a comprehensive and consistently applied analysis of the various factors that affect collectibility 
the process is complex and includes several different analyses of credit exposures 
management analyzes its loan portfolio by three main components individually significant loans  homogeneous groups or pools of loans and other segmentations of the portfolio into pools of loans with similar characteristics  such as risk classification  type of loan  industry group  collateral  size and maturity and country risk characteristics 
management periodically reviews the loan portfolio  particularly non accrual and restructured loans 
the review may result in a determination that a loan should be placed on a non accrual status for income recognition 
in addition  to the extent that management identifies potential losses in the loan portfolio  it reduces the book value of such loans  through charge offs  to their estimated collectible value 
the corporation s policy is to classify as non accrual any loan other than factored trade accounts receivable  consumer installment and residential mortgage loans on which payment of principal or interest is days past due 
in addition  a loan will be classified as non accrual if  in the opinion of management  based upon a review of the borrower s or guarantor s financial condition  collateral value and other factors  payment is questionable  even though payments are not days past due 
when a loan  other than a well secured residential mortgage loan  is classified as non accrual  any unpaid interest is reversed against current income except where the loan is well collateralized and it is anticipated that all unpaid interest will be collected 
the loan remains in a non accrual classification until such time as the loan is brought current  when it may be returned to accrual classification 
when principal and interest on a non accrual loan are brought current  if in management s opinion future payments are questionable  the loan would remain classified as non accrual 
subsequent payments of either interest or principal received on a partially charged off non accrual or restructured loan are first applied to any remaining balance outstanding  until the loan is reduced to its net realizable value  then to recoveries and finally to income 
interest is included in income thereafter only to the extent received in cash 
factored trade accounts receivable that are past due days remain on an accrual basis because the past due interest usually will be charged to and collected from the factoring client 
the large number of consumer installment loans and the relatively small dollar amount of each makes an individual review impracticable 
the corporation charges off any consumer installment loan which is past due days 
residential mortgage loans are placed on non accrual status when the mortgagor is in bankruptcy or foreclosure proceedings are instituted  at which time the loan ceases to accrue interest 
any accrued interest receivable remains in interest income as an obligation of the borrower 
the individually significant loans represent larger  more problematic loans which are individually assessed as to collectibility 
for homogeneous portfolios  principally the consumer retail portfolio  the corporation utilizes the prior year s loss experience to estimate an amount necessary to provide for the upcoming twelve months of expected losses 
for the other segmentations of the portfolio  historical loss rates are calculated for loans with similar characteristics 
these loss rates are updated quarterly and are based upon the loss experience incurred for more than the last five years 
while historical loss rates provide a starting point for the corporation s analysis  historical losses are not by themselves a sufficient basis to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses 
the actual rate selected for the analysis may differ from the calculated loss rate as the historical rate may be adjusted upward or downward to reflect current and anticipated business and economic conditions and other factors which are likely to cause the current portfolio to differ from historical experience 
the corporation s allowance also reflects a margin for the imprecision in the estimates of expected credit losses 
the resultant allowance for credit losses is viewed by management as a single  unallocated allowance available for all credit losses and any segmentation thereof is done only for compliance with reporting requirements 
the following table presents data related to the allowance for possible credit losses and net charge offs for each of the years in the five year period ended december  in thousands balance at beginning of year      charge offs domestic commercial and industrial      installment loans to individuals      secured by real estate

the provision for credit losses declined slightly to million in from million in the economic improvement in domestic and foreign markets  which was noted in  continued into however  in  a weakening in the domestic chain store sector contributed to higher levels of domestic charge offs that were partially offset by recoveries from foreign debtors in foreign restructuring countries 
the provision for credit losses declined to million in  compared to million in as economic improvement in domestic and foreign markets contributed to an enhancement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio and a declining level of non performing loans and net charge offs 
the lower levels of the provision for credit losses and net charge offs in compared to  reflected the gradual economic improvement in domestic markets during the years 
the provision high of million was recorded in when the corporation experienced increased charge offs because of economic difficulties by a limited number of domestic and commercial businesses and a limited number of international obligors

also excluded from the above table are loans past due days and still on accrual status  primarily residential mortgage loans  which amounted to million  million  million  million and million at year ends    and  respectively 
the increase in past due and accruing residential mortgage loans are those acquired from bbi 
at december  in each of the years through  the corporation s allowance for possible credit losses represented approximately    and  respectively  of total non accrual and restructured loans 
the decline in the coverage from to is primarily associated with non performing loans acquired from bbi in substantially all of the increase in non performing loans acquired from bbi is covered by an fdic loss sharing agreement 
the corporation s allowance for possible credit losses  after taking into consideration the fdic loss sharing agreement  would be of total non accrual and restructured loans 
the coverage of the allowance for credit losses to non accrual and restructured loans is only one subjective measure of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses that management utilizes 
non accrual domestic loans increased to million in from million in and million in the increase was primarily attributable to the non accrual loans acquired in the bbi acquisition substantially all of which are covered by an fdic loss sharing agreement 
the change in non accrual loans between and the prior year was primarily the result of increases of non accrual loans in the chain store sector and reductions in the commercial real estate portfolio that were charged off or transferred to the other real estate owned classification 
in order to comply with certain regulatory reporting requirements  management has prepared the following allocation of the corporation s allowance for possible credit losses among various categories of the loan portfolio for each of the years in the five year period ended december  in management s opinion  such allocation has  at best  a limited utility 
it is based on management s assessment as of a given point in time of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change 
such allocation is not indicative of either the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge offs may be taken  nor should it be taken as an indicator of future loss trends 
in addition  by presenting such allocation  management does not mean to imply that the allocation is exact or that the allowance has been precisely determined from such allocation

outstandings are classified by type of borrower  based on ultimate risk  and are defined as loans  acceptances  interest bearing deposits with banks  investment securities and accrued interest receivable  after deducting cash collateral 
countries where such outstandings exceeded of consolidated total assets of billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively  were as follows banks and other government commercial financial and official and institutions institutions industrial in millions japan     belgium luxembourg    united kingdom    france    canada   germany  brazil netherlands australia includes excess of local currency outstandings over local currency liabilities

when necessary  the corporation utilized interest rate and foreign currency futures to hedge its local currency position against short term changes 
at december   total cross border net outstandings in brazil consisted primarily of brady bonds and short term investments amounting to approximately million  or of total assets  all of which were on a performing basis 
cross border net outstandings in brazil at december  consisted of approximately million of the public sector  million of the private bank sector and million of the private non bank sector  respectively

the corporation seeks to control these risks by diversifying its exposures and activities among many instruments  markets  clients and geographic regions and by limiting its positions in various instruments and investments 
the processes and procedures by which the corporation manages its risk profile continually evolve as the corporation s business activities change in response to market and product developments 
the corporation routinely reviews its procedures in order to ensure that they are comprehensive with respect to all major risks and that a consistent approach is followed throughout the organization 
to enhance the environment for the corporation s risk management activities and assist in decision making  significant investments have been made in the training of personnel and in the development of information technology 
proprietary and analytical trading systems have been developed for the corporation s existing and future business 
this control environment is subject to periodic review by management  internal auditors and regulators 
the risk assessment committee of the corporation s board of directors oversees the identification  measurement and limitation of the risks relating to all activities of  and products offered by  the corporation 
such committee s activities include review of risk management methodologies employed by management 
the committee is supported by the risk assessment and control department  whose task is to develop and implement risk quantification and reporting mechanisms 
this department also monitors market related risk exposure on a daily basis  reporting to management 
credit risk credit risk for lending  trading and investment activities and products represents the possibility of loss to the corporation if a borrower or counterparty fails to honor their commitment to repay contractual obligations 
credit risk and exposure to loss are inherent parts of the banking business 
management seeks to manage and control or limit these risks through its loan and investment policies  including obtaining collateral  and credit review procedures 
senior management establishes and continually reviews lending and investment criteria and approval procedures that it believes reflect the risk averse nature of the corporation 
the credit review committee of the board of directors periodically reviews and approves the corporation s policies and procedures to define  measure and monitor the credit and settlement risks arising from the corporation s diverse activities 
global limits are established to control these risks  and it is the responsibility of each operating unit to conduct its business activity within these prescribed limits 
any customer credit  currency or transaction exposure that exceeds established limits must be approved by senior management 
management s objective in establishing lending and investment standards is to minimize the risk of loss 
in the case of foreign investments and loans  management emphasizes investments and loans to  or with guarantees of  governments  government agencies or banks 
in addition  the corporation places particular emphasis on the matching of the maturity and interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities 
by this policy  the corporation seeks to minimize the effect of rate changes  largely externally influenced and difficult to control  on the portfolio and to limit its exposure primarily to credit risks over which it has more direct control 
one technique which the corporation utilizes to achieve these goals is to enter into interest rate contracts  including swaps  caps and collars  and currency swaps  each of which is designed to protect against interest rate or currency fluctuations 
see liability and asset management  for additional information on interest rate management 
the credit review department provides an independent evaluation of the corporation s credit exposures and assures ongoing credit quality by reviewing individual credits and concentrations  with a focus on operating units where risk is at a higher level  and monitoring of corrective action where necessary 
additionally  the credit review department evaluates adherence to laws and regulations and to policies and established criteria as stated in the corporation s credit policy manual to assure compliance with such standards 
the credit review department also periodically prepares portfolio summaries for review by executive management and the board of directors 
these reports are then submitted for consideration to certain members of executive management who determine the amount of loans to be charged off 
the executive credit committee subsequently reviews the loans to be charged off and ratifies executive management s decision 
rules and formulae relative to the adequacy of the allowance  although useful as guidelines to management  are not final determinants 
in addition  any loan or portion thereof which is classified as a loss by regulatory examiners is charged off 
consistent with its policy of maintaining an adequate allowance for possible credit losses  management generally charges off a loan  or a portion thereof  when a loss is probable 
market risk market risk is the possibility of a decline in value of the corporation s assets net of hedges acquired in the course of its trading activities and asset liability management 
to manage market risk  the corporation establishes limits for interest rate  foreign currency and other market exposures 
an important tool in monitoring exposures and establishing limits for substantially all products offered is the estimation  under a range of assumptions  of the potential loss of current and future earnings on existing positions within the markets being measured 
the management asset and liability committee provides a forum for reviewing the corporation s liquidity profile and the market risk in its asset and liability management and trading positions 
the management asset and liability committee regularly reviews the corporation s market exposures and analyzes the effects of actual or projected changes in rates  prices or market liquidity on the value of these positions 
such committee also reviews the corporation s liquidity profile by monitoring the differences in maturities between assets and liabilities and by analyzing the future level of funds required based on various assumptions  including its ability to liquidate investment and trading positions and its ability to access the markets for funds 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements below in this section of this report 
capital resources and liquidity capital financing policy the corporation s policy is to obtain capital externally  when opportunities arise  if the cost of such capital is reasonable and the form is appropriate for the corporation s needs and overall capital structure 
in keeping with this policy  capital has been obtained externally on several occasions  although  at such times  the corporation  relative to other major bank holding companies  was considered to be well capitalized 
the corporation conducts its business through its bank and non bank subsidiaries

the guidelines require a minimum ratio of capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit and derivative instruments of 
at least half of the total capital ratio is to be composed of common equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  preferred securities less goodwill and intangible assets subject to certain minimums tier or core capital 
the remainder may consist of limited amounts of subordinated debt  the balance of cumulative preferred stock and the allowance for credit losses tier capital 
as a supplement to its risk based capital ratios  the frb established leverage capital standards based upon the definition of tier capital 
these standards require the most highly rated banks to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of at least if they are not anticipating or experiencing any significant growth and meet certain other conditions 
each of the corporation s banking subsidiaries complies with all applicable regulatory capital requirements 
the corporation s leverage ratio and its risk based capital ratios include the assets and capital of safra republic on a consolidated basis in accordance with the requirements of the frb specifically applied to the corporation 
these ratios do not include the effect on stockholders equity related to the corporation s portfolio of securities available for sale 
in accordance with regulatory guidelines  the corporation excludes rnysc s assets and off balance sheet contracts from the corporation s capital calculations 
the guidelines also require the corporation to deduct one half of its investment in this subsidiary from each of tier and tier capital

it is expected that these ratios will decline slightly in the first quarter of as the corporation has agreed to redeem million of permanent preferred stock 
liquidity of primary importance to depositors  creditors and regulators is the ability of the corporation to have sufficient funds readily available to repay liabilities as they mature 
in order to insure that funds are available at all times  the corporation devotes substantial resources to projecting the amount of funds which will be required on a daily basis and maintains relationships with a diversity of sources so that funds are available on a global basis 
through its worldwide network  the corporation obtains funds from a large and varied customer base that provides a stable source of core domestic demand and consumer deposits  and foreign office deposits 
other sources provide short term borrowings  including the sale of commercial paper and long term liabilities in the form of notes and debentures and common and preferred stock 
liquidity requirements also can be met through the disposition of short term assets that are generally matched to the maturity of liabilities 
liquid assets include cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits with banks  federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements  trading account assets and precious metals 
average total liquid assets were approximately of average total assets in  compared to and in and  respectively 
in  the corporation invested in assets with longer term maturities 
the corporation s portfolio of securities available for sale of billion at december   can be readily sold to meet any immediate cash flow obligations 
in each of the last three years the corporation used net cash flows from investing activities to increase asset growth 
during and financing activities provided net cash flows of approximately billion and billion compared to net uses of approximately million in
