general granite is one of the largest heavy civil contractors in the united states and is engaged in the construction of highways  dams  airports  mass transit facilities and other infrastructure related projects 
the company has offices in california  texas  georgia  nevada  arizona and utah 
the company s contracts are obtained primarily through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local agencies and private parties 
the company s bidding activity is affected by such factors as backlog  current utilization of equipment and other resources  ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
bidding activity  backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts to the company may vary significantly from period to period 
revenue from construction contracts including construction joint ventures is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting  based upon costs incurred and projected costs 
revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
the related earnings are not recognized until the period in which such percentage completion is attained 
cost of revenue consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs  equipment expense primarily depreciation  maintenance and repairs and insurance costs 
depreciation is provided using accelerated methods for construction equipment 
contracts frequently extend over a period of more than one year and revisions in cost and profit estimates during construction are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revision become known 
losses on contracts  if any  are provided in total when determined  regardless of the degree of project completion 
claims and change orders for additional contract revenue are recognized to the extent of costs incurred in the period when it is probable that the claim will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
the foregoing as well as weather  stage of completion  and mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods 
the company s compensation strategy for selected management personnel is to rely heavily on a variable cash and restricted stock performance based incentive element 
thus  the company may experience an increase in general and administrative expenses in a very profitable year and a decrease in less profitable years 
further  the company does not utilize incentives  such as stock options  that are not reflected in current earnings 
the company s pension contribution in excess of the k matching contributions is at the discretion of the board of directors based on the company reaching certain levels of profitability each year 
current year revenue and backlog 
during the year ended december   revenue increased million to million 
the increase in revenue is associated with higher levels of bidding opportunities and awards in our branch division and a full year of utah branch activity in the branch division revenue increased million to million in  from million in heavy construction division hcd revenue decreased million to million in  from million in the company s revenue from private sector contracts increased million to million  and went from of total revenue in to of total revenue in revenue from public sector contracts decreased to million  or of the company s revenue in  from million  or in the company s backlog at december  was million  up million  or over the same period in management expects that approximately of the work in the backlog at december  will be recognized as revenue during the company believes its bidding opportunities in its major marketplaces remain strong see outlook

outlook 
this outlook section contains forward looking statements which are made in reliance on the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of investors are cautioned that such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  changes in the composition of applicable federal and state legislation appropriation committees  federal and state appropriation changes for infrastructure spending  the general state of the economy  competition and pricing pressures  state referendums and initiatives  and other risks detailed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
looking forward  will be a pivotal year for transportation funding  particularly at the federal level  where congress takes up reauthorization of the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act istea 
the bill  signed by then president bush in december   was a six year  billion program providing federal monies for highway and transit construction 
the bill expires october  any changes in actual appropriations will not impact the company or the industry until and beyond 
four reauthorization proposals have been submitted to the house subcommittee on surface transportation 
the first proposal  istea works  is essentially a status quo of the existing legislation  albeit it does call for the maximum level of federal investment possible over the next five years in our nation s multi modal transportation systems 
the second proposal  the istea integrity restoration act  seeks to simplify and reduce some of the complex funding formulas under istea and would specify that federal fuel taxes in the federal highway trust fund be used solely for highway construction  and not for deficit reduction or other non highway related purposes 
the third and perhaps most controversial proposal is the transportation empowerment act  also known as devolution 
this bill would substantially reduce federal fuel taxes and shift the bulk of the responsibility for levying fuel taxes and maintaining transportation systems to the states 
we believe this bill could prompt a reduction in total transportation expenditures as states would find it extremely difficult to raise taxes  even if the taxes merely replaced what was previously being levied by the federal government 
the last transportation plan is that of the clinton administration s  a proposal to fund the program at billion over six years  which would be approximately more money than was authorized in the act 
in fact  there appears to be growing support on capitol hill for substantial increases in highway spending 
senator john warner r va  is proposing approximately billion in increases in the highway program over the next five years 
efforts also continue in washington to redirect the cents of the federal fuel tax being used for deficit reduction to the federal highway trust fund and to remove the trust fund from the unified federal budget 
furthermore  legislation was recently introduced to allow private developers to issue tax exempt bonds to finance public infrastructure projects 
looking ahead in california  legislators in sacramento this year will resume the debate over how to pay for the unanticipated increase in cost to retrofit the san francisco oakland bay bridge as well as whether to retrofit the eastern span or build a new bridge 
bay area legislators are looking to the state highway account to make up the shortfall while highway builders and southern california legislators argue that increasing bridge tolls is the appropriate way to pay for the additional costs 
in a recent survey by the san francisco chronicle of bay area residents  were said to favor raising the bridge toll to finance a new bridge 
such support could make a toll increase more politically palatable for bay area legislators and temper their zeal to siphon monies out of the highway account 
maintaining a viable highway program is vital to the state s economy and important to granite s business 
however funded  granite expects to bid on much of the bridge retrofit or replacement projects 
cautious optimism describes our outlook for private sector opportunities in california 
the california economy outpaced the nation in income and job growth in  according to the center for the continuing study of the california economy 
moreover  the factors that created the strong economy in a leadership position in technology  foreign trade  entertainment and tourism  and professional services is expected to bring continued growth in and the decade ahead 
it is apparent to us  though  that the real estate sector of the economy continues to lag the recovery and has yet to translate into a big increase in bidding opportunities for residential site development projects 
looking at our concerns for  our industry is confronted with a shortage of skilled labor  which affects companies like ours in a number of ways 
lack of skilled labor limits our ability to take on additional work  impacts productivity and ultimately leads to higher wage rates 
in response  granite has increased its investment in craft and technical training and will continue to focus on education and training for all its employees 
recently we have seen fuel prices creeping up as crude oil supplies recently hit a year low 
furthermore  we have witnessed increases in certain construction materials such as portland cement 
it is unclear at this point in time whether we could be successful in raising margins to offset any additional costs 
one way to gain insight into this issue is examining the spread between the high and low bidders 
historically  during competitive times  spreads are typically very narrow but as demand increases and capacity tightens  spreads usually begin to widen and margins improve 
according to a recent study by dr 
thomas c 
schleifer  a noted industry economist  spreads  on an industry wide basis  are starting to widen but not to the point where pricing is necessarily improving 
granite continues to be pleased with the bidding opportunities available  both in the number and size of the potential projects to pursue 
very large  technically complex projects  contracted using the design build contract delivery method  play to our strengths 
examples of opportunities include  or have included  the hudson bergen railroad in new jersey  the interstate rehabilitation in salt lake city  utah  and the jfk light rail system in new york 
we have identified additional bidding opportunities in boston large highway and tunnel projects part of the city s central artery program  the foothill transportation corridor in orange county  and concurrently  we anticipate bidding on numerous highway and bridge projects in all our geographic markets 
bidding  in general  is up and is expected to remain robust 
as a reminder  while these are attractive projects  if awarded  their impact on granite s earnings will be felt in and beyond due to their size and the time it takes to reach the threshold of completion for profit recognition 
on march   the company announced that wasatch constructors  a joint venture of kiewit pacific company  granite construction company and morrison knudsen corp  was awarded a contract by the utah department of transportation for the i corridor reconstruction project in salt lake city  utah 
the value of the project is approximately billion 
the company s share of the joint venture is percent  or about million 
work is scheduled to start in late spring of and will be completed in late in the first half of  granite expects to complete its investment in tic through a tender offer to their employee stockholders for the remaining 
the tic investment provides an opportunity to diversify our risks through geographical expansion  increased private work and entry into a different but related construction industry sector 
finally  our financial expectations are similar to on the negative side  we will not have the successful san joaquin hills toll road in our mix of business this year  as the project was completed in the fourth quarter of we do  however  expect a positive earnings boost from emergency flood related work done early in the year in northern california and nevada 
we expect the level of competition in our branch related business to be on par with last year but we are very bullish on this year s prospects for the branch division s turn business
