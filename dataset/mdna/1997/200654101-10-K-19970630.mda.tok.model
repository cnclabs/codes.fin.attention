item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information on the results of operations for the three years ended march   and and the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources for the same three year period 
the financial statements of the company and the notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
introduction the joint venture is producing gold on a limited basis from the virgin gold ore and tailings it is extracting at the ssgm and it simultaneously is performing four separate operations 
first  it has commenced a limited production of gold by processing the ssgm tailings and now they are being blended with the virgin ore at its scmp facility which is located approximately miles from the ssgm site 
second  it is installing a pilot open pit  heap leaching gold process on the ssgm site 
third  it is continuing its ssgm site preparation  the expansion of its exploration and exploitation targets  and the enlargement and development of its gold ore reserves 
fourth  it is exploring the potential of the four gold mine prospects identified as the san felipe el potosi mine  and its extension  the el capulin mine  the hormiguero mine  the montemayor mine  and the modesto mine  all located in el salvador  central america 
concurrently  it also is in the process of obtaining the necessary funding for each of these separate operations while it continues its limited production of gold and the exploration  exploitation and development of its mining prospects 
the more than twelve year el salvador war and the general disbelief that peace will prevail had been a material deterrent in obtaining funding for the resumption of the ssgm operations and for the restoration of the scmp 
on december   through the auspices of the united nations  the end of the war was declared contingent upon a three year term to comply with all of the conditions of this pact 
presently peace prevails 
current status the company  on february   through its joint venture acquired the scmp  a precious metals leaching mill and plant which has the capacity of processing tons of virgin gold ore and precious metals ore per day 
while the joint venture did achieve at times to operate the mill to its full capacity by processing tailings  it encountered operational problems which compelled it to operate the mill at a lower production rate 
considerable time and capital was consumed to bring the scmp to a favorable operating condition 
a new labor force had to be trained to operate the scmp  mechanical problems occurred  metallurgical differences had to be resolved  the rainy hurricane season was unusually severe  the head grade varied and problems were encountered with the handling of the separation of the coarse material 
taking into account all of the factors affecting the scmp  if the joint venture had not offset all of the revenues    from the gold sales by reducing the advances to the joint venture  it would have reflected a nominal profit 
this production of gold broadens the company s objectives and now enables the company to commence a complementary operation while continuing its endeavor to obtain sufficient funds for the ssgm open pit  heap leach operation which is its major and original goal and presently is in the developmental stage 
the company s main objective and plan  through the joint venture  is to operate at the ssgm site  a moderate tonnage  low grade open pit  heap leaching  gold producing mine and it intends to commence this major gold mining operation as soon as adequate funding is in place 
dependent on the grade of gold ore processed  it then anticipates producing approximately  ounces of gold from the scmp operation and  ounces of gold from its ssgm open pit  heap leaching operation during the first twelve full operating months 
the joint venture continues to conduct an exploration program to develop additional gold ore reserves at the ssgm and at the following four other mines the san felipe el potosi  and its extension  the el capulin mine  the modesto mine  the hormiguero mine  and the montemayor mine  all located in el salvador 
since the joint venture commenced producing gold at the scmp  albeit a very exiguous operation  and a forerunner of its greater goals  the company s revenues  profitability and cash flow will be greatly influenced by the price of gold 
gold prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors which will be beyond the company s control  such as  expectations for inflation  the strength of the us dollar  overproduction of gold  global and regional demand  or political and economic conditions 
the combined effect of these factors is difficult  perhaps impossible to predict 
should the market price of gold fall below the company s production costs and remain at such level for any sustained period  the company could experience losses 
under these circumstances  the company could choose to suspend operations in order to minimize losses 
the company believes that neither it  nor any other competitor  has a material effect on the precious metal markets and that the price it will receive for its production is dependent upon world market conditions over which it has no control 
results of operation fiscal years march  compared to march  the company had a net gain of  or 
per share for its fiscal year ended march  compared to a net gain of  or 
per share for the previous fiscal year or an increase of 
this increase was attributable primarily to the additional interest income earned from the advances to the joint venture 
this fiscal year the interest earned was  compared to the prior fiscal year s interest earnings of  this gain results primarily from a charge of interest due to the advances to the joint venture which amounted to  for this period or a net increase of  from the last fiscal period which equalled  the total advances to the joint venture amounted to  but were reduced by the  revenues received from the gold sales 
likewise the company s borrowings have increased from  to  or approximately and the interest expense for has increased from  to  for the last year 
almost all of the costs and expenses incurred by the company are allocated and charged to the joint venture 
the joint venture capitalizes all of these costs and expenses and will continue to do so until such time as it resumes its gold mine operation 
at the time production commences  these capitalized costs will be charged as an expense based on a per unit basis 
if the prospect of gold production becomes unlikely  all of these costs will be written off in the year that this occurs

likewise the company s borrowings have increased from  to  or approximately and the interest expense for has increased slightly from  to  for the last year 
liquidity and capital resources the company continues to be cognizant of its cash liquidity until it is able to produce adequate profits from its gold production 
it will attempt to obtain sufficient funds to assist the joint venture in placing the ssgm into production as the anticipated scmp profits unless accumulated over a period of time will not be sufficient to meet the ssgm capital and the other mining exploration needs 
in order to continue obtaining funds to conduct the joint venture s exploration  exploitation  development  expansion programs  and the production of gold from the ssgm open pit  heap leaching operation  it may be necessary for the company to obtain funds from other sources 
the company may be required to borrow funds by issuing open ended  secured  on demand or unsecured promissory notes or by selling its shares to its directors  officers and other interested investors or by entering into a joint venture with other companies 
during the past  the joint venture was engaged in exploration  exploitation and development programs designed to increase its gold ore reserves 
the prospects of expanding the gold reserves are positive 
the funds needed by the joint venture were obtained from the company via net advances  in fiscal the company believes that these advances significantly contributed to the value of the ssgm and to the value of its other mining prospects as the results of the exploratory efforts evidence a potential substantial increase of gold ore reserves  which add value to the joint venture and to the company 
the company was able to obtain sufficient funds to retrofit the scmp  to purchase consumable inventory  to purchase certain hauling and loading equipment  to purchase a crushing system  to perform diamond drilling on the ssgm  to upgrade and for working capital use 
the company has been able to obtain the funds required for its and the joint venture s undertaking via a debt and equity structure of funding 
since september  the company and three of its wholly owned subsidiaries advanced a sum of  to the joint venture  exclusive of gold sale proceeds 
the company estimates that it will need at least us million to start a  ton per day open pit  heap leaching operation and over time to increase the production capacity to  tons per day at the ssgm 
the use of proceeds is as follows  for mining equipment and a crushing system   for the processing equipment and site and infrastructure costs  and  for the working capital 
advances to the joint venture advances to the joint venture during the company s fiscal year ended march  were derived from the various sources including related parties as follows funding sources from related other parties sources total accounts payable accruals etc 
   notes payable    equity    net income   totals    increase in cash cash equivalents   advances to the joint venture    therefore  the company continues to rely on its directors  officers  related parties and others for its funding needs 
the company believes that it will be able to obtain such short term funds as are required from the same sources as it has in the past 
in turn  then it can advance the funds required by the joint venture to continue the exploration  exploitation and development of the ssgm  and the other exploration prospects  for the operation of scmp and for other necessary company expenditures 
anticipated profits from the scmp gold production provide a limited amount of cash for corporate purposes 
it further believes that the funding needed to proceed with the continued exploration of the five exploration targets for the purpose of increasing its gold ore reserves should be million 
these programs will involve airborne geophysics  stream chemistry  geological mapping trenching and drilling 
the joint venture believes that it may be able to joint venture these exploration costs with other mining companies 
from september through march   the company has advanced to the joint venture  the sum of  and three of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries have advanced the sum of  for a total of  the funds advanced to the joint venture were used primarily for the exploration  exploitation  and development of the ssgm  for the construction of the joint venture laboratory facilities on real estate owned by the company near the ssgm site  for the operation of the laboratory  for the purchase of a ton per day used scmp precious metals cyanide leaching mill and plant  for the retrofitting  repair  modernization and expansion of its scmp facilities  for consumable inventory  for working capital to commence the production of gold  for exploration costs for the san felipe el potosi mine  and its extension  the el capulin mine  the modesto mine  the hormiguero mine  and the montemayor mine  for ssgm infrastructure  including rewiring and repairing about two miles of the company s electric lines to provide electrical service  for the purchase of equipment  laboratory chemicals  and supplies  for parts and supply inventory  for the maintenance of the company owned dam and reservoir  for extensive road extension and preservation  for its participation in the construction of a community bridge  for community telephone building and facilities  for the purchase and advance lease payment of the real estate on the modesto mine  for the purchase of a crushing system  for diamond drilling at the ssgm  and many other related needs 
scmp operations  ssgm other mine exploration items and of this report describe the company s current activities and status 
the company  through its joint venture  has reduced its advances to the company from its sale of gold  therefore  the advances reported are after deducting these gold sale proceeds 
presently the company believes that the additional equipment needed for the scmp would permit it to reach its goal of processing up to tons of virgin ore each day of operation 
in the event the joint venture s goals are reached  then the profits and cash flow should provide funds that could be used to commence the ssgm open pit  heap leaching operation 
the company estimates that it will need at least us million to start a  ton per day open pit  heap leaching operation and over time to increase the production capacity to  tons per day at the ssgm 
the profit and cash flow projections reflect that the invested capital could be recovered during the first months of full production 
it further believes that it should be able to raise adequate funds to proceed with its goals which include the scmp expansion and the installation of its crushing system 
during the last fiscal quarter ended march   the company did raise the sum of million by issuing series a convertible preferred stock and the placement of additional equity securities 
employees the joint venture employs approximately full time persons from el salvador up to persons  including part time employees to perform its exploration  exploitation  and development programs  to produce gold from its scmp facilities  and to handle the administration of its activities 
none of these employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreements 
it has developed a continuous harmonious relationship with its employees 
it believes that the joint venture is the largest single non agricultural employer in el salvador s eastern zone 
also  the company employs approximately four persons plus part time help in the united states 
insurance the joint venture has in existence insurance through an el salvador insurance company with the following general coverage general liability  vehicle liability and extended coverage  fire  explosion  hurricane  cyclone  tornado  windstorm  hail  flood  storm  earthquake  tremor or volcanic eruption  politically motivated violence  terrorism  strikes  work stoppages  riots  uprisings  malicious acts  vandalism  and related acts 
as additional equipment and assets are acquired or improvements are made  the insurance coverage will be increased accordingly 
related party loans  obligations and transactions the related party transactions are included in detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
company advances to the joint venture since september through march   the company  and three of its subsidiaries  have advanced to the joint venture  included in the total advances is the interest charged to the joint venture by the company and this charge amounts to  through march  the company furnishes all of the funds required by the joint venture 
efforts to obtain capital since the concession was granted  and through the present time  substantial effort is exercised in securing funding through various sources  all with the purpose to resume and expand the operations of the scmp and ssgm and to continue the exploration of its other mining prospects 
the company  sanseb  and the joint venture consider the past political situation in the republic of el salvador to have been unstable  and believe that the final peace declaration on december   has put an end to war 
presently  interested investors continue to be apprehensive and skeptical about the political status of the republic of el salvador and therefore continue to be hesitant to invest the funds required 
however  during the past fiscal year  the company was able to invest a gross sum of  which was reduced by the  received from the sale of gold proceeds and reflected a net investment of  into the el salvador operations 
this includes allocation of the company s expenditures 
the company believes that it will be able to obtain adequate financing from the same sources as in the past to conduct the present operations during the fiscal year ended march
