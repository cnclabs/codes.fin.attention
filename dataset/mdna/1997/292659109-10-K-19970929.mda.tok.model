item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  the company had a net loss in the year ended june  of  compared to net income of  for the year ended june  the change in profitability was primarily due to the gain on the sale of  of ovonic battery company stock in the prior year  the approximate  reduction in one time license fees in the year ended june  and the investment by the company of its own funds in the current year to develop a new family of ovonic nickel metal hydride nimh batteries 
the net loss in the year ended june  resulted primarily from investment of company funds for development of electric and hybrid vehicle batteries  decreased revenues for such development work  costs related to start up and expansion of negative electrode production equipment and initiation of positive electrode production and equipment  expenses of additional technical  manufacturing and engineering support for the gm ovonic manufacturing joint venture in furtherance of initial nimh battery production and ongoing technical assistance to other customers  development of multi state electrical memory  and costs related to defending the company s patents 
when revenue from license fees  which are non recurring and sporadic  and the gain on the sale of ovonic battery stock in  are excluded  the decrease in profitability from to is approximately  product sales increased slightly from  in the year ended june  to  in the year ended june  due to a  increase in from sales of negative and positive electrodes  offset by a  decrease in machine building revenues as a result of completion of production machinery for gm ovonic and united solar 
royalties increased from  in the year ended june  to  in the year ended june   primarily due to increases in royalties from battery technology  partially offset by decreases in royalties from phase change rewritable optical memory products  as prices of the products decreased 
see note b notes to consolidated financial statements 
royalties from licensees based in japan were also negatively impacted by the weakness in the japanese yen 
the company has audit rights to verify the amounts of royalties being reported and paid by its licensees 
the company plans to enforce these audit rights 
revenues from research and development agreements r d agreements decreased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  due to reductions in revenues recognized in government sponsored programs in photovoltaic and battery technologies 
this decrease was a result of the us government spending reduction program

the change from other income net of  in the year ended june  compared to  of other income net in the year ended june  was due principally to the  gain on the sale of ovonic battery common stock in year ended june  compared to year ended june  the company had net income in the year ended june  of  compared to net income of  for the year ended june  the change in profitability was primarily due to reduced license fees in  partially offset by a gain on the sale of ovonic battery common stock of  net income for the year ended june  was due principally to  of non recurring payments received by the company under three consumer battery agreements entered into in in settlement of an action initiated by the company with the international trade commission itc  as well as agreements with other major companies 
product sales increased from  in the year ended june  to  in the year ended june  due to increased machine building revenues for both ecd and ovonic battery and increased sales by ovonic battery of negative electrodes and battery packs to gm ovonic 
royalties increased from  which included  of royalties reported by a licensee in relating to prior periods in the year ended june  to  in the year ended june   primarily due to royalties earned for use of ecd s phase change rewritable optical memory technology 
the company has audit rights to verify the amounts of royalties being reported and paid by its licensees 
the company  based on information received  plans to enforce these audit rights 
revenues from r d agreements decreased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  due to reductions in revenues recognized under agreements in the photovoltaic and battery technologies 
see note b notes to consolidated financial statements 
the reduction in in revenues under government contracts is due to the completion of r d agreements and the us government s deficit reduction program 
revenues from license agreements decreased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  due to non recurring revenues related to agreements with three consumer battery manufacturers in settlement of the aforementioned itc action in see note b notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in other revenues was due to increased billings in for services performed by the ecd s production technology and machine building division  as well as miscellaneous work performed for ovonic battery licensees 
the increase in the cost of product sales from  in the year ended june  to  in the year ended june  was principally due to the increased machine building activities for ecd and increased sales of ovonic negative electrodes 
the decrease in cost of revenues from r d agreements in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  was principally due to decreases in activities in under the agreements with usabc  nrel and doe 
the increase in product development and research expenses from  in the year ended june  to  in the year ended june  was due to the aforementioned reduced funding under the agreements with usabc and related increased ovonic battery product development and research expenses
