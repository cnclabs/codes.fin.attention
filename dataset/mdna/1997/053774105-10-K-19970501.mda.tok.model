 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the company s current plans  options may be granted at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant and therefore no compensation expense is recognized for the stock options granted

to date  the overall impact of inflation on the company has not been material 
except for the cash receipts from the sale of coupon book memberships  the company s membership business is generally not seasonal 
most cash receipts from these coupon book memberships are received in the fourth quarter and  to a lesser extent  in the first and the third quarters of each fiscal year 
as is typical in the consumer software industry  the company s software business is highly seasonal 
net revenues and operating income are highest during the third and fourth quarters and are lowest in the first and second quarters 
this seasonal pattern is primarily due to the increased demand for the company s software products during the year end holiday selling season 
in fiscal  the company s international businesses represented less than of ebit 
operating in international markets involves dealing with sometimes volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on the company is complex because it is linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates and other factors 
because the company operates in a mix of membership services and numerous countries  management believes currency exposures are fairly well diversified 
to date  currency exposure has not been a significant competitive factor at the local market operating level 
as international operations continue to expand and the number of cross border transactions increases  the company intends to continue monitoring its currency exposures closely and take prudent actions as appropriate
