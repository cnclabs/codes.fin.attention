item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations patient revenues of the company s inpatient facilities are affected by changes in the rates the company charges  changes in reimbursement rates by third party payors  the volume of patients treated and changes in the mix of payors and patient types 
the company s facilities provide services to patients requiring intensive patient care  less intensive residential treatment care and outpatient treatment 
also  at four of the company s facilities  medical subacute services are provided 
the reimbursement rates for intensive inpatient care are generally greater than the rates paid for residential treatment care 
however  the average length of stay for patients in residential treatment programs is significantly greater than that for patients in intensive inpatient programs 
generally  charges for each facility s services are reimbursed under third party reimbursement programs at the amount billed or at rates which are less than the facility s charges 
when operating revenues charges per patient day are higher than the negotiated per diem rate or the facility s costs  the difference is recorded as a reduction of gross revenues 
these lower rates can be based on a negotiated per diem amount or based on the facility s costs as audited or projected by the third party payors 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company derived approximately of its revenues from the medicare program 
certain legislative changes enacted in july will impact the level of medicare reimbursement received by the company s facilities beginning july  see item business sources of revenue 
the company records amounts due to or from third party reimbursement sources based on its best estimates of amounts to be ultimately received or paid under cost reports filed with appropriate intermediaries 
the final determination of amounts earned under reimbursement programs is subject to review and audit by these intermediaries 
differences between amounts recorded as estimated settlements and the audited amounts are reflected as adjustments to the company s revenues in the period in which the final determination is made 
during the years ended june  and  the company recorded contractual adjustment benefits related to intermediary audits of prior year cost reports of approximately million and million  respectively 
during the year ended june   the company recorded contractual adjustment expenses related to intermediary audits of prior year cost reports of approximately million 
as a result of this negative experience  the company recorded additional contractual adjustment expenses totaling million in its june  financial statements related to possible future adjustments of its cost report estimates by intermediaries 
management believes that its revenues in future periods will not be negatively impacted by future intermediary audits of cost report settlements recorded at june  and the company also receives capitated amounts for behavioral healthcare services provided to patients covered by certain managed care contracts 
capitated revenues are recognized during the period in which enrolled lives are covered for capitated payments received 
revenue received from the management of facilities not owned by the company and for case management  utilization review and quality assurance oversight on the delivery of behavioral healthcare services by independent providers on behalf of clients is recognized at the time the services are provided 
several years ago  the federal government established a funding mechanism  known as disproportionate share  which was meant to adequately reimburse facilities serving a disproportionately high volume of medicaid patients  relative to other providers 
disproportionate share funding was established under title xix of the social security act  administered at the state level and approved overseen by the health care financing administration  since medicaid services are jointly funded by each state as well as the federal government 
in fiscal years and  the company received significant disproportionate share payments from the louisiana medicaid program 
statutory changes virtually eliminated the disproportionate share funding mechanism in louisiana and  for the years ended june  and  disproportionate share payments received by the company s louisiana facilities were not material 
the impact of louisiana disproportionate share payments on revenues and income from continuing operations in fiscal year was approximately million and million  respectively 
during fiscal year  the state of louisiana requested repayment of disproportionate share payments received by two of the company s louisiana facilities in fiscal years and totaling approximately million 
the repayment requests related to a alleged overpayments made to the company s former three rivers hospital  which was closed on june   because the state believed three rivers actual annual inpatient volume was less than its projection of annual inpatient volume made at the beginning of its cost reporting year and b alleged improper teaching hospital payments made to three rivers hospital and bayou oaks hospital because the state believed these facilities were not qualifying teaching hospitals at the time these payments were made 
the company believes that certain of the calculations which support the state s calculation have not been considered 
further  the company believes that  based on its understanding of the rules and regulations in place at the time the teaching hospital payments were made  payments received as a result of the teaching classification were appropriate 
the company believes that this matter may be settled for an amount significantly less than the state s initial requests 
any settlement of this matter will be contingent upon the execution of settlement documentation  the terms of which have not been agreed upon 
further  there can be no assurance that the company and the state will agree on a settlement amount or the terms and conditions of settlement documentation 
the company intends to vigorously contest any position by the state of louisiana which the company considers adverse and believes that adequate provision has been made at june  and for the estimated amount which might be recovered from the company as a result of this matter
