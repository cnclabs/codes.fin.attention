general in fiscal  in response to growing demand for manufactured homes  the company began developing its expansion and vertical integration plan by opening nine new retail sales centers and entering into a new venture the homestar venture with oak creek homes  inc oak creek  a long time supplier  to start up and operate two manufacturing facilities 
the costs associated with the start up of two new manufacturing facilities and the new retail sales centers had an adverse effect on the company s operating results in the second half of fiscal and in the first half of fiscal by october  both manufacturing facilities had become profitable 
effective august   a combination was consummated with the shareholders of oak creek exchanging their shares of oak creek common stock for shares of the company s common stock the combination 
in connection with the combination  all of the retail sales management personnel and manufacturing management personnel exchanged their shares of common stock in the company s subsidiaries for shares of the company s common stock 
in september  the company formed st century to originate  finance  sell and service manufactured housing sales contracts from the company and third parties 
st century is managed by two former executive officers of clayton and its finance subsidiary  vanderbilt 
the company  clayton and management of st century own  and  respectively  of the equity capital of st century 
st century commenced operations in october the company accounts for its investment in st century using the equity method of accounting  showing its proportionate share of st century s earnings or losses as earnings or loss in affiliate 
in september  the company exercised its option to acquire guerdon after managing guerdon s operations under a management agreement since march guerdon produces manufactured homes in four facilities located in oregon  idaho  nebraska and mississippi and sells its homes to over independent retailers located in states in the pacific northwest  rocky mountain and south central regions of the united states 
in september  the company acquired heartland  a single plant manufacturer of low to medium priced homes in north carolina 
concurrent with the heartland acquisition  the company also purchased the assets of manu fac  a contractually affiliated group of independent retailers  which have since become franchisees of the company 
vertical integration and internalization several elements of the company s growth strategy are based on an increasing degree of vertical integration over time 
by combining its retail and manufacturing operations in fiscal and then developing transportation  insurance and finance subsidiaries  the company potentially benefits from multiple income sources as the result of each retail sale 
increasing the degree of vertical integration will affect the company s revenues and margins in two important ways several elements of the company s growth strategy center on increasing the rate of internalization of its retail sales ie  the proportion of new homes sold by company owned retail sales centers that are manufactured by the company 
this strategy enables the company to earn both a manufacturing profit and a retailing profit on those home sales  however  only retail sales revenue is recognized 
accordingly  increasing the internalization rate without otherwise affecting the company s level of manufacturing and retailing activity has the effect of increasing gross margins and reducing reported revenues  however  aggregate gross profit in dollars is not materially affected by changes in the internalization rate 
another key element of the company s growth strategy is to increase the degree of retail penetration of its financial services 
as insurance product penetration increases  both reported revenues and earnings should increase without a corresponding increase in retail unit sales 
similarly  as st century finances more of the company s retail sales  the company s earnings should increase without a corresponding increase in retail unit sales 
the recent acquisitions of heartland  guerdon and brilliant will have the effect of adding significant revenues to the company with little  if any  immediate benefit from vertical integration 
those benefits should reflect gradually  over time  as the company executes its vertical integration strategy in the new regional markets which these acquisitions encompass

this increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of new and previously owned homes sold at retail as well as a increase in the average selling price of new homes 
the decline in the average new homes sold per retail sales center from in fiscal to in fiscal was attributable to unusually wet weather conditions during the past winter and spring in the south and southwest regions of the united states  which delayed the opening of several retail sales centers from the company s third quarter to the fourth quarter  as well as an increase in the number of retailers operating in texas and surrounding states 
however  average sales revenue in fiscal per retail sales center remained level with fiscal as the company increased the percentage of multi section homes sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal

the company added ten new retail sales centers during fiscal in response to continuing increases in demand for new manufactured homes in texas and surrounding states 
the decline in the average new homes sold per retail sales center was primarily attributable to a temporary change in lending practices among the company s outside retail lenders arising from the company s announcement of the formation of its own lending affiliate  st century  in september to a lesser degree  average new home sales per retail sales center were also affected by a change in sales mix with a higher proportion of multi section homes and by certain retail management changes in september total manufacturing shipments for fiscal increased from fiscal consistent with the company s vertical integration plan  however  shipments to independent dealers declined by  as more company manufactured homes were directed to company owned retail sales centers

the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  expressed as a percentage of total revenues  was primarily the result of an increase in the internalization rate  fixed costs of new company owned retail sales centers that had not yet reached normal operating efficiency  increased warranty and service expenses  increased advertising and the addition of administrative personnel in response to significant increases in business activity 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in floor plan indebtedness throughout most of the fiscal year to support a higher level of sales and inventory and the addition of million in long term debt in june used to finance the purchase of two manufacturing plants and one retail sales center  all formerly under lease by the company 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations of  in fiscal decreased from million in fiscal net income before depreciation and amortization was offset by substantial increases in inventory required to open new company owned retail sales centers 
an important part of the company s growth strategy is to expand the number of company owned retail sales centers and increase its manufacturing production 
management estimates the capital required to open a new retail sales center to be approximately million to million  primarily for inventory and working capital 
management currently plans to open or acquire to retail sales centers each year for the next two years and  in connection therewith  will use cash to purchase inventory and operating assets and for working capital purposes 
management expects increased cash generated by company owned retail sales centers and manufacturing operations to substantially fund the working capital required to open new company owned retail sales centers 
in fiscal  the company paid approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired  to purchase guerdon  heartland  certain operating assets of manu fac and three retail sales centers 
total tangible assets purchased were million with total liabilities assumed of million  giving rise to million in goodwill 
in addition  the company had capital expenditures of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  the company financed million to acquire five manufacturing plants formerly under lease by the company 
the remaining expenditures were used primarily to fund new company owned retail sales centers and additions to manufacturing capacity 
at may   the company had a million floor plan credit facility with ford consumer finance company  inc ford with an interest rate at prime 
the facility is similar to a revolving credit facility and is used to finance the purchase of inventory of new homes at company owned retail sales centers 
in order to satisfy greater working capital requirements and to fund capital expenditures in connection with the company s expanding operations  the company increased its gross borrowings under the facility by million in fiscal at may   the company had net borrowings under the credit facility of million gross borrowings of million  less participations of million 
the company s participations in its floor plan credit facility earn interest at the lender s prime rate less 
and are immediately available to the company in cash 
beginning in july  amounts available to the company under the ford credit facility were increased to million 
amounts outstanding under this credit facility will bear interest at prime less with the company s participations in such credit facility earning interest at prime less 
on july   the company completed the private placement of million of senior unsecured notes with an average life of years and a final maturity in july the senior notes 
the company used the net proceeds to repay approximately million in existing secured bank debt and approximately million in secured debt of its recently acquired subsidiary  brilliant holding corporation 
the remainder of the proceeds will be used to temporarily reduce borrowings under the company s floor plan credit facility with ford 
total funded debt  including floor plan  expressed as a percentage of equity  increased from at may   to at may   principally the result of acquisitions of manufacturing facilities in several new market regions 
as the company continues to explore strategic acquisition opportunities in new regions  the company s leverage may further increase 
management believes that the proceeds from the senior notes  when coupled with the company s increased floor plan facility and cash provided by operations  will be sufficient to satisfy working capital and capital expenditure requirements over the next two years 
inflation and seasonality inflation in recent years has been modest and has primarily affected the company s manufacturing costs in the areas of labor  manufacturing overhead and raw materials other than lumber 
the price of lumber is affected more by the imbalances between supply and demand than by inflation 
historically  the company believes it has been able to minimize the effects of inflation by increasing the selling prices of its products  improving its manufacturing efficiency and increasing its employee productivity 
in addition  the company s business is seasonal  with weakest demand typically occurring during the company s third fiscal quarter december through february and the strongest demand typically occurring during the company s last fiscal quarter march through may 
over the history of the company s operations  management has not observed any correlation between interest rate fluctuations and increases or decreases in sales based solely on such fluctuations 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share sfas was issued 
sfas replaces accounting principles board opinion no 
 earnings per share apb and specifies the computation  presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings per share eps 
sfas replaces the presentation of primary eps under apb with basic eps and fully diluted eps under apb with diluted eps 
the company does not believe the adoption of sfas in fiscal will have a significant impact on reported earnings per share
