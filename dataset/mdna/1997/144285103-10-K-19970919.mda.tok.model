item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion of operations summary net sales and earnings trends for the past three fiscal years are summarized below in millions except per share net sales net income primary earnings per share net sales increased to a record level in fiscal primarily as a result of including the operations of dynamet since its acquisition on february   and increased sales of ceramic products and of the mexican steel distribution operations 
net income was unchanged in fiscal as the favorable effects from the inclusion of dynamet  the improved ceramic sales and lower losses related to the reduced investment in walsin cartech were offset by higher specialty alloys operations environmental costs and extended maintenance shutdown costs at the beginning of fiscal primary earnings per common share decreased from a year ago because of increased common shares outstanding 
net sales and earnings increased in fiscal as a result of a strong market for specialty metals  selling price increases  an improved product mix and cost reduction efforts 
the chart below shows net sales by product line for the past three fiscal years in millions sales sales sales stainless steel special alloys tool and other steel ceramics and other materials titanium products total results of operations fiscal versus fiscal net sales were million in fiscal  a percent increase from the million level in fiscal a majority of the increase resulted from the inclusion of dynamet s sales since acquisition 
increased sales of ceramic products  an improved mix of specialty alloys operations products and increased sales of the mexican steel distribution operations also added to the higher sales level in fiscal unit volume of specialty alloys operations products was unchanged from a year ago

unit selling prices remained relatively constant during fiscal cost of sales as a percentage of sales was percent in both years 
in fiscal  lower specialty alloys operations raw material costs were offset by higher labor  energy  maintenance shutdown and environmental costs 
specialty alloys operations raw material costs per unit purchased decreased by percent during fiscal versus the year earlier costs as a result of decreases in the cost of cobalt percent  nickel percent  and chromium percent 
also  the purchase premium for semi finished and finished products to supplement internal capacity was lower in fiscal labor costs per hour for specialty alloys operations production and maintenance employees were up by percent principally as a result of a base wage increase in july which was partially offset by lower profit sharing costs

unit volume of specialty alloys operations products was slightly higher than in fiscal demand for specialty steel products was at a high level  especially in automotive  aerospace  and chemical and petroleum processing related products 
unit selling prices for specialty steel shipments increased by an average of percent to offset higher labor and other costs and to restore profit margins which had eroded in prior years 
a raw material surcharge was established in fiscal to offset sharply rising raw material costs 
the product mix shifted toward more premium melted products and away from certain commodity priced products

higher specialty alloys operations raw material  labor and other costs were offset by increased selling prices 
raw material costs per unit purchased increased by percent during fiscal versus the year earlier costs as a result of increases in the cost of nickel percent  chromium percent and cobalt percent 
also  in both fiscal years  carpenter purchased at a premium semi finished and finished products to supplement internal capacity 
labor costs per hour for specialty alloys operations production and maintenance employees were up by percent  principally as a result of a base wage increase in july and higher profit sharing costs  partially offset by lower medical costs and higher pension credits 
specialty alloys operations natural gas costs per unit consumed decreased by percent versus fiscal costs  and electricity costs per unit decreased by percent
