the gross profit margin decrease was primarily attributable to the cost of shipping products from the united states to the united kingdom to meet customer demand in excess of the uk plant capacity in the first half of increased capacity utilization in both the united states and united kingdom offset the impact of yet lower average selling prices in while general  selling and administrative expenses have increased from to and from to  the rate of increase is less than the rate of increase in sales 
much of the increased cost has been directed to research and development of new products unrelated to the current markets served 
the company aggressively expanded its capacity to produce absorbent polymers from to the company began the three year period with worldwide capacity of  metric tons  and ended with  metric tons 
the company s production capability is presently among the largest in the world 
the expansions were undertaken ahead of the industry demand curve
