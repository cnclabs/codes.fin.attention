item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the death care industry in the united states is undergoing a transition in which many family owned firms are consolidating with larger organizations such as the company 
in addition  the company believes that this trend has now begun to evolve in other countries  particularly in europe  canada  australia  new zealand and mexico 
although the company s future participation in this consolidation cannot be guaranteed  the company believes that it has been successful in identifying and acquiring firms that have enhanced shareholder value  and it will continue to explore expansion opportunities in foreign countries  although it expects most of its expansion to continue to occur in the united states 
two other trends affecting the death care industry are the death rate and average age of the population 
industry studies indicate that while the death rate is declining slightly  the average age of the population is increasing 
this is expected to result in a long term  small  though stable  increase in the number of deaths  despite short term deviations 
more importantly  because of the company s emphasis on prearranged sales  it anticipates that the aging of the population will create additional opportunities for the company to expand its customer base since the principal market for these prearranged services is the more mature and fastest growing segment of the population 
the company s funeral and cemetery business includes prearranged sales funded through trust and escrow arrangements  as well as maintenance of cemetery grounds funded through perpetual care funds 
the company s investment strategy for these funds is partially dependent on the ability to withdraw net realized capital gains from these funds 
such withdrawal is not permitted for perpetual care funds in certain jurisdictions in which the company operates 
accordingly  funds for which net capital gains are permitted to be withdrawn typically are invested in a diversified portfolio consisting principally of us government securities  other interest bearing securities and preferred stocks rated a or better  publicly traded common stocks  money market funds and other short term investments 
the company recognizes as revenue on a current basis all dividends and interest earned and realized capital gains including capital gains in perpetual care funds from which net realized capital gains may be withdrawn  from the sale of securities held in trust funds and escrow accounts 
the composition of trust and escrow income from funds  especially those including common stock  can be materially affected by prevailing interest rates and the performance of the stock market 
in managing its domestic funds  including those in puerto rico  which include investments in common stock  the company seeks an overall annual rate of return within a range of 
in the past three years  such funds have generated overall annual rates of return that approximate that range 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in achieving any particular rate of return

forward looking statements are based on assumptions about future events and are therefore inherently uncertain  actual results may differ materially from those projected 
see cautionary statements  below 
cautionary statements the company cautions readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual consolidated results and could cause the company s actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the projections made in the forward looking statements above and in any other forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
achieving projected revenue growth depends upon sustaining the level of acquisition activity experienced by the company in the last three fiscal years 
higher levels of acquisition activity will increase anticipated revenues  and lower levels of acquisition activity will decrease anticipated revenues 
the level of acquisition activity depends not only on the number of properties acquired  but also on the size of the acquisitions  for example  one large acquisition could increase substantially the level of acquisition activity and  consequently  revenues 
several important factors  among others  affect the company s ability to consummate acquisitions a the company may be unable to find a sufficient number of businesses for sale at prices the company is willing to pay 
b in most of its existing markets and in many new markets  including foreign markets  that the company desires to enter  the company competes for acquisitions with two other public companies that are substantially larger than the company 
these competitors  and others  may be willing to pay higher prices for businesses than the company or may cause the company to pay more to acquire a business than the company would otherwise have to pay in the absence of such competition 
thus  the aggressiveness of the company s competitors in pricing acquisitions affects the company s ability to complete acquisitions at prices it finds attractive 
c achieving the company s projected acquisition activity depends on the company s ability to enter new markets  including foreign markets 
due in part to the company s lack of experience operating in new areas and to the presence of competitors who have been in certain markets longer than the company  such entry may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated by the company 
the level of revenues also is affected by the volume and prices of the properties  products and services sold 
the annual sales targets set by the company are very aggressive  and the inability of the company to achieved planned increases in volume or prices could cause the company not to meet anticipated levels of revenue 
the ability of the company to achieve volume or price increases at any location depends on numerous factors  including the local economy  the local death rate and competition 
another important component of revenue is earnings from the company s trust funds and escrow accounts  which are determined by the size of  and returns which include dividends  interest and realized capital gains on  the funds 
the performance of the funds is related primarily to market conditions that are not within the company s control 
the size of the funds depends on the level of sales  funds added through acquisitions and the amount of returns that may be reinvested 
future revenue also is affected by the level of prearranged sales in prior periods 
the level of prearranged sales may be adversely affected by numerous factors  including deterioration in the economy  which causes individuals to have less discretionary income 
the company cannot predict whether or when a non cash charge to earnings may be required in connection with its performance based stock options 
see incentive compensation plan in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item herein 
the company first entered foreign markets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and no assurance can be given that the company will continue to be successful in expanding in foreign markets or that any expansion in foreign markets will yield results comparable to those realized as a result of the company s expansion in the united states 
in addition to the factors discussed above  earnings per share may be affected by other important factors  including the following a the ability of the company to achieve projected economies of scale in markets where it has clusters or combined facilities 
b whether acquired businesses perform at pro forma levels used by management in the valuation process 
c the ability of the company to manage its growth in terms of implementing internal controls and information gathering systems and retaining or attracting key personnel  among other things 
d the amount and rate of growth in the company s corporate general and administrative expenses 
e changes in interest rates  which can increase or decrease the amount the company pays on borrowings with variable rates of interest 
f the company s debt to equity ratio  the number of shares of common stock outstanding and the portion of the company s debt that has fixed or variable interest rates 
g the impact on the company s financial statements of nonrecurring accounting charges that may result from the company s ongoing evaluation of its business strategies  asset valuations and organizational structures 
h changes in government regulation  including tax rates and structures 
i unanticipated outcomes of legal proceedings 
j changes in accounting policies and practices adopted voluntarily or required to be adopted by generally accepted accounting principles
