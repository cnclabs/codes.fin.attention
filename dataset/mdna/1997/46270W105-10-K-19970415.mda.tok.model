following the initial sale  these systems become part of the installed base and generate follow on sales of supplies and service necessary for their operation 
the company also generates revenues from sales of ancillary lines of small laboratory instruments and supplies 
until recently  the company generated most of its revenues from sales of two models of the yellow iris urinalysis workstation and related supplies and services 
these two models differ mainly by their speed and price 
in  the company introduced a third model of the yellow iris 
the model udx urine pathology system  the latest in the yellow iris family  is a higher capacity automated urinalysis workstation designed especially for the high volume testing requirements of large hospitals and reference laboratories 
the company received fda clearance to market the model udx in march and began sales in may of that year 
the company also received fda clearance to market the white iris leukocyte differential analyzer in may and expects to start sales of this system in finally  the company began selling the powergene family of genetic analyzers in august after completing the psi acquisition

recent acquisitions and other significant developments since january   the company has completed several important acquisitions and announced several other significant developments 
the following is a brief summary of those developments 
the company acquired statspin in february in a pooling of interests transaction 
statspin manufacturers and markets special purpose centrifuges and related supplies for the clinical laboratory market 
in march  the company purchased the censlide system and related products for centrifugal urine sedimentation and manual microscopic examination from urohealth systems  inc for  the company completed the psi acquisition in july for approximately million plus a five year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  thereby adding the powergene genetic analyzer to its line of ivd imaging systems 
the company financed the acquisition with i a million subordinated note the subordinated note  ii a million term loan the term loan and iii million drawn under a new million revolving line of credit the credit facility 
in september  the company repurchased  shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock for million from an affiliate of bmc 
the company has paid the first two installments of the purchase price  and the remaining payments  totaling million  are due in the second half of the stock repurchase debt 
the company has the right  if necessary  to extend the due dates of the remaining installments by one year each  but must pay interest during the extension periods 
in response to a third quarter operating loss  the company restructured its workforce during the fourth quarter of and reduced the number of employees by approximately 
in september  the company filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for an underwritten public offering 
the net proceeds of the public offering were to be used primarily to reduce outstanding indebtedness incurred to finance the psi acquisition and to pay the stock repurchase debt 
following the third quarter operating loss  the company elected not to pursue the public offering and  as an alternative  to pursue one or more smaller financing transactions 
most of the expenses of the offering  totaling  were charged to operations in the third quarter of on december   the company completed a private sale of series a preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock for approximately million to the thermo amex convertible growth fund i  lp as a result of the decision not to pursue the public offering and its recent operating losses  the company was unable to comply with the financial covenants in the term loan and the credit facility on september and december  the inability to comply with these covenants constituted an event of default under the terms of the loan documents 
in april  the bank agreed to waive the default  amend the financial covenants and extend the maturity of both loans to april  for a detailed description of the above events  see business recent acquisitions and other significant developments 
results of operations the consolidated financial statements of the company contained in this report have been retroactively restated for all periods presented to include the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of statspin in accordance with the pooling of interests method of accounting 
the consolidated financial statements also reflect the consummation of the psi acquisition on july  which was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  include the financial results of psi from the date of acquisition  july  comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
sales of ivd imaging systems increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to the addition of the powergene family of genetic analyzers to the company s product line in august as a result of the psi acquisition 
the company believes that the ongoing consolidation in the healthcare industry may be adversely affecting sales of the yellow iris as some hospitals and reference laboratories appear to be postponing large capital investment decisions due to the resulting uncertainty 
the company also believes that there is a growing trend among potential customers for the yellow iris toward leasing these systems on a cost per test basis rather than purchasing them 
this trend is expected to spread the revenue from system placements over several years 
sales of ivd imaging system supplies and service increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the prior year  due to the larger installed base of ivd imaging systems and the conversion of the yellow iris installed base to the new chemstrip iristrip urine test strips marketed exclusively by the company 
as of december   the company had converted more than of this installed base from test strips marketed by various distributors to the new strips 
sales of small instruments and supplies increased to million from million  an increase of million or  over the prior year 
the increase reflects generally higher sales levels of the statspin products  as well as the addition of the censlide product line in march cost of goods for ivd imaging systems increased as a percentage of sales of ivd imaging systems to for the year ended december  from for the prior year due primarily to the addition of the model udx to the product line and amortization of increased fixed costs for ivd imaging systems 
these factors were partially offset by the addition of the higher margin powergene family of genetic analyzers to the company s product line in august although the model udx currently has a lower gross margin than other models of the yellow iris due to an oem component on which the company recognizes minimal gross margin  the company expects the model udx to generate higher sales of chemstrip iristrips and other supplies 
cost of goods for ivd imaging system supplies and service increased as a percentage of sales of such products to for the year ended december  from for the prior year primarily due to relatively lower gross margins on sales of chemstrip iristrip urine test strips which accounted for a greater proportion of sales of system supplies  as well as a decline in gross margins on service of ivd imaging systems 
cost of goods for small instruments and supplies decreased as a percentage of sales of small instruments and supplies to for the year ended december  from for the prior year due to an overall change in product mix toward higher gross margin items 
the net result of these changes was a decrease in aggregate gross margin to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
marketing and selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related travel expenses of the company s direct sales force  as well as salaries for the marketing and distributor relations departments 
marketing and selling expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million  an increase of million or over the prior period  and increased as a percentage of net sales to from  due to the addition of the sales force from the psi acquisition and increased spending on promotions  telemarketing and customer support 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll costs associated with the company s management and support personnel  facilities related costs and legal and accounting fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million  an increase of million or over the prior year  and increased as a percentage of net sales from to 
net research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for the development of new products and improvements to existing products less third party reimbursements under joint development programs  grants and research and development contracts 
net research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million  an increase of  or over the prior year  and increased as a percentage of net sales to from 
reimbursements under joint development programs increased to million from  total product technology expenditures increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the prior year  due primarily to work on the model udx and the white iris  as well as the addition of research and development staff from the psi acquisition 
amortization of intangible assets reflects the amortization of deferred expenses for warrants issued in connection with joint development projects and intangible assets arising from acquisitions and patents 
amortization of intangible assets for the year ended december  increased to  from  an increase of  or over the prior year  primarily as a result of the acquisition of intangible assets in the psi acquisition  as further described below 
the results of operations for the year ended december  include certain unusual charges to earnings of million primarily for the write off of deferred offering costs  litigation expenses  restructuring charges  and merger related expenses 
acquisition of in process research and development for the year ended december  reflects the psi acquisition which resulted in a non recurring charge of million 
acquisition of in process research and development for the year ended december  reflects the acquisition of lda which resulted in a non recurring  non cash charge of million 
the fda cleared the white iris  acquired from lda  in may interest income consists of income from investments and decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the comparable period  primarily as the result of decreased amounts of invested cash during interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the comparable period due to the indebtedness incurred to finance the psi acquisition 
the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the company recognized a deferred tax benefit of million in due to a significant reduction in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this reduction in the valuation allowance resulted principally from the company s assessment of the realizability of its net operating loss carryforwards based on recent operating history 
at december   the company increased the valuation allowance by  based on an assessment of operating results and other factors 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the future if estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period decrease 
the above factors contributed to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  as compared to net income of million  or per share  for the year ended december  excluding the charges for the acquisition of in process research and development from the psi acquisition and the million of unusual charges discussed above  the company would have had a net loss of approximately million  or per share  for the year ended december  excluding the charges for the acquisition of in process research and development from lda and the recognition of the tax benefit due to the reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  the company would have had net income of approximately million  or per share  for the year ended december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission recently announced a new position on accounting for convertible preferred stock which is potentially convertible at a discount to the market price of the common stock  even if the potential for a discount is only a possibility 
the staff has taken the position that  solely for purposes of calculating earnings per share  the potential discount is an embedded dividend to the preferred stockholders which reduces the amount of income available to common stockholders 
as a result of the staff s new accounting position  the issuance of the series a preferred stock could result in a reduction in earnings per share of up to in the first quarter of the staff s position is limited to the calculation of earnings per share and will not have any effect on the company s net income or cash flow 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net sales increased to million for from million for  an increase of million or 
sales of ivd imaging systems decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of  or from the prior year due to the sale of fewer systems in sales of ivd imaging system supplies and service increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the prior year  due to the larger installed base of ivd imaging systems and the introduction of the new chemstrip iristrip urine test strips in late sales of small instruments and supplies increased to million from million  an increase of  or 
the increase reflects generally higher sales of the statspin product line and the addition of the biovation product line in march cost of goods for ivd imaging systems as a percentage of sales of ivd imaging systems totaled for  the same as for cost of goods for ivd imaging system supplies and service decreased as a percentage of sales of ivd imaging system supplies and service to for from for due to a decrease in service costs  offset to some extent by lower gross margins on the chemstrip iristrip urine test strips 
cost of goods for small instruments and supplies decreased as a percentage of sales of small instruments and supplies to for from for due to higher gross margins on the recently added biovation product line as well as improved gross margins on the statspin product lines due to increased sales volume 
the net result of these changes and the overall change in product mix was an increase in gross margin to for from for marketing and selling expenses increased to million for from million for  an increase of  or  due to increased spending on direct sales and after sales support  and increased as a percentage of net sales to from 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for  an increase of  or  and increased as a percentage of net sales from in to in net research and development expenses increased to million for from  for  an increase of  or  and also increased as a percentage of net sales to from 
the increase in net research and development expenses was due principally to a decrease in reimbursements under research and development contracts and increased spending by the company on the continued development of the white iris 
reimbursements under research and development contracts and joint development programs decreased to  from million  a decrease of  or  due to the acquisition of lda 
total product technology expenditures increased to million from million  an increase of  or  reflecting the addition of two new research projects  a modest increase in general research and development activity and continuing expenditures by the company on the white iris to complete its development and pursue fda clearance 
amortization of intangible assets for the year ended december  increased to  from  an increase of  or over the prior year  primarily as a result of the acquisition of the digital refractometer product line of biovation  inc during the first quarter of interest income increased to  for from  for the prior year  primarily the result of increased amounts of invested cash during as a result of the exercise of outstanding warrants issued in connection with the formation of lda and stock sales to employees under the company s stock option and purchase plans 
interest expense consisted of interest incurred on notes issued by statspin and decreased to  for from  for the prior year due to a reduction in the outstanding principal balances 
other income consisted principally of royalties for sales of licensed products and remained constant at  for and acquisition of in process research and development in reflects the acquisition of lda which resulted in a non recurring  non cash charge of million 
the income tax benefit for was million as compared to a  provision in the company recognized a deferred tax benefit of million in due to a significant reduction in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this reduction in the valuation allowance resulted principally from the company s assessment of the realizability of its net operating loss carryforwards based on recent operating history 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the future if estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period decrease 
net income increased to million  or per share  for as compared to net income of million  or per share  for excluding the effects of the non recurring charge for the acquisition of in process research and development and the recognition of the tax benefit due to the reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  the company would have had net income of approximately million  or per share  for liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease is primarily attributable to operating losses  acquisition expenses  increased levels of inventory and accounts receivable and additions to plant and equipment 
inventory levels during increased to million from million

on december   the company completed a private sale of series a preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock for approximately million to the thermo amex convertible growth fund i  lp see business recent acquisitions and other significant developments issuance of preferred stock 
the company financed the purchase price for the psi acquisition with the subordinated note million  the term loan million and the credit facility million 
the term loan and credit facility impose certain operating and financial covenants on the company 
due to an inability to comply with these financial covenants  the company was in default on both loans at september and december  during the first quarter of  the bank waived the default  amended the financial covenants and extended the maturity of both loans 
in exchange  the company agreed to increase the interest rates on both loans and to issue the bank a three year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
the company also agreed to issue additional warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at prevailing market prices on each of june and july  if the term loan is still outstanding on those dates 
the following discussion reflects the amendments to the term loan and credit facility 
see business recent acquisitions and other significant developments amendment to bank loan agreements 
on december   the outstanding principal balance of the term loan was million 
since that date  the company has reduced the outstanding principal balance of the term loan to million  in large part with the net proceeds from the sale of the series a preferred stock 
see business recent acquisitions and other significant developments issuance of preferred stock 
the term loan is collateralized by a first priority lien on all the assets of the company and bears interest monthly at the bank s prime rate on april  plus 
the interest rate increases an additional percentage points on each of june and july  the company is required to pay  of principal each month  and the balance is due april  the company may prepay the term loan at any time without premium or penalty 
the outstanding principal balance on the credit facility was million on december  under the terms of the credit facility  the company can borrow and reborrow up to a maximum principal amount of million at a variable interest rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus 
the interest rate increases an additional percentage points on each of june and july  if the term loan is still outstanding on those dates 
the credit facility  collateralized by a first priority lien on all assets  matures april  the outstanding principal balance on the subordinated note was million on december  the subordinated note bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum payable in quarterly installments 
the entire principal is due on or before july  the company may prepay the subordinated note at any time without premium or penalty 
upon the issuance by the company of equity securities generating net proceeds in excess of million  the company must apply fifty percent of the excess to the prepayment of the subordinated note 
the payment of principal and interest on the subordinated note is subordinated in right of payment  to the extent and in the manner provided therein  to the prior payment in full of all indebtedness to city national bank 
the default under the term loan and credit facility did not cause a default under the subordinated note because the bank did not accelerate the maturity of the term loan or the credit facility 
on december   the outstanding balance of the stock repurchase debt was approximately million 
the company has since paid the second of four installments  and the remaining installments  due in the second half of  total million 
the company has the right  if necessary  to extend the due dates of the remaining installments by one year each  but must pay interest during the extension periods 
see business recent acquisitions and other significant developments stock repurchase 
in march  the company purchased the censlide system and related products for manual microscopic examination for  see business recent acquisitions censlide acquisition 
the company believes that its current cash on hand plus short term investments  together with cash generated by operations  will be sufficient to fund normal operations and pay interest on outstanding debt obligations for at least the next year 
however  there can be no assurance that these goals will be achieved 
the company is presently pursuing additional financing to repay outstanding principal on its long term indebtedness and to fund its long term business strategy 
there can be no assurance that the company can secure adequate additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
if the company is unable to obtain the necessary financing during the next twelve months  the company will have to pursue an arrangement with its creditors to restructure its long term indebtedness and revise its long term business strategy 
additional outside financing or a restructuring of existing indebtedness could result in dilution to holders of common stock and significant financial and operational restrictions on the company 
in september  the company and poly entered into a research and development agreement to develop the poly products using the company s technology 
the company is funding the first  per month up to a maximum of  of the cost of the project  and poly is reimbursing the company for the excess 
the company has an option until days after termination of the agreement with poly to acquire all of the common stock of poly for an aggregate price increasing on august  from million to million payable in cash or shares of common stock of the company 
if the company elects to exercise its option  the portion of the net cost of the acquisition allocated to completed products would be capitalized and its subsequent amortization would impact future earnings 
for the portion of the net cost of the acquisition allocated to in process research and development  the company would record a nonrecurring  noncash if purchased with common stock  charge against then current earnings 
see business research and development 
inflation the company does not foresee any material impact on its operations from inflation 
healthcare reform policies in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major changes in the healthcare system  nationally  at the state level or both 
future legislation  regulation or payment policies of medicare  medicaid  private health insurance plans  health maintenance organizations and other third party payors could adversely affect the demand for the company s current or future products and its ability to sell its products on a profitable basis 
moreover  healthcare legislation is an area of extensive and dynamic change  and the company cannot predict future legislative changes in the healthcare field or their impact on its business
