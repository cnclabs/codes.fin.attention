competition gaming machines and gaming of all types are available in nevada in casinos and hotel casinos  as well as in locations similar to those of jackpot  all of which compete directly or indirectly with jackpot 
jackpot has been and is subject to substantial direct competition for the operation of gaming machines in approved locations from numerous small gaming machine route operators and some large operators  located principally in las vegas  reno and their surrounding areas 
management believes at least one of these competitors has more gaming machines or locations than jackpot 
in addition  a limited number of these competitors manufacture gaming machines 
the principal methods of competition for gaming machine locations are the lease  sublease  license or revenue sharing terms  the service provided by the route operator and the experience  reputation and financial strength of the route operator 
in recent years jackpot has faced increased competition in its gaming machine route operations  and as certain of its licenses  leases and subleases have begun to expire  it has faced strong competition from other route operators who have attempted or captured locations by offering more favorable terms to retail store owners 
as a result of such competition  along with the company s continual evaluation of leases and strict adherence to management s pricing guidelines  revenues generated from route operations  which are attributable to revenue sharing contracts  have decreased from million in to million in for additional information concerning jackpot s operations  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas establishes additional standards for segment reporting in the financial statements 
management has not determined the extent of the disclosure required by sfas overview jackpot has a significant amount of its route operations at retail stores which are part of a group of affiliated store chains 
route operations from two groups of affiliated store chains in  and each accounted for more than of jackpot s total revenues in such fiscal years 
the largest six store chains albertson s  inc  american drug stores  inc  kmart corporation  lucky stores  inc  thrifty payless  inc 
and warehouse markets  inc accounted for approximately of jackpot s total revenues in the renewal or extension of agreements with such customers have generally resulted in increased monthly fees 
these contracts often require fixed periodic increases in monthly fees during the term of the contract 
with respect to the accounting treatment of fixed periodic increases in monthly fees associated with these contracts  the company is required to average annual lease costs over the term of the contract 
as a result of such accounting treatment  annual lease costs generally increase significantly in the first year of an extended contract for the respective locations covered by the contract and  thereafter  remain constant for existing locations during the term of the contract 
in  jackpot entered into agreements for long term contract extensions  which became effective july   with four of its largest retail chain store customers  two of which were not due to expire on june  a very competitive pricing environment caused the company to offer significant increases in location rent over the existing agreements 
such agreements provide jackpot the continued right to operate gaming machines at certain existing locations and future locations  if any  of such customers 
as of june   these agreements involve the operation of approximately  gaming machines in locations 
despite a long term relationship with warehouse markets  inc jackpot was not willing to agree with the terms sought for a contract extension  which management believed were uneconomic 
the agreement  which expired on june   involved the operation of approximately gaming machines in locations 
in  jackpot generated approximately of its total revenues and a significant amount of operating income from operations at such customer s locations 
with respect to  the company s results of operations will be adversely affected compared to due to the intensely competitive market conditions prevailing for gaming machine route operators  the loss of a significant chain store customer described above and to significant increases in location rent  effective july   in connection with long term contract renewals with four of jackpot s largest chain store customers 
however  management believes that the following may lessen the adverse effects described above i increased revenues at existing locations as a result of the maturing of several recently opened new chain store locations  ii additional revenues from new locations scheduled to be opened by jackpot s largest chain store customers  iii increased revenues at existing locations due to capital improvements or replacements of gaming machines  and iv certain cost reductions based on potential improvements to current operating information systems 
while management believes that these events will occur  they are  in part  based upon factors that are outside the company s control 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that such benefits will occur
