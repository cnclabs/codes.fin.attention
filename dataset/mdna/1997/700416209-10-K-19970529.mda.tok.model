item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
park is a leading global designer and producer of advanced electronic materials used to fabricate complex multilayer printed circuit boards  semiconductor packages and other electronic interconnect systems 
the company s customers for its advanced printed circuit materials include leading independent circuit board fabricators and large electronic equipment manufacturers in the computer  telecommunications  transportation  aerospace and instrumentation industries 
the company s electronic materials operations accounted for approximately of net sales worldwide and more than of operating profit in each of the last three fiscal years 
the company s foreign electronic materials operations accounted for approximate ly of net sales worldwide for each of the last two fiscal years and approximately for the fiscal year 
park is also engaged in the engineered materials and plumbing hardware business  which consists of the company s specialty adhesive tape business  its advanced composite business and its plumbing hardware business  all of which operate as independent business units 
this segment accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales worldwide and less than of operating profit in each of the last three fiscal years 
the company s sales growth during the last three fiscal years has been led by strong growth in sales by its north american and asian electronic materials operations 
during the last two fiscal years  increased sales by the company s european operations have also contributed to this growth 
the company s ongoing efforts to expand its higher technology  higher margin product lines have contributed to the growth of the company s sales of electronic materials during this period 
the company introduced several new electronic materials products during the and fiscal years 
sales volume of the company s electronic materials segment has increased during each of the last three fiscal years 
however  growth of the company s electronic materials business was interrupted in the first quarter of the fiscal year by an abrupt and unexpected weakening of the market for the company s products which continued until the fourth quarter when the market strengthened 
in addition  growth of the company s electronic materials business was constrained during the fiscal year and the fourth quarter of the fiscal year by the company s available manufacturing capacity 
during the fiscal year  the company expanded its manufacturing capacity in new york and arizona and commenced commercial operations in both locations during the early part of the fiscal year 
the company further expanded the manufacturing capacity of its facilities in arizona and singapore during the later part of the fiscal year and is planning additional expansions of its electronic materials operations in the fiscal year 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s electronic materials business was responsible for the decline in the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  the north american  european and asian markets for sophisti cated printed circuit materials experienced weakness during the first half of the fiscal year which continued into the third quarter in the north american and european markets 
the company believes this weakness was principally attributable to an industry wide inventory correction that began in the first quarter 
during the fiscal year  the company s electronic materials business experienced inefficiencies caused by operating its facilities at levels significantly lower than their designed manufacturing capacity in the first three quarters and faced price pressure from its customers resulting in an inability to pass along raw material cost increases which it received earlier in the current year 
these factors adversely affected the company s margins 
the company s performance during the fiscal year was also adversely affected by significant disruptions of the company s business with its largest customer  delco electronics corporation  caused by the canadian auto workers and united auto workers strikes against general motors in the first and third quarters of the fiscal year 
the improvement in the company s margins in the second quarter over the first quarter was achieved from internal operating adjustments in response to the industry downturn that occurred in the first quarter and the return of delco electronics to more normal business levels after the aforementioned strikes 
the improvement in the company s margins in the fourth quarter over the third quarter resulted from the return of delco electronics to more normal business levels after the aforementioned strikes and the strengthening of the market for the company s products in the fourth quarter 
operating results of the company s engineered materials and plumbing hardware business improved considerably during the fiscal year and accounted for approximately of the company s total operating profit 
results of operations sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  sales of the electronic materials business for the fiscal year were million  or of total sales worldwide  compared with million  or of total sales worldwide  for the fiscal year 
this increase in sales of electronic materials was principally the result of higher volume of electronic materials shipped and an increase in sales of higher technology products 
sales of the engineered materials and plumbing hardware business for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year due primarily to increased sales in the specialty adhesive tape and advanced composite materials businesses resulting from new products and higher volumes in both businesses 
the company s foreign operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year compared with million of sales  or of total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year increased from the fiscal year 
while sales by each of the company s foreign operations were higher in the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year  the increase in sales by foreign operations was principally due to an increase in sales by the company s asian operations 
a further expansion of the company s singapore manufacturing facility is planned during the company s fiscal year 
the gross margin for the company s worldwide operations was during the fiscal year compared with for the fiscal year 
the decline in the gross margin was attributable to inefficiencies resulting from dramatic volume fluctuations during the year  the impact of disruptions to the company s business with its largest customer  delco electronics corporation  due to strikes against general motors  selling price pressure and operating certain facilities at levels lower than their designed capacity  which were partially offset by the continuing growth in sales of higher technology  higher margin products 
selling  general and administrative expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
this reduction was a function of the partially fixed nature of the selling  general and administrative expenses relative to the increase in sales and lower incentive payments due to lower operating profits 
for the reasons set forth above  profit from operations for the fiscal year decreased to million from million for the fiscal year 
interest and other income  principally investment income  increased to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year 
interest expense for the fiscal year was million compared with million during the fiscal year 
the increases in investment income and interest expense were attributable to the increase in cash available for investment and the additional interest expense resulting from the company s issuance of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due at the end of the fiscal year 
the company s investments were primarily short term taxable instruments and government securities 
the company s effective income tax rate for the fiscal year was compared with for the fiscal year 
this decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of favorable foreign tax rate differentials 
net earnings for the fiscal year were million compared to million for the fiscal year 
primary and fully diluted earnings per share decreased to and  respectively  for the fiscal year from and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
this decrease in net earnings and earnings per share was primarily attributable to the decrease in the profit from operations 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s electronic materials business was responsible for the improvement in the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  the north american and asian markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials were strong during the fiscal year  and the company s electronic materials operations located in these regions performed well as a result 
while the market in europe for sophisticated printed circuit materials was not as strong as in north america or asia  it improved over the prior fiscal year  and the company s european operations benefitted from this improvement 
during the fiscal year  the company s electronic materials business incurred raw material cost increases and additional costs associated with the company s major expansion projects in newburgh  new york and tempe  arizona 
in addition  the electronic materials business experienced temporary inefficiencies caused by operating certain facilities at levels in excess of their designed manufacturing capacity 
these cost increases and temporary operating inefficiencies adversely affected the company s gross margins 
however  the company was able to offset such effects by improving its overall operating efficiencies  in part  by consolidating functions  by continuing to reduce manufacturing waste and improve yields  and by improving the overall productivity of its workforce 
in addition  the company redesigned product in order to reduce material costs 
the company was also able to offset these cost increases and inefficiencies through its ongoing efforts to expand its higher technology  higher margin product lines 
operating results of the company s engineered materials and plumbing hardware business improved slightly but were not significant during the fiscal year 
results of operations sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended february  sales of the electronic materials business for the fiscal year were million  or of total sales worldwide  compared with million  or of total sales worldwide  for the fiscal year 
this increase in sales of electronic materials was principally the result of higher volume of electronic materials shipped and an increase in sales of higher technology products 
sales of the engineered materials and plumbing hardware business for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year due primarily to increased sales in the specialty adhesive tape and plumbing hardware businesses resulting from new products and higher volumes 
the company s foreign operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year compared with million of sales  or of total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year increased from the fiscal year 
while sales by each of the company s foreign operations were higher in the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year  the increase in sales by foreign operations was principally due to an increase in sales by the company s asian operations 
an expansion of the company s singapore manufacturing facility was completed at the end of the company s fiscal year 
the gross margin for the company s worldwide operations was during the fiscal year compared with for the fiscal year 
the improvement in the gross margin was attributable to the increase in sales volume over the prior fiscal year  the continuing growth in sales of higher technology  higher margin products and improved operating efficien cies 
this improvement was offset in part by higher raw material costs  costs associated with the start up of the new facilities in new york and arizona  and inefficiencies caused by operating certain facilities at levels in excess of designed capacity 
selling  general and administrative expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
this reduction was a function of the partially fixed nature of the selling  general and administrative expenses relative to the increase in sales 
for the reasons set forth above  profit from operations for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year 
interest and other income  principally investment income  increased to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year 
the increase in investment income was attributable to the increase in the prevailing interest rates during the current year and to the increase in cash available for investment 
the company s investments were primarily short term taxable instruments and government securities 
interest expense for the fiscal year was minimal compared with million during the fiscal year 
during the first quarter of the prior fiscal year  the company called its convertible subordinated debentures for redemption  as a result  nearly all of such debentures outstanding at the beginning of the prior fiscal year were converted into common stock during that fiscal year s first quarter  which eliminated the company s long term debt and the associated interest expense 
the company s effective income tax rate for the fiscal year was compared with for the fiscal year 
this decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of favorable foreign tax rate differentials 
net earnings for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year 
primary and fully diluted earnings per share increased to and  respectively  for the fiscal year from and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
this increase in net earnings and earnings per share was primarily attributable to the increase in the profit from operations  the effects of the conversion of the debentures and the lower effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company s cash and temporary investments were million compared with million at march   the end of the company s fiscal year 
the increase in the company s cash and investment position at march  was attributable to cash provided from operating activities in excess of investments in property  plant and equipment  as discussed below 
the company s working capital was million at march  compared with million at march  the increase at march  compared with march  was due to the increases in cash and receivables  offset in part by lower inventories 
the increase in receivables at march  compared with march  was due principally to increased sales  the decrease in inventories for the same period was due to the utilization of raw materials accumulated in the fiscal year to ensure adequate supply of such materials 
the company s current ratio the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at march  compared with to at march  during the fiscal year  the company generated funds from operations of million and expended million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
cash provided by net earnings before depreciation and amortization of million was reduced by a net increase in non cash working capital items  resulting in million of cash provided from operating activities 
a significant portion of the fiscal year s capital expenditures related to installation of additional capacity at the company s electronic materials facilities in tempe  arizona and singapore 
these expansions will increase the company s capacity and capability for the production of sophisticated printed circuit materials 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million  million and million in the  and fiscal years  respec tively 
the company expects the level of capital expenditures in the fiscal year to be in excess of the expenditures in the fiscal year 
the company is planning further expansions of its electronic materials operations  particularly in the united states and asia 
at march   the company s only long term debt was the convertible subordinated notes due the notes issued at the end of the fiscal year 
the company believes its financial resources will be sufficient  for the foreseeable future  to provide for continued investment in property  plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes 
such resources  including the proceeds from the notes  would also be available for appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the company s business 
environmental matters the company is subject to various federal  state and local government requirements relating to the protection of the environment 
the company believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling  manufacture  use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations 
however  mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies  which were generally in compliance with applicable laws at the time of the operations in question  the company  like other companies engaged in similar businesses  is a party to claims by government agencies and third parties and has incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with environmental matters 
additional claims and costs involving past environmental matters may continue to arise in the future 
it is the company s policy to record appropriate liabilities for such matters when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in the  and fiscal years  the company charged approximately million  million and million  respectively  against pretax income for remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs including legal fees 
while annual expenditures have generally been constant from year to year  and may increase over time  the company expects it will be able to fund such expenditures from cash flow from operations 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors  including regulatory approval of cleanup projects  remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 
at march   the recorded liability in accrued liabilities for environmental matters was million 
management does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  capital resources  business or consolidated financial position of the company 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of the company s commitments and contingencies  including those related to environmental matters 
factors that may affect future results 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a new safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their companies without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement 
accordingly  the company hereby identifies the following important factors which could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from any such results which might be projected  forecast  estimated or budgeted by the company in forward looking state ments 

the company s business is dependent on certain aspects of the electronics industry  which is a cyclical industry and which has experienced recurring downturns 
the downturns  such as occurred in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year ended march   can be unexpected and have often reduced demand for  and prices of  electronic materials 

the company s operating results are affected by a number of factors  including various factors beyond the company s control 
such factors include economic conditions in the electronics industry  the timing of customer orders  product prices  process yields  the mix of products sold and maintenance related shutdowns of facilities 
operating results also can be influenced by development and introduction of new products and the costs associated with the start up of new facilities 

rapid technological advances in semiconductors and electronic equipment have placed rigorous demands on the electronic materials manufactured by the company and used in printed circuit board production 
the company s operating results will be affected by the company s ability to maintain and increase its technological and manufacturing capability and expertise in this rapidly changing industry 

the electronic materials industry is intensely competitive and the company competes worldwide in the market for materials used in the production of complex multilayer printed circuit boards 
the company s competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the company  and the company s operating results will be affected by its ability to maintain its competitive position in the industry 

there are a limited number of qualified suppliers of the principal materials used by the company in its manufacture of electronic materials products 
substitutes for these products are not readily available  and in the recent past there have been shortages in the market for certain of these materials 

the company s customer base is concentrated  in part  because the company s business strategy has been to develop long term relation ships with a select group of customers 
during the company s fiscal year ended march   the company s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales 
the company expects that sales to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of its net sales for the foreseeable future 
a loss of one or more of such key customers could affect the company s profitability 

the company typically does not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments 
instead  it relies primarily on continual communication with its customers to anticipate the future volume of purchase orders 
a variety of conditions  both specific to the individual customer and generally affecting the customer s industry  can cause a customer to reduce or delay orders previously anticipated by the company 

the company  from time to time  is engaged in the expansion of certain of its manufacturing facilities for electronic materials 
the anticipated costs of such expansions cannot be determined with precision and may vary materially from those budgeted 
in addition  such expansions will increase the company s fixed costs 
the company s future profitability depends upon its ability to utilize its manufacturing capacity in an effective manner 

the company s business is capital intensive and  in addition  the introduction of new technologies could substantially increase the company s capital expenditures 
in order to remain competitive the company must continue to make significant investments in capital equipment and expansion of operations 
this may require that the company continue to be able to access capital on terms acceptable to the company 

the company may acquire businesses  product lines or technologies that expand or complement those of the company 
the integration and management of an acquired company or business may strain the company s management resources and technical  financial and operating systems 
in addition  implementation of acquisitions can result in large one time charges and costs 
a given acquisition  if consummated  may materially affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

the company s international operations are subject to risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 

a portion of the sales and costs of the company s international operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

the company s success is dependent upon its relationship with key management and technical personnel 

the company s future success depends in part upon its intellectual property which the company seeks to protect through a combination of contract provisions  trade secret protections  copyrights and patents 

the company s production processes require the use  storage  treatment and disposal of certain materials which are considered hazardous under applicable environmental laws and the company is subject to a variety of regulatory requirements relating to the handling of such materials and the release of emissions and effluents into the environment 
other possible developments  such as the enactment or adoption of additional environmental laws  could result in substantial costs to the company 

the market price of the company s securities can be subject to fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in analysts earnings estimates  market conditions in the electronic materials industry  as well as general economic conditions and other factors external to the company 

the company s results could be affected by changes in the company s accounting policies and practices or changes in the company s organization  compensation and benefit plans  or changes in the company s material agreements or understandings with third parties
