item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general kaye group inc the company owns of the issued and outstanding stock of kaye holding corporation holding  collectively corporate  which is the primary asset of the company 
the company s business is conducted principally through the wholly owned subsidiaries of holding 
following the transactions  the company operates in two business segments insurance brokerage  which includes the retail brokerage business and the program brokerage business the insurance brokerage companies and property and casualty insurance or insurance which comprises the insurance companies and claims administration the property and casualty companies 
the revenues and expenses of the property and casualty insurance segment will not be comparable to the amounts reported previously by old lyme 
historically  the commission income of the program brokerage business was recorded as a reduction of acquisition costs in the consolidated statements of income of old lyme 
as a result of the transactions  management includes the commission income and the other revenues and operating costs of the program brokerage business in the insurance brokerage segment for all periods presented 
overview the insurance brokerage companies derive their revenue principally from commissions associated with the placement of insurance coverage for corporate clients 
these commissions are paid by the insurance carriers and are usually a fixed percentage of the total premiums 
there is normally a lag between receipt of funds from the insured and payment to the insurance company 
investment of these funds over this period generates additional revenue in the form of interest income 
historically  the commission income was recognized at the time coverage was bound and invoiced 
if coverage was invoiced in installments  the commission was recognized on each installment 
because revenue recognition should be tied to the performance of the service and not to the cash flow effects of billing arrangements  in  the insurance brokerage companies adopted a common industry practice of recognizing all commission on a policy at the time coverage is bound and invoiced  whether or not installment billing is used 
this change resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment of  which represents installment invoicing recognized in  which under the new policy would have been recorded in and prior years 
the amount recognized under the new policy in  relating to installment billings to be made in totaled approximately  the insurance business underwrites property and casualty risks for insureds in the united states and is sold principally through specially designed programs  covering various types of businesses and properties which have similar risk characteristics 
the insurance business generally underwrites the first layer of insurance under the programs and unaffiliated program insurers provide coverage for losses above the first layer of risk 
substantially all of the insurance business revenues are derived from premiums on this business  plus the investment income generated by the investment portfolio of the insurance business 
insurance coverage under the programs is provided through a variety of underwriting structures  including reinsurance arrangements where direct coverage may not be possible 
rli insurance company rli  an unaffiliated company  has had reinsurance agreements with the property and casualty companies since to provide direct coverage in certain of such circumstances 
rli writes various policies from the first layer of risk under the programs and cedes to the property and casualty companies a certain percentage of premiums to purchase a stop loss policy in the event rli s losses exceed a fixed percentage of net premiums written 
in the event losses are less than the fixed percentage  the insurance brokerage business will receive a contingent commission equal to such amount net of fees paid to rli 
only the premiums ceded to the property and casualty companies for the stop loss policy are included in the net premiums written and earned for the insurance business 
corporate operations include those expenses not directly related to the insurance brokerage companies or insurance businesses 
these expenses are associated with being a public company and interest expense on corporate debt 
the company has foreign operations in bermuda 
for further discussion see note to the consolidated financial statements 
a comprehensive analysis of the results of operations of the company would not be meaningful without consideration of the charge in lieu of taxes 
the provision for income taxes  as reported in the historical financial statements  does not provide for any income taxes on certain subsidiaries of the company prior to the combination on october  prior to the transactions on october   the brokerage partnerships and brokerage corporations were either limited partnerships or s corporations under the internal revenue code  and therefore  the individual partners or shareholders  rather than the companies were liable for income taxes 
accordingly  the company has presented a calculation of pro forma income for each of the three years in the period ended december  which reflects a charge in lieu of income taxes  as if all subsidiaries were included in the company s consolidated federal income tax return for all years presented 
management believes this presentation will better present current and future comparisons of the effective tax rate and federal and state income tax expense of the company
