this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
general the company was formed in december on march   the company acquired certain technology and assets from kodak relating to the volt lithium manganese dioxide battery 
the company is currently producing  and volt lithium batteries in commercial quantities at its newark  new york facility 
the company also produces and markets high rate lithium batteries and seawater batteries at its uk subsidiary in abingdon  england 
since its inception  the company has concentrated significant resources toward research and development activities primarily related to its solid state lithium ion rechargeable battery in recent years 
the company has shipped prototypes of its rechargeable batteries for testing to original equipment manufacturers and others 
in addition to the company s preliminary manual production line  the company has developed and implemented a semi automatic flexible production line for initial production runs and medium volume programs 
high volume rechargeable battery manufacturing equipment is currently being tested and installed in newark  ny 
the company believes that its results of operations in prior periods may not be indicative of results in future periods 
future operating results may be affected by a wide range of factors and may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the company reports the results of two business segments  battery sales and technology contracts 
technology contracts include technological and research and development services to government agencies and other third parties 
in fiscal  and  revenue from technology contracts represented approximately  and  respectively  of the total revenues 
the company expects revenues from technology contracts as a percentage of total revenues to continue to decrease as battery sales increase 
certain of its technology contracts  including those with the us government absorb certain of the company s research and development costs 
the company  while segmenting revenues for technology contracts  does not allocate its general research and development costs to specific technology contracts 
accordingly  operating income related to the technology contracts does not reflect the allocation of these expenses 
the company believes that the relatively moderate rate of inflation in recent years has not had a significant impact on the company s revenues or profitability 
net sales by business segment battery sales    technology contracts    total revenue    income loss by business segment batteries    technology contracts    all other    net loss    results of operations fiscal years ended june  and total revenues increased by  or during the year ended june  fiscal to  from  for the year ended june  fiscal 
this was principally due to an increase of battery sales in the amount of  or to  during fiscal from  for fiscal this increase in battery revenues was generated by both the us and the us operations 
in the us  revenues from the company s ba battery increased as contract extensions were received from the us army which supported increasing production rates throughout the year 
this was partially offset by reduced levels of volt battery sales to the smoke detector market 
in the uk  additional sales to the ministry of defense were partially offset by decreased revenues from the high rate lithium and seawater batteries 
these reduced revenues in the uk were primarily caused by limitations of the manufacturing facility due to a fire in december revenues generated from technology contracts decreased from  in to  in this is the result of completion of certain contracts and delays in receipt of new programs as the company concentrates its efforts on implementation of the rechargeable battery manufacturing line 
the cost of products sold increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal as a ratio to revenues  the cost of products sold was for fiscal and for fiscal cost of products sold related to battery sales increased to  or of revenues for fiscal compared to  or of revenues for fiscal net cost of products sold in the us increased slightly 
higher operating efficiencies were realized in manufacturing the ba battery 
however  during fiscal  the company reduced manufacturing levels of the volt batteries to align inventory with sales volume which resulted in increased unabsorbed overhead expenses 
the lower production volume during fiscal reduced net inventory by more than  or compared to during fiscal  the company received funds from the insurance carriers which were reimbursement for excess costs generated as a result of the fire in december  the funds received were applied primarily to the cost of products sold in the uk technology contracts cost of products sold experienced a decrease of  or during compared to operating expenses increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal selling  general and administration expenses increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the company anticipates that selling expenses will continue to increase in order to support new products planned to be introduced during fiscal and afterwards 
research and development expenses increased by  or to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this increase is due primarily to increasing expenditures incurred to support the rechargeable battery program 
also included in total operating expenses was  of payments received in excess of the loss provision related to the fires which occurred in the uk during  the company provided a reserve of  for losses related to fires 
generally  the company records expenses related to the fires as they are incurred and records the offsetting insurance proceeds only when received 
additionally  the company wrote off its investment in the china development project and related receivables due under provisions of various agreements during the third quarter of fiscal the total cost of these write offs was  the original purpose of the company s participation in the china development program was to make available the a size lithium battery at a competitive cost 
other sources for this battery have since been identified and are supplying the company s requirements 
interest income declined by  or to  for fiscal from  for fiscal  due to a lower average balance invested as the company has used cash and investments to fund the capital equipment improvements and operations during net loss per common share increased to in fiscal  based on  weighted average number of shares outstanding  from a loss of per share for fiscal with  weighted average number of shares outstanding 
net revenue increased in compared to however  an unfavorable mix with less revenue generated from technology contracts decreased the gross profit by  selling  general and administrative expenses combined with research and development increased by in order to continue support for the company s new solid polymer lithium ion rechargeable battery 
also  during fiscal  the company recorded a gain from the sale of securities in the amount of fiscal year ended june  and total revenues increased by  or to  during the year ended june  fiscal from  for fiscal sales of batteries increased to  during fiscal from  during fiscal  an increase of or  revenues from technology contracts decreased by  or to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the increased battery revenues were generated by the us operations where sales of primary batteries rose reflecting a substantial increase in the number of batteries sold to both existing and new customers 
in the uk operations  battery sales declined primarily as a result of a fire that occurred during the year 
technology contract revenues declined as the company s contract relating to the establishment of a battery manufacturing facility in the peoples republic of china was in its final stage 
the cost of products sold increased to  for fiscal from  an increase of  or 
as a ratio to revenues  the cost of products sold was for fiscal and for fiscal cost of products sold related to battery sales increased to  or of revenues for fiscal compared to  or for fiscal manufacturing operations in the us improved slightly in fiscal compared to the prior year 
this net improvement occurred despite a production slowdown in the fourth fiscal quarter caused by reduced levels of battery sales 
in the uk  the cost of batteries sold increased substantially during fiscal when compared to primarily due to a fire during the year 
technology contract cost of products sold decreased to  or of revenues during fiscal from  or of revenues for the same period of the prior year 
the increased gross margin during fiscal reflects payments received for development funding and extension of the period of exclusivity until the end of calendar from one of the world s leading cellular telephone manufacturers 
these payments had no associated cost of products sold 
total operating expenses increased to  for fiscal from  for the same period of the prior year  an increase of  or 
of this total  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or due to additional costs to promote battery sales 
research and development increased to  during fiscal from  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increased cost is associated with continuing support of the company s rechargeable battery program 
the company has expended funds to continue development of the lithium ion solid state rechargeable battery in anticipation of market introduction during fiscal net interest income increased to  during fiscal from  for fiscal due to increasing interest rates during the twelve month period 
the company realized a gain on the sale of  shares of intermagnetics general corporation img common stock it sold during the year 
as of september   the company owns  shares of common stock of img 
this includes a stock dividend declared to img shareholders of record as of august  during fiscal  the company provided a reserve against possible uninsured expenses related to the fire that occurred at the uk operations during fiscal net loss per common share decreased during fiscal to based on  weighted average number of shares outstanding from per share based on  weighted average number of shares outstanding during fiscal the modest increase in revenues   was offset by additional cost of products sold so that gross profit for fiscal was unchanged from additional operating expenses  primarily research and development to support the company s developmental lithium ion solid state rechargeable battery resulted in an increased loss from operations during fiscal when compared to this increased loss from operations was more than offset by the realized gain from the sale of securities and additional interest income 
as a result  net loss for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company used  of cash in operating activities as compared to  in fiscal the substantial decrease in the cash used in operations was primarily the result of decreases in inventories  accounts receivable and earned contracts receivable offset by increased net loss for fiscal and decreased accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
in fiscal  the company used  to purchase equipment  primarily for the company s rechargeable battery production line 
a continuation of substantial capital expenditures as well as research and development expenses is anticipated as the company moves toward mass production and continued improvement of rechargeable batteries 
as of june   the company has in excess of million of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
the company s current financial position is adequate to maintain its operations through fiscal
