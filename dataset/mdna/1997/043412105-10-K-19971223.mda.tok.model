item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the distribution of products such as those offered by the company has been characterized by rapid change  including consolidations and financial difficulties of distributors and the emergence of alternative distribution channels 
in addition  there are an increasing number of product suppliers competing for access to these channels 
distributors may  at their option and at any time  cease marketing the company s products without prior notice to the company 
a reduction in the sales effort by any of the company s major distributors or the loss of any one of these distributors would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that future sales by the company s distributors will remain at current levels or that the company will be able to retain its current distributors on terms that are commercially reasonable to the company 
although the company believes that its major distributors are currently adequately capitalized  there can be no assurance that in the future one or more of these distributors will not experience financial difficulties 
such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in fiscal  the company changed its limited warranty policy to cover all products for the life of the product 
in fiscal  the company altered a portion of its warranty policy limiting coverage on certain of its high end switch products to years 
the company has not encountered material warranty claims  although there can be no assurance that claims will not increase substantially over time as a result of the change to a lifetime warranty for a majority of the company s products 
future warranty claims exceeding the company s reserves for warranty expense could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
company warranties are limited to the company s obligation to repair or replace the defective product 
the company attempts to further limit its liability to end users through disclaimers of special  consequential and indirect damages and similar provisions in its end user warranty 
however  no assurance can be given that such limitations of liability will be legally enforceable 
backlog the company generally ships products shortly after orders are received and consequently maintains very little backlog 
accordingly  the company does not believe that its backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future sales 
engineering and product development the markets for the company s client access and network system products continue to be characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
asante believes that maintaining its market position in the macintosh tm connectivity market and expanding its presence in the multiplatform market requires continuing investment to develop new products  enhance existing products and reduce manufacturing costs 
as of september   the company had employees engaged in engineering and product development 
during the fiscal years ended september   september   and september   the company s engineering and product development expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the company continues to invest significant resources in engineering projects and will continue to focus additional resources as needed in order to bring to market additional high technology  high demand products supporting both its network systems and the intranet internet markets 
in particular  in fiscal and going forward  the company will focus additional efforts in the areas of software design  asic application specific integrated circuit design  and on system integration 
the company s believes its future success will depend upon its ability to enhance and expand its existing product offerings and to develop in a timely manner new products that achieve rapid market acceptance 
substantially all of the company s products are designed to provide connectivity to ethernet lans 
if the company is unable for technological or other reasons to modify its products or develop new products to support fast ethernet or switched ethernet technology  or if ethernet s importance declines as a result of alternative technologies  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing enhanced or new products in a timely manner  that those products will gain market acceptance  or that the company will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new industry standards 
manufacturing and suppliers the company s manufacturing operations consist primarily of managing its materials and inventories  purchasing certain components  performing limited final assembly of some products and testing and performing quality control of certain materials  components  subassemblies and systems 
the company subcontracts substantially all of the assembly of its products 
this includes orient semiconductor electronics  ltd 
ose  a semiconductor and printed circuit board assembler based in taiwan  and several other subcontractors and manufacturers based in california  taiwan and china 
the company believes that its quality control procedures and the quality standards of its manufacturing partners have been instrumental in the high performance and reliability of the company s products 
to date  customer returns of the company s products due to poor workmanship have not been material 
see note of notes to financial statements 
ose and the company s other subcontract manufacturers purchase or manufacture most components  assemble printed circuit boards  and test and package products for asante on a purchase order  turnkey basis 
in fiscal  the company purchased million of goods from ose 
the company does not have a long term supply agreement with any of its subcontractors 
if any one of these subcontractors experience financial or operational difficulties that result in a reduction or interruption in the supply of products to the company  or otherwise fail to deliver products to the company on a timely basis  the company would be required to procure sufficient manufacturing supply through alternative sources 
the company believes that alternative manufacturers are available  however  the qualification of such alternative sources and the commencement of volume manufacturing of the company s products could take a significant period of time 
accordingly  any reduction or interruption of supply from its existing subcontractors would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the use of ose and other offshore subcontractors subjects the company to certain risks of conducting business internationally  including changes in trade policy and regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  and changes in the political or economic environment in taiwan 
although the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products  certain key components used in the company s products are available from only one source and others are available from only a limited number of sources 
components currently available from only one source include  among others  custom integrated circuits used in the company s intelligent hubs  and certain asics used in the company s and t switching products 
the company does not have a long term supply agreement with any of its suppliers 
the company believes that certain key components remain in short supply  and from time to time receives only limited allocations of these products which in prior years has caused shipping delays of one or more of the company s products 
if the company or any of its suppliers experience component shortages in the future or any of its competitors have long term supply agreements under which it is possible for them to obtain greater supplies of such components than the company  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the company also relies on ose and subcontractors to procure many of the components used in the company s products 
procurement and stocking of components and subassemblies is done by these subcontractors based on the company s purchase orders 
competition the markets for the company s products are highly competitive  and the company believes that such competition will intensify 
competitive factors in the company s markets are continuing declines in average selling prices  coupled with improvements in product features and performance 
the company expects such trends will continue 
in the mainstream market  the company competes with cisco systems  bay networks  com  and many smaller companies 
competition from these and other companies  including new entrants  is expected to intensify  particularly in the departmental users market 
many of the company s competitors in this market are more established  enjoy significant name recognition and possess far greater financial  technological and marketing resources than the company 
the company believes the principal competitive factors in the departmental connectivity market are brand name recognition  value for price  breadth of product line  technical features  ease of product use  reliability  customer support and the ability to develop and introduce new or enhanced products rapidly 
the company believes that it has established itself as a supplier of high quality  reliable products and as a result  currently competes favorably with respect to these factors 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future against current or future competitors  or that it will be able to adapt successfully to changes in the market for its products 
the company s inability to compete successfully in any respect or to timely respond to market demands or changes would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the macintosh tm client access market  apple develops and markets products that compete directly with certain of the company s client access products 
the company also competes with a number of other companies in this market 
apple provides ethernet connectivity in its computers which has adversely affected sales of the company s client access products 
the company also relies on an informal working relationship with apple in connection with the company s product development efforts 
apple is likely to continue to introduce competitive products  and has significantly greater financial  marketing and technical resources than the company 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that apple will not pursue a more aggressive strategy with respect to competitive products  increase the availability of ethernet on the motherboard of its computers or in other ways attempt to make the sale of add on products by third party developers and vendors such as the company more difficult 
if apple takes any of such actions  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal  a larger portion of the company s sales represented products sold to oems 
while the company has pursued  and will continue to pursue  additional oem agreements with larger companies  there can be no assurance that existing oem agreements will continue or that new agreements will be obtained 
in addition  since the company intends to seek additional large product volume arrangements  the loss of a single large oem customer or several smaller oem customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues 
unless the company signs additional large oem agreements in the near future  the company expects that oem sales will represent a lower percentage of total revenue in fiscal a significant percentage of the company s sales in fiscal were derived from products designed for use with macintosh tm computers 
sales of these products as a percentage of total company revenue  excluding oem sales  have steadily declined over the last several years due to apple s competition in the company s adapter card market and apple s decline in market share 
however  the company expects that sales of such products will continue to represent a substantial portion of its net sales for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that unit sales of these products will continue at their present levels or increase in the future 
any material adverse developments in apple s business could have a material adverse effect on sales of the company s client access products  which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
proprietary rights the company has received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties asserting intellectual property claims against the company 
claims made in the future could include assertions that the company s products infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of third parties or requests for indemnification against such infringement 
there can be no assurance that any claim will not result in litigation  which could involve significant expense to the company 
if the company is required or deems it appropriate to obtain a license relating to one or more products or future technologies  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the company relies on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark law  nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s technology is difficult  and there can be no assurance that the measures being taken by the company will be successful 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights in its products to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
see item legal proceedings 
employees as of september   the company had employees  including in engineering and product development  in manufacturing operations  in marketing  sales and support services  and in corporate administration 
the company s success also depends to a significant extent upon the contributions of key sales  marketing  engineering  manufacturing  and administrative employees  and on the company s ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel  who are in great demand 
none of the company s key employees are subject to a non competition agreement with the company 
unless vacancies are promptly filled  the loss of current key employees or the company s inability to attract and retain other qualified employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor organization  and the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement 
the company has never had any employee strike or work stoppage and considers its relations with its employees to be good 
item properties the company s headquarters  including its executive offices and corporate administration  manufacturing  marketing  sales and technical support facilities  are located in san jose  california 
the company occupies this facility under a lease with an original expiration date of september  and providing for two options to extend the lease for up to an additional two and five years  respectively 
during fiscal  the company exercised its option to extend the lease for an additional two years 
the current two year lease extension option expires on august  during  the company leased sales offices in southern california  colorado  north carolina  utah  washington  taiwan  england and japan 
the company believes that its existing facilities are adequate to meet its requirements for the foreseeable future and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed 
see note of notes to financial statements 
item legal proceedings from time to time the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business  including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
in july and august of  several complaints were filed against the company and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the united states district court  northern district of california  alleging violations of federal securities laws 
the lawsuits  which purport to be class actions brought on behalf of all purchasers of the company s stock during the period from december  through july   were consolidated and plaintiffs filed a consolidated  amended class action complaint on october  in september  the company entered into an agreement in principle to settle the suit with the establishment of a settlement fund of million 
the company contributed  with the remainder funded by the company s insurance 
on november   the court entered an order finally approving the settlement and dismissing the action against all defendants with prejudice 
see note of notes to financial statements 
on september   a complaint was filed by datapoint corporation against the company and six other companies individually and as purported representatives of a defendant class of all manufacturers  vendors and users of fast ethernet compliant  dual protocol local area network products  for alleged infringement of united states letters patent nos 
 and  the complaint seeks unspecified damages in excess of  and permanent injunctive relief 
the company has filed a response to the complaint denying any purported claims of the suit and the case is currently in its discovery phase 
the company intends to defend the action vigorously

part ii item market for the registrant s common stock and related stockholder matters the following table sets forth the high and low sale prices for the company s common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market under the trading symbol asnt for the company s last two fiscal years 
fiscal high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter as of november   there were stockholders of record of the company s common stock 
the company has not paid cash dividends on its common stock and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company  its competitors and other third parties as well as quarterly variations in the company s anticipated or actual results of operations and market conditions in high technology industries generally  may cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate significantly 
the stock market has on occasion experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many high technology companies and have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in addition  the actual results and related market price of the company s stock may not be indicative of current or future performance 
subsequent to the company s fiscal year end  the company issued  shares of its restricted common stock to dr

results of operations the following table sets forth certain selected financial information expressed as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years ended september   and september   and september   respectively net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss the company recorded net income for fiscal of million  or per share compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal net sales net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales were million in the increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to increased shipments of the company s fast ethernet adapter products and new switched products as well as a significant increase in oem sales 
this increase was partially offset by reduced shipments of the company s t mbps adapter cards due in part to apple s incorporation of ethernet connectivity into the motherboard of certain of its macintosh tm and powerbook computers and competitive pricing pressures 
sales of the company s dual speed fast cards and pci products increased by million to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal this is due primarily to increased incorporation of the mbps  or fast ethernet industry standard  into an increasing number of client networks as prices decrease and the demand for higher bandwidth increases 
sales of these mbps adapter cards are expected to increase in fiscal as the company introduces additional mbps switching products into its product line 
the company also saw significant growth in the sales of its switch products  due primarily to the introduction of the several new switch products during the second half of fiscal sales of switch products increased by approximately million to million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal in addition  sales of product to oem customers increased to approximately of sales in fiscal compared with insignificant oem sales in fiscal in particular  sales of the company s mbps fast hubs to oem customers increased materially during the year  complementing sales the company made of an oem ethernet fax modem card sold by the company to apple computer in fiscal  an agreement which concludes in early fiscal oem sales are expected to constitute a significantly smaller portion of the company s total sales in fiscal during fiscal  the company expanded its line of fast ethernet base t  or mbps products and introduced new software technology to complement the fast ethernet product line 
the company continued to focus its efforts on certain vertical market segments where fast ethernet switches and hub systems excel over standard ethernet 
pricing continued to be under heavy competitive pressure  and in response  the company continued a number of programs including discount programs  value added reseller programs  selling incentives  educational specific discounts  and announced several product price reductions during the year 
the increase in sales from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to new product introductions of the company s and mbps adapter card and network system products including the completion of a full line of mbps stackable and non stackable hubs and to the introduction of the company s first mbps switches 
international sales  primarily to customers in europe  canada and asia pacific  accounted for   and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company established a sales office in germany  complementing its other international sales offices in the united kingdom  japan  taiwan  and canada 
despite this increased presence internationally  the company experienced reductions in sales from its international offices  mostly in japan and asia due in part to the weakening of foreign currencies against the dollar worldwide and in part to the softness in demand for apple macintosh tm related products in asia 
the company will continue to focus its efforts on increasing sales internationally over the next several quarters  but cannot be sure that its efforts will be successful 
the company believes that the competition in the markets in which it competes has intensified and will continue to intensify as existing and potential competitors introduce competing products 
as such  the company anticipates that the selling prices of its products will continue to decline 
the company makes significant ongoing efforts to develop new products and decrease its manufacturing costs faster than related declines in selling prices 
if the company is unable to offset anticipated price declines in its products by reducing its manufacturing costs and by introducing new products that gain market acceptance  its business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
gross profit the company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in  and in fiscal this decrease during fiscal was due primarily to increased sales of product to oem customers at lower margins and was also partially affected during the year by charges against sales due to various pricing and marketing programs 
this gross profit decrease was partially offset by the company s ability to achieve higher sales of certain of its advanced systems products with better margins 
the company s gross profit percentage in the future will continue to be affected by competitive pricing pressures  the company s ability to further reduce the cost of its products  and the company s pursuit of certain oem sales opportunities at lower margins 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales from in fiscal to in fiscal was attributable primarily to improved management of production cycles and distribution channel inventory balances 
the company s gross profit percentage increase was partially offset during the year by charges against sales due to various pricing and marketing programs 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased by to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the fiscal expenses increased by from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expenses were   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company increased its direct field staff organization in order to focus its sales strategy on penetrating the ibm compatible market and its chosen vertical markets in order to capture market share 
in achieving these goals the company was able to lower the number of independent sales firms representing the company  which served to significantly reduce spending on outside commissions in fiscal in addition  by focusing more on vertical markets and targeted markets  the company has been able to reduce its spending on tradeshow  advertising  and collateral related expenses 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses from fiscal to fiscal was primarily a result of the addition of direct field sales personnel during fiscal and fiscal  and to additional vertical marketing and pc related sales and marketing programs  offset partially by lower outside representative commissions in the second half of fiscal the company expects that its sales and marketing expenses will increase slightly in fiscal in absolute dollars 
research and development research and development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal research and development expenses were million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the million increase in expenses from to resulted from the company s commitment to focus additional resources on research and development in order to bring more fast ethernet base t  or mbps products  switching products  and software products to market 
as a result  salaries and wages increased by million  and expenses related to prototype materials  tooling and set up charges increased by approximately million as the company introduced two new lines of switching products 
research and development expenses increased by million from fiscal to fiscal due primarily to the company s focus on bringing additional key switching  fast ethernet  and software products to market 
as a result  the company increased expenses relating to salaries and wages to recruit additional engineering personnel  non recurring engineering expense charges  as well as other research related expenses 
the company expects that spending on research and development will increase in the future in order to support the development of new products incorporating the fast ethernet standard  switching technology  asic technology  and cost reduction efforts pertaining to current products 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were   and in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses during fiscal was primarily due to increased outside service and consulting related fees and to increased salary and wage related expenses 
the decrease in administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal was related primarily to the settlement and reduction in related defense litigation costs associated with the stockholders class action suit and lower salary and other wage related expenses due to the company s effort to control expenses 
the company expects that general and administrative expenses will increase slightly in fiscal in absolute dollars 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate for fiscal   and  was   and  respectively of revenue 
such rates differ from federal statutory rates principally due to state taxes and  in  research and development credits 
factors affecting future operating results the company operates in a rapidly changing and growing industry  which is characterized by vigorous competition from both established companies and start up companies 
the market for the company s products is extremely competitive both as to price and capabilities 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to enhance existing products and introduce new high technology products 
the company must also bring its products to market at competitive price levels 
unexpected changes in technological standards  customer demand and pricing of competitive products could adversely affect the company s operating results if the company is unable to effectively and timely respond to such changes 
the industry is also dependent to a large extent on proprietary intellectual property rights 
from time to time the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business  including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
consequently from time to time the company will be required to prosecute or defend against alleged infringements of such rights 
the company s success also depends to a significant extent upon the contributions of key sales  marketing  engineering  manufacturing  and administrative employees  and on the company s ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel  who are in great demand 
none of the company s key employees are subject to a non competition agreement with the company 
unless vacancies are promptly filled  the loss of current key employees or the company s inability to attract and retain other qualified employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
successfully addressing these factors is subject to various risks discussed in this report and other factors 
the company is subject to various risks associated with international operations including currency exchange rate fluctuations  changes in costs of labor and material  reliability of sources of supply and general economic conditions in foreign countries 
unexpected changes in foreign manufacturing or sources of supply  fluctuations in monetary exchange rates and changes in the availability  capability or pricing of foreign suppliers could affect the results of the company s operations 
in  a coalition of more than one hundred companies including asante supplying adapters  hubs  and other networking equipment developed a new standard for increasing the data transmission speed over ethernet networks by ten fold 
this standard base t  or fast ethernet has been adopted widely by end user customers because of its ability to increase the efficiency of lans and because of its ease of integration into existing base t networks 
because of the importance of this standard  the company recently focused its research and development activities on introducing future products incorporating base t technology 
the company realizes the importance of bringing more base t mbps switching and base t switching to market in order to complement its existing base t shared products 
in that regard  the company s future operating results may be dependent on the market acceptance and the rate of adoption of this new technology 
the company commits to expense levels  including investing in advertising and promotional programs  based in part on expectations as to future net sales levels 
if future net sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet the company s expectations or the company does not bring new products timely to market  the company may not be able to reduce or reallocate such expense levels on a timely basis  which could adversely affect the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
the company s target markets include end users  value added resellers vars  systems integrators and oems 
due to the relative size of the customers in some of these markets  particularly the oem market  sales in any one market could fluctuate dramatically on a quarter to quarter basis in summary  the company s net sales and operating results in any particular quarter may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including competition in the markets for the company s products  delays in new product introductions by the company  market acceptance of new products incorporating base t by the company or its competitors  changes in product pricing  material costs or customer discounts  the size and timing of customer orders  distributor and end user purchasing cycles  variations in the mix of product sales  manufacturing delays or disruptions in sources of supply  and economic conditions and seasonal purchasing patterns specific to the computer and networking industries 
the company s future operating results will depend  to a large extent  on its ability to anticipate and successfully react to these and other factors the factors discussed above  as well as other factors which generally affect the market for stocks of high technology companies  will affect the price of the company s stock and could cause such stock prices to fluctuate over relatively short periods of time 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company s operating activities provided cash of million compared to net cash provided of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  the increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income of million  decreases in accounts receivable and the company s income tax receivable and was offset by an increase in inventory  and by the decrease in the company s accounts payable balances 
the increase in cash during resulted from the increase in accounts payable and decrease in income tax receivable resulting from a loss carryback and was partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable  inventory  and the reduction in accounts payable to a major stockholder 
days of sales outstanding decreased to at the end of fiscal compared to at the end of fiscal which had the effect of increasing cash from operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal which was due primarily to purchases of property and equipment  predominately for engineering  totaling approximately million 
the company s purchasing activities consisted primarily of investments in computers  related equipment  and direct research and development related equipment 
during fiscal   and  the company s purchases of property and equipment totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
during fiscal   and  the company generated cash from financing activities of approximately million 
the proceeds were predominately generated from the exercise of employee stock options 
at september   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million as compared to million at september  working capital was million at september   compared to million at september  the company has a bank line of credit that provides for maximum borrowings of million  limited to a certain percentage of eligible accounts receivable  and bears interest at the bank s base rate 
the company s ability to borrow under this line is subject to compliance with covenants related to financial performance and condition 
as of september  there were no borrowings under the line of credit  and the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
the line of credit expires on january  the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents  together with cash expected to be generated by operations and existing credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund its operations and meet capital requirements through fiscal however  if additional funds are required there can be no assurance that such funds will be available at all or on terms favorable to the company and its stockholders
