the company s actual results could differ materially from its historical operating results and from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  without limitation  those set forth below  under factors affecting future operating results and elsewhere in this report 
overview the company s products and services and the markets it serves have evolved and expanded in concert with the rapid advancements in technology and the elevated focus on human resource management 
from its inception in through the first half of fiscal  the company s product revenue consisted primarily of dos based applicant tracking and succession planning systems 
in june   the company introduced a new generation of windows based  client server staffing software  which incorporates high volume resume scanning  skills management and search capabilities 
in november   the company broadened its offerings with the introduction of restrac webhire  a service which provides candidate management functions via the internet and the world wide web 
at september   the company had approximately licensed customers using its client server  windows based software 
to date  revenue from outside of north america has not exceeded of total revenue for any fiscal year 
total revenue consists of product revenue and services revenue 
product revenue is primarily derived from perpetual end user licenses to use the company s products 
through september   the company s product revenue included revenue from the resale of third party scanning hardware 
in october  the company effectively stopped serving as a reseller of hardware 
scanning hardware resale revenue represented  and of total product revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
product revenue from software license fees is recognized upon delivery  provided there are no significant company obligations remaining and collectibility of the revenue is probable 
services revenue from customer maintenance fees for postcontract support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term  which is typically months 
when customer maintenance fees are included in an initial software license fee  the company allocates approximately of the software license fee to the first year s maintenance 
the amount allocated to customer maintenance fees for the first year is comparable to customer maintenance fees charged separately by the company 
other services revenue from training  installation  consulting and scanning is recognized as the related services are performed 
during fiscal the company increased the size of its operating facilities by over and entered into new leases for its corporate headquarters  its chicago office and its west coast office 
the direct increase in facilities costs associated with these leases will approximate million per year as compared to fiscal the increase for fiscal was approximately million 
facilities costs are allocated among income statement expense categories based principally on functional headcount 
results of operations in thousands the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenue represented by each item reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations

product revenue was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal and an increase of from fiscal to fiscal over of the reduction in product revenue in fiscal is attributable to smaller sales transactions as compared to fiscal the remaining reduction is due to lower shipment volumes in fiscal because the company s product revenue consists of a relatively small number of large dollar transactions  the average sales price and number of units shipped can fluctuate widely from period to period 
such fluctuations are not necessarily indicative of future results 
hardware resales contributed to the first fiscal quarter 
the company no longer serves as a reseller of hardware 
further  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  more customers chose to license a large number of users with their initial system deployment  resulting in a significantly higher average sales price for fiscal some customers initially deploy the product on a selective  divisional or business unit basis and later license additional users 
this latter pattern accounts for of the growth in product revenue for fiscal over fiscal the remainder of the increase in product revenue for fiscal is attributable to a combination of price increases and larger sales transactions as compared to fiscal sales to existing customers represented approximately  and of total software licenses in fiscal years  and  respectively 
services revenue 
services revenue was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing an increase of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal increased maintenance revenue  generated by the continued growth in the restrac hire and resume reader for peoplesoft installed base  accounts for and of the total increase in services revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the remaining increases are attributable to the company s continued enhancements of its services offerings  with the addition of outsourced scanning services late in fiscal and the introduction of standardized training and education programs throughout fiscal there can be no assurances that the company will sustain these levels of services revenue growth 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue includes royalty payments for third party software embedded in the company s products  third party hardware costs only and costs of documentation and shipping 
cost of product revenue decreased to for fiscal from  for fiscal cost of product revenue increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal cost of product revenue decreased as a percentage of product revenue to for fiscal from for fiscal and for fiscal the percentage decrease for fiscal as compared to fiscal is due primarily to favorable rate revisions in the royalties due under third party licensing arrangements 
the percentage decrease for fiscal from fiscal is primarily attributable to the company s decision to discontinue reselling scanning hardware  which represented of cost of product revenue for fiscal cost of services revenue 
cost of services revenue includes all costs of maintaining the client services organization  including salaries and personnel related expenses  travel  outside consulting services  facilities cost and  to a lessor extent  third party scanning services and royalty payments for software maintenance 
cost of services revenue increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal cost of services revenue increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the increases in absolute dollars for each of the years are principally attributable to increased personnel and associated costs in the client services organization to support a larger client base and proportionately higher services revenue 
cost of services revenue decreased as a percentage of services revenue to for fiscal from for and for the higher mix of services revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is reflected in the slight decrease in gross margin to from 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses include all costs associated with the product engineering and quality functions  including salaries and personnel related expenses  travel  outside consulting services and facilities costs 
research and development expenses were  or of total revenue for fiscal as compared to  or of total revenue for fiscal and  or of total revenue for fiscal these significant increases in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for the years presented are primarily due to increases in both personnel and consulting expenses in support of the company s new and existing product development initiatives and its quality assurance programs 
the company had employees dedicated to research and development efforts at the end of fiscal as compared to employees at the end of fiscal and employees at the end of fiscal the company considers continued investment in research and development to be integral to its future success 
however  research and development spending is expected to decline as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal all of the company s research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include promotional costs and trade shows and costs associated with personnel involved in sales and marketing functions  including salaries  commissions and other personnel related expenses  travel  outside consulting services and facilities costs 
sales and marketing expenses were  or of total revenue for fiscal as compared to  or of total revenue for fiscal and  or of total revenue for fiscal the company continued to make significant investments in its sales organization in fiscal  adding personnel and expanding its west coast and central us facilities to accommodate the geographic distribution of sales and services personnel and to better support the customer base 
the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal from fiscal related to increased marketing program costs in support of the company s sales efforts and an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel 
the company expects that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars  however  such expenses may vary from year to year as a percentage of total revenue 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of costs for corporate operations personnel executive  finance and accounting  information technology  human resources  legal and administrative  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  or of total revenue for fiscal as compared to  or of total revenue for fiscal and  or of total revenue for fiscal the increase for fiscal as compared to fiscal  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue  is largely the result of personnel increases in support of the company s infrastructure  increased costs associated with the company s having gone public in fiscal  investments in internal systems and a one time charge in related to the move of the company s corporate headquarters 
the increases for fiscal as compared to fiscal were principally due to increased personnel 
general and administrative expenses are expected to decline as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal non recurring charge 
on january   the company acquired certain of the assets of borwick international  inc borwick  an international consulting firm which developed and marketed software known as successplan the product 
as part of this agreement  borwick was granted the exclusive right to distribute the product outside of north america  and the company was prohibited from selling any competitive products in these territories 
on september   the company entered into an agreement that terminated certain distribution rights of borwick to the product and removed any restrictions on the company s ability to sell competitive products 
in conjunction therewith  the company recorded a non recurring charge to operations of  in the fiscal year ended september   representing the present value of payments made and payable under the terms of this agreement 
other income  net other income increased to approximately in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal these increases are due to higher average cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances during each respective year  representing the proceeds raised from the company s initial public offering in july  the company expects to continue to yield investment income on its average balance of combined cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at an average rate comparable to that experienced for fiscal benefit provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate was  and for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the net loss in fiscal compared to the taxable income in prior periods 
the benefit generated from the net loss in fiscal related primarily to the federal tax benefit and was partially offset by minimum taxes due in certain state jurisdictions 
the increase in the effective tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal was due primarily to equity related compensation not benefitted for financial statement purposes 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has primarily financed its operations and capital expenditures through internally generated cash flow 
additional financing which has been secured by the company includes  of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock in january and  of net proceeds from the company s initial public offering in july  at september   the company had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of  a decrease of  from  at september  working capital was  at september  as compared to  at september   a decrease of  cash used in operating activities was  during the year ended september  use of cash in operating activities consisted mainly of the net loss for the fiscal year of  the offsetting effects of depreciation and amortization of  growth in deferred revenue of and the timing of receipts and disbursements  resulting in prepayment of certain expenses  increases in accounts receivable and fluctuations in certain liabilities 
the company used  in investing activities during the year ended september  investing activities consisted principally of the net purchase of short term investments of  the purchase of property and equipment primarily computer and networking equipment  peripherals and software which approximated  to support the corporate infrastructure and the launch of restrac webhire  and a cash deposit of for the company s new lease for its corporate headquarters 
this lease deposit included in other assets is interest bearing and its investment can be directed by the company 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september  was financing activities consisted of proceeds and tax benefit from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
to date  the company has not invested in derivative securities or any other financial instruments that involve a high level of complexity or risk 
cash has been  and the company contemplates that it will continue to be  invested in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
from time to time  the company may evaluate potential acquisitions of products  businesses and technologies that may complement or expand the company s business 
the company currently does not have any understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisitions 
any such transactions consummated may use a portion of the company s working capital or require the issuance of equity or debt 
the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances and cash provided by future operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
although operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  operating and investing activities may use cash in other periods 
consequently  any future growth may require the company to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
factors affecting future operating results the company operates in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves risks and uncertainties 
the following section lists some  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and management s discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended september    and potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company s results of operations have been  and may in the future be  subject to significant quarterly fluctuations  due to a variety of factors  including the relatively lengthy sales cycle for the company s products  the relatively large size of a typical product sale  the timing of contracts  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  capital spending patterns of customers  the company s sales incentive strategy which is based in part on annual sales targets and general economic conditions 
historically  revenue in each of the first two fiscal quarters has been lower than in the preceding fourth fiscal quarter which typically has the highest revenue and net income  due largely to sales incentive programs 
a substantial portion of the company s revenue often occurs during the last few weeks of each quarter  therefore  any delays in orders or shipments are more likely to result in revenue not being recognized until the following quarter 
the company s current expense levels are based in part on its expectations of future revenue and  as a result  net income for a given period could be disproportionately affected by any reduction in revenue 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve significant revenue  that the level of revenue in the future will not decrease from past levels or that in some future quarter the company s revenue or operating results will not be below the expectations of stock market securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the company s profitability and price of its common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
emerging markets the company s future success is substantially dependent on broader recognition of the potential benefits afforded by automated staffing software and services and the growth in demand for such solutions 
because the market for such software is developing  it is difficult to assess the size of the market  the customer demands that will evolve  and the competition that may emerge 
there can be no assurance that the market for automated staffing software and services will continue to grow or that the introduction of new technologies or services will not render the company s existing software and services obsolete or unmarketable 
the market for automated staffing solutions is undergoing rapid changes including continuing advances in technology and changes in customer requirements and preferences 
these market dynamics have been amplified by the emergence of the internet as a communications medium for staffing solutions 
the company s future success will depend in significant part on its ability to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of its software and services in response to the evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive product offerings  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
in addition  an element of the company s business strategy is the introduction of new products  functionalities and other staffing solutions that capitalize on the increasing use of the internet and corporate intranets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing products that will keep pace with technological changes in the market or new technologies introduced by competitors or that it will satisfy evolving consumer preferences 
development of internet and intranet based products  functionalities and other staffing solutions will also depend on increased acceptance of the internet for staffing solutions and the development of the necessary infrastructure to facilitate commercial applications on the internet 
there can be no assurance of such acceptance or infrastructure development 
failure to develop and introduce new products  functionalities and other staffing solutions in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on principal product the company currently derives most of its revenue from its restrac hire product 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting sales of this product would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the future success of the company also depends  in part  on achieving broader market acceptance of restrac hire  as well as the ability to continue to enhance restrac hire to meet the evolving needs of its customers 
moreover  the company anticipates that its existing and new competitors will introduce additional competitive products 
this competition may reduce future market acceptance of restrac hire 
the market acceptance of the company s software is difficult to estimate due in large measure to the effect of new products  applications or product enhancements  technological changes in the marketplace for staffing solutions and future competition 
there can be no assurance that the company will maintain and expand acceptance of restrac hire 
the failure of the company to maintain and expand its market acceptance as a result of competition  technological change or other factors would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of change the evolution of the company s business and expansion of the company s customer base has resulted in substantial growth in the number of its employees  the scope of its operation and financial systems and the geographic area of its operations  resulting in increased responsibility for management personnel 
the company s future results of operations will depend on the ability of its officers and other key employees to continue to implement its operational  customer support  and financial control systems and to expand  train  and manage its employee base 
although the company currently has no agreements  commitments  or understandings relating to any acquisitions  the company may undertake acquisitions in the future 
any such transactions would place additional strains upon the company s management resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any future expansion successfully  and any inability to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition the marketplace for staffing solutions is intensely competitive and is rapidly changing 
the company encounters direct competition from a number of companies providing staffing solutions  including i other human resource staffing software companies  ii providers of general human resource information systems  iii agencies providing or sourcing full time  contract and temporary labor  iv information systems departments of potential prospects that develop custom software  and v providers of other client server application software or document management systems 
the company s primary direct competitor is resumix  inc  which was acquired by ceridian  inc in the company also competes directly against other providers of human resource staffing software  most of which are small privately held companies providing less functional products at lower prices 
in addition  vendors of general human resource information systems generally include applicant tracking modules in their offerings which can compete with the company s products 
moreover  there can be no assurance that such vendors will not develop and market products in direct competition with the company 
some of the company s current and many of its potential competitors  including peoplesoft  ibm and many other providers of general human resource information systems  are large  publicly traded organizations with access to significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources 
as a result  they may be able to respond to market changes  emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements more rapidly and devote more resources to the development  marketing  and sales of their products than the company 
competition may increase from new market entrants particularly if the market for automated staffing solutions continues to develop or through consolidations in the software industry and or cooperative relationships among companies 
although the company believes that at the present time its products are competitively priced  an increase in competition could result in price reductions and loss of market share 
such competition and any resulting price reductions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on third parties a key element of the company s business strategy is to develop relationships with leading industry organizations in order to increase the company s market presence  expand distribution channels and broaden the company s product line 
the company believes that its continued success depends in large part on its ability to maintain such relationships and cultivate additional relationships 
there can be no assurance that the company s existing strategic partners such as peoplesoft or future strategic partners will not develop and market products in direct competition with the company or otherwise discontinue their relationships with the company  or that the company will be able to successfully develop additional strategic relationships 
in addition  certain technology incorporated in the company s software is licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis 
the termination of any of such licenses  or the failure of the third party licensers to adequately maintain or update their products  could result in delay in the company s ability to ship certain of its products while it seeks to implement technology offered by alternative sources 
in addition  any required replacement licenses could prove more costly than the company s current license relationships and might not provide technology as powerful and functional as the third party technology currently licensed by the company 
also  any such delay  to the extent it becomes extended or occurs at or near the end of a fiscal quarter  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for that quarter 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain other licenses relating to one or more of the company s products or relating to current or future technologies  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
reliance on single client interface and single server platform at the present time  the company supports client workstation platforms utilizing microsoft s windows family of software products  including windows  windows nt and windows if microsoft were to fundamentally change the architecture of its software product such that users of the company s software applications experienced significant performance degradation or were rendered incompatible with future versions of microsoft s windows operating system  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if a new client platform or other interface were to gain broad acceptance in the marketplace  there can be no assurance that the company s architecture would be compatible with such an interface 
certain products planned for release in fiscal will operate exclusively on microsoft s nt server and internet information server iis platforms 
if microsoft were to fundamentally change the architecture of its server product such that users of the company s software applications experienced significant performance degradation or were rendered incompatible with future versions of microsoft s nt server or iis  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if a new type of server were to gain broad acceptance in the marketplace  there can be no assurance that the company s architecture would be compatible with such a server 
risk of new product introductions  risk of product defects as the marketplace for staffing solutions continues to evolve  the company plans to develop and introduce new products and services to enable it to effectively address the changing needs of that market 
there is no guarantee that the company will be able to develop new products or services or that such solutions will achieve market acceptance or  if market acceptance is achieved  that the company will be able to maintain such acceptance for a significant period of time 
any inability of the company to quickly develop products and services that address changes in technology or customer demands may require the company to substantially increase development expenditures or result in loss of market share to a competitor 
products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions are released 
the company has in the past discovered software errors in certain of its product offerings after their introduction 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company  errors will not occur in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in adverse publicity  in loss of or delay in market acceptance  or in claims by the customer against the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends to a significant extent on its senior management and other key employees 
the company also believes that its future success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain additional key employees 
competition for such personnel in the computer software industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and training such personnel 
furthermore  although the company is a party to non competition agreements with each of its senior executives  the laws governing such agreements are in continual flux and the enforceability of such agreements in each jurisdiction in which enforcement might be sought is uncertain 
the company s inability to attract and retain additional key employees or the loss of one or more of its current key employees could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of international expansion although international sales have not been significant to date  an element of the company s business strategy is the expansion of its existing international operations and entry into additional international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
to the extent that the company is unable to make the investments required to expand in a timely manner  the company s growth  if any  in international sales will be limited  and the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for its products 
additional risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and difficulties associated with localizing products for foreign countries  lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and political and economic instability 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international sales or the company s overall business  financial condition and results of operations 
limited protection of intellectual property and dependence on proprietary rights  risk of litigation the company relies on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure agreements and other methods to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that the measures taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or independent development by others of similar technology 
in addition  the company may be subject to additional risk as it enters into transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or are poorly enforced 
the company s inability to protect its proprietary rights would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as the number of human resource application software products and services in the industry increases and the functionality of these solutions further overlaps  software developers and publishers may increasingly become subject to infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future with respect to current or future products 
although the company is not currently the subject of any intellectual property litigation  there has been substantial litigation regarding copyright  patent and other intellectual property rights involving computer software companies 
any claims or litigation  with or without merit  could be costly and could result in a diversion of management s attention  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
adverse determinations in such claims or litigation may require the company to obtain a license and or pay damages  which could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
volatility of stock price as is frequently the case with stock of high technology companies  the market price of the company s stock has been and may continue to be quite volatile 
factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  announcements of technological innovations by the company or its competitors or the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  and macroeconomic conditions in the computer software industries generally  may have a significant impact on the market price of the stock of the company 
if revenue or earnings in a quarter fail to meet expectations published or otherwise of the investment community  there could be an immediate impact on the company s stock price 
furthermore  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of the stock of the company 
product liability although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of products by the company and the incorporation of products from other companies may entail the risk of product liability claims 
the company s license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions intended to limit the company s exposure to such claims  but such provisions may not be effective in limiting the company s exposure 
a successful product liability action brought against the company could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
