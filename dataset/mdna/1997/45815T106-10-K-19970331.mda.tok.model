outlook this section captioned outlook and other parts of this annual report on form k include certain forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws 
actual results and the occurrence or timing of certain events could differ materially from those projected in any of such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this form k 
see other factors relating to forward looking statements below 
coulter s failure to purchase minimum purchase requirements  termination of coulter agreement  dispute with coulter and settlement agreement 
coulter s failure to purchase the minimum number of micro systems required to be purchased under the coulter agreement  the company s termination of the coulter agreement and the resulting dispute have adversely affected the company s business  results of operation  financial condition and expected performance for and the company believes these events have created confusion in the marketplace relating to service and pricing and may have led some customers to question the merits of the micro system and  in particular  have been a factor in the decision of some customers to return certain micro systems placed for evaluation 
the company firmly believes that the micro system meets market requirements and believes that many of the customers who returned evaluation systems  and other potential customers evaluating or considering an evaluation of the micro system  will order a micro system for evaluation  purchase or lease now that the dispute between the company and coulter is resolved 
the company also believes that the termination of its exclusive distribution relationship with coulter will ultimately better serve the company  permitting more flexibility in the development of marketing and sales programs and better penetration of the market due to greater potential pricing discounts as a result of higher potential gross margins 
under the settlement agreement  to the extent and for so long as the company sells the micro system through distributors other than coulter for resale or lease to end users  coulter shall have most favored distributor rights that consist of the right to purchase micro systems from the company on the same terms such systems are sold by the company to other distributors on a country by country basis  including and subject to all of the conditions of such sale transactions such as price  discounts  and quantity 
the most favored distributor rights terminate in the event i the company terminates the sale and marketing of the micro system through distributors other than coulter  but such rights shall be reinstated in the event the company recommences sales and marketing of the micro system through other distributors  or ii of a sale of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of the company  or a merger  consolidation  or reorganization of the company involving a change in control of the company 
coulter s most favored distributor rights effectively prevent the company from entering into exclusive distribution agreements with a third party distributor 
while the settlement agreement contemplates that coulter may purchase micro systems at a discount transfer price or otherwise from the company  for foreign placements  there are no minimum purchase requirements under the settlement agreement and there is no assurance that coulter will actively promote the sale and marketing of the micro system 
build up of the company s internal sales force 
costs and delays associated with the company s efforts to build its internal sales and service force in the wake of the termination of the coulter agreement are expected to adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition in however  the company believes that its understanding of the nature of and advantages of the use of the micro system and the training it provides and will provide to its internal sales  marketing and service force will ultimately position the company to achieve better results by selling micro systems directly to end users than the company has realized or could realize with an exclusive distribution relationship with one distributor 
in addition  the company s ability to set prices and to sell the micro system directly to end users will provide the company with a greater ability to enter into more flexible pricing arrangements with end users who lease or purchase a micro system 
such flexibility may increase the number of end users who are financially able to purchase or lease a micro system  result in increased margins on a per unit basis  and result in increased gross and net revenues to the company for and beyond 
however  there can be no guarantee or assurance that increased pricing flexibility and direct selling efforts by the company will result in an increase in the number of potential end users  an increase in sales  or greater margins or gross or net revenues 
in addition  while the company intends to focus its marketing and sales efforts on direct sales  the company may continue to sell micro systems to coulter pursuant to the settlement agreement and to other distributors for resale to customers  and substantial sales to distributors may be possible only at transfer prices substantially lower than projected prices for direct sales 
laboratory automation  product development 
the company believes that manual performance of clinical laboratory microscopic procedures are costly  time consuming and subject to varying degrees of accuracy and consistency 
the company anticipates that the demand for automated microscopy and its attendant ability to reduce laboratory costs and exposure to liability  enhance analytical accuracy and consistency  increase the productivity of medical technologists and improve patient care will continue to increase in the future 
the company s ability to react quickly to a rise in the demand for automated microscopy products by developing a product or line of products that will perform a broad number of microscopic procedures will be critical to the company s success 
the company intends to seek to develop  either internally or through licensing arrangements such as those entered into with diasys and monogen  products that can meet such demand for a variety of automated microscopic procedures 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not develop such products before the company can  or that any products developed by the company  even if timely  will receive sufficient fda clearance or approval or will meet with greater market acceptance than those manufactured by the company s competitors 
health care cost containment considerations 
the company believes that pressure in the health care industry to control and contain patient care costs has increased and will continue to increase 
such pressure may result in increased demand for the micro system from those end users who can benefit from the cost savings and other benefits provided by the micro system because they will continue to perform the same type and volume of clinical laboratory microscopic procedures 
if  however  such cost containment pressures result in an actual reduction in the number and type of clinical laboratory microscopic procedures performed ie  a reduction in precautionary testing  the cost savings and other benefits of the micro systems would decrease  and accordingly  demand for the micro system may also decrease 
consolidation of management of health care facilities 
the continuing trend toward consolidation of laboratories and hospitals by acquisitions and through the formation of affiliated and nonaffiliated purchasing groups will create opportunities for penetration of the market by sales efforts directed at the principal decision makers for such groups and  at the same time  may make penetration of the market more difficult if sales of micro systems are not made to such large purchasing groups 
license and other arrangements with other companies 
the company expects that it will increase market penetration opportunities through the product integration arrangement it has made with diasys and the license arrangement it has made with monogen 
the expense of up to  for research and development contracts and  in cash or common stock  as licensing fees under the arrangement with monogen will impact the extent of the company s liquidity and available capital  however  these arrangements  including in particular the new procedures developed  should open new opportunities to expand market penetration
