the company s primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operations  proceeds from the sale of the notes discussed above  and borrowings under the credit agreement 
the company had working capital of million  million and million at the end of  and  respectively 
historically  the company s working capital has been at its lowest level in january and february  and has increased through november as inventory buildup is financed with both short term and long term borrowings in preparation for the fourth quarter selling season 
in and  as inventories were reduced by sales in december and january  working capital was also reduced as the net proceeds from these sales were used to reduce outstanding long term borrowings under the credit agreement 
in cash generated by december and january sales resulted in larger cash balances as no amount was outstanding under the credit agreement after the sale of notes in march net cash used in operating activities was million in net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million in and in these amounts primarily represent net earnings plus depreciation and amortization and changes in non current other liabilities  offset by increases in inventories and other non cash working capital 
the increase in inventories of million in  million in and million in resulted from the addition of inventory for new stores opened and stores expected to be opened shortly after the year end  backstocking and the purchase of fabric used in the direct sourcing of inventory 
capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively

such assets include  but are not limited to  trademarks  tradenames  customer lists  non compete agreements and license agreements 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities includes the net proceeds of public offerings of common stock of million and million in and  respectively  proceeds from sale of notes of million in net of million in related costs  as well as borrowings under the company s revolving credit facilities 
cash used in financing activities is principally comprised of repayments of amounts outstanding under the company s revolving credit facilities 
the company s primary cash requirements are to finance working capital increases for its peak selling season and fund capital expenditure requirements anticipated to be between approximately million and million for this amount includes the anticipated costs of opening approximately new stores in at an expected average cost per store of between approximately  to  excluding telecommunications and point of sale equipment and inventory 
the balance of the capital expenditures for will be used for telecommunications  point of sale and other computer equipment  for store remodeling and expansion  warehousing and distribution and real estate 
the company anticipates that each of the approximately new stores will require  on average  an initial inventory costing approximately  subject to the same seasonal patterns affecting inventory at all stores  which will be funded by the company s revolving credit facility  trade credit and cash from operations 
the actual amount of future capital expenditures and inventory purchases will depend in part on the number of new stores opened and the terms on which new stores are leased

any such acquisitions may be undertaken as an alternative to opening new stores 
the company has recently received  and from time to time in the past has received  inquiries concerning its interest in possible acquisitions and has requested information with respect thereto 
the company may use cash on hand  together with its cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit agreement  to take advantage of significant acquisition opportunities

in connection with the company s direct sourcing program  the company may enter into purchase commitments that are denominated in a foreign currency 
the company generally enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk of currency fluctuations related to such commitments 
the majority of the forward exchange contracts are with one financial institution 
therefore  the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by this party 
however  due to the creditworthiness of this major financial institution  full performance is anticipated 
the company may also be exposed to market risk as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates 
this market risk should be substantially offset by changes in the valuation of the underlying transactions being hedged 
impact of new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 earnings per share sfas  in february sfas is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after december   including interim periods  earlier application is permitted 
this statement establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share eps and applies to entities with publicly held common stock or potential common stock 
sfas simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share previously found in apb opinion no 
and makes them comparable to international eps standards 
it replaces the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps 
it also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted eps on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the diluted eps computation 
basic eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity 
diluted eps is computed similarly to fully diluted eps pursuant to opinion forward looking statements certain statements made herein and in other public filings and releases by the company contain forward looking information as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of that involve risk and uncertainty 
these forward looking statements may include  but are not limited to  future sales  earnings  margins  costs  number and costs of store openings  demand for men s clothing  market trends in the retail men s clothing business  currency fluctuations  inflation and various economic and business trends 
forward looking statements may be made by management orally or in writing  including but not limited to  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and other sections of the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission under the securities exchange act of and the securities act of actual results and trends in the future may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  domestic economic activity and inflation  the company s successful execution of internal operating plans and new store and new market expansion plans  performance issues with key suppliers  foreign currency fluctuations  government export and import policies and legal proceedings 
future results will also be dependent upon the ability of the company to continue to identify and complete successful expansions and penetrations into existing and new markets and its ability to integrate such expansions with the company s existing operations
