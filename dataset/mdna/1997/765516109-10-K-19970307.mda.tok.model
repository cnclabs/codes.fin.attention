item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following information should be read along with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements on page f through f results of operations compared with sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million over the amount of million 
century contributed nearly million of this increase due largely to favorable weather conditions in most of it s market areas and to geographical expansion 
a significant portion of this expansion has occurred in the eastern half of the country from north carolina to new jersey 
presently  century has branches 
as has been noted earlier  cbe s sales reflects a full year for it was acquired effective march  cbe s sales in  on a full year basis  have increased more than over levels principally due to expansion through the acquisition of two businesses in maine and another in los angeles  california 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million an increase of million or approximately over the amount of million 
this increase is due primarily to the higher sales noted above 
while cbe continued to experience declining typewriter maintenance revenues  its overall gross profit percentage was about the same as the prior year 
selling  general and administration expenses for the year ended december  increased million or to million from million for the year ended december  the geographical expansion noted above accounted for nearly million of this increase 
the balance of this increase relates to cbe s costs associated with acquiring and expanding into three new market areas during and to higher goodwill amortization charges 
million principally associated with the typewriter contract maintenance business 
interest expense  net for the year ended december  increased 
million or over the year earlier period to million 
this increase reflects the higher term debt and higher line of credit facility incurred in acquiring the various businesses noted above and in carrying the higher working capital  partially offset by a slightly lower borrowing rate 
the federal  state and foreign income tax provision for the year ended december  was 
million  a decrease of approximately 
million from last year 
the lower tax rate is principally due the recognition of deferred tax benefit associated with the goodwill amortization and to lower state taxes 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or 
per share 
this compares with million or 
per share reported for the year ended december  the higher net income is due principally to higher sales 
compared with sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million over the amount of million 
the acquisition of cbe in march contributed million of the increase see acquisitions 
the balance of the increase was principally due to acquisitions by century of additional branches in georgia and virginia and to increased penetration of existing markets 
the markets served by century had generally favorable weather conditions throughout the selling season 
the cbe results reflect approximately improvement over that experienced by its predecessor company in the increase was driven by higher sales of computer maintenance contracts and network installations  offset by a decline in typewriter maintenance contract revenues 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased million to million  over the amount of million 
the sales increase noted above contributed to all of the gross profit increase 
cbe s gross profit percentage was below prior year results due principally to decline in typewriter maintenance contracts  which carry a high gross profit percentage 
thus  while sales and gross profit for cbe increased year to year  gross profit percentage declined 
the company expects this trend of declining typewriter based revenue to continue 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million to million from million reported for the year ended december  the addition of cbe accounted for million of the increase 
included in the administrative expenses for cbe for the period ended december  was a million charge attributable to the impairment of goodwill 
this charge relates to the typewriter portion of cbe s business  which as noted  above experienced a decline in sales below that reported last year 
the balance of the increase in selling and administrative expenses is principally due to the increase in the number of century branches 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to from 
million in the year ended december  
the increase is principally due to the additional term debt for the acquisition of cbe  partially offset by lower borrowing for working capital 
federal and state income tax provision for the year ended december  was approximately million  an increase of approximately 
million over the year ended december  the effective higher tax rate for is principally due to a 
million non recurring charge included in the amount relating to federal tax audit of century s prior year tax returns 
net income for the year ended december  was million or 
per share 
this compares with the million or 
per share reported for the year ended december  the higher net income is due to higher sales 
financial condition the company s financial condition continues to improve 
the net worth as of december  has increased to million 
tangible net worth  which at the end of was nil has increased to nearly million as of december  the company still has million of term and subordinated debt outstanding at december  this compares to million outstanding at the end of last year 
as was noted last year  the company continues to rely on short term borrowings to finance it s working capital 
during the first quarter of each year century s working capital requirements are at a low point  with short term borrowings  historically  of million 
during the second quarter working capital requirements begin to expand and by july of each year the amount necessary to carrying the working capital historically expands to approximately million 
from july through the remainder of the year  receivables are liquidated  releasing substantial amounts of cash that may be used to reduce short term debt 
the operating cash flow of the company before working capital requirements improved to million from million last year 
the company was thus able to retire nearly million of term and subordinated debt which came due during the year 
this amount is approximately the same as last year 
at december  working capital has increased approximately million to million from million last year 
acquisitions accounted for nearly million of this increase and the balance came from operations driven by higher sales financed in part by operating cash flow 
during the second quarter of the company for the second time in as many years renegotiated its revolving credit facility and long term debt agreement with michigan national bank 
the revised agreement a lowered the rate of interest charged on the line of credit to prime less an eighth from prime  b offered a lower rate of interest on the term debt and c converted million of line of credit facility to term debt without increasing the quarterly repayment amount 
century and cbe s expansion into new markets was financed by the increase in the term debt 
though the company has continued to generate sufficient cash to liquidate its term and subordinated debt as it becomes due  and make acquisitions necessary for it s growth  there is no assurance  given the high degree of leverage  the seasonality of its principal business  and the decreasing availability of the deferred tax benefit currently at million that it can continue to do so in the future
