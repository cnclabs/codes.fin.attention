recent accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  became effective for the company s fiscal year ended january  sfas no 
 earnings per share  was issued in february and becomes effective for the company s fiscal year ending january  sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
it also requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the implementation of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements in fiscal sfas no 
provides a choice of adopting its fair value based method of expense recognition for stock based awards granted to employees or applying the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the company continues to apply the accounting provisions of apb no 
and has adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
in  consequently  sfas no 
had no effect on the company s financial position or results of operations in fiscal sfas no 
modifies the way in which earnings per share eps is calculated and disclosed 
currently  the company discloses primary and fully diluted eps 
upon adoption of this standard for the fiscal year ending january   the company will disclose basic and diluted eps for fiscal and will restate all prior period eps data presented 
basic eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps  similar to fully diluted eps  reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity 
if the company had adopted sfas no 
for fiscal  basic eps would have been per share versus reported for primary eps 
diluted eps would have been per share  unchanged from fully diluted eps reported in recent developments on october   the company announced its intention to spin off its bj s wholesale club division in a tax free distribution the distribution that will take the form of a special dividend to stockholders 
on november   the company filed a ruling request with the internal revenue service irs with respect to the tax free status of the distribution and filed preliminary proxy materials with the securities and exchange commission sec 
the company has since received a ruling from the irs that the distribution will qualify as a tax free transaction for the company and its stockholders 
shortly after filing this annual report on form k  the company expects to file a registration statement with the sec in connection with the proposed distribution and  following the effectiveness of such registration statement  to mail proxy materials to stockholders 
the company also expects to call for redemption its convertible subordinated debentures after the registration statement becomes effective 
the company expects to hold a stockholders meeting in june to vote on several related proposals  including approval of the distribution  which will separate the company s food and general merchandise warehouse club business bj s wholesale club from its home improvement warehouse business homebase 
after the distribution  bj s wholesale club  inc  bji a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of the company  will be an independent  publicly owned company that will operate and develop bj s business 
the company s stockholders will also be asked to approve an amendment to waban inc s certificate of incorporation changing the name of the company to homebase  inc  which will continue to operate and develop homebase s business after the distribution 
other proposals to be voted upon include an amendment to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the company s stock incentive plan and to approve certain incentive plans for bji 
the distribution is conditioned upon a number of other factors  including i declaration of the distribution by the board of directors  ii the conversion into common stock or the redemption for cash of waban inc s convertible subordinated debentures and  if these debentures are redeemed for cash  the closing of an equity offering by bji to reduce the indebtedness that the company would incur to finance the redemption  and iii bji and homebase  inc having obtained bank credit facilities in amounts deemed necessary by the company s management 
prior to the distribution  the company also intends to repay its million senior notes due may  and retire via open market or privately negotiated purchase or a tender offer or defease its million senior subordinated notes due may   with proceeds from bank borrowings 
the company currently expects the distribution to be completed in july however  the company s board of directors has reserved the right to abandon  defer or modify the distribution at any time prior to its completion
