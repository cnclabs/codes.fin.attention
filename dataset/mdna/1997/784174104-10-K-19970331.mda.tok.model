item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations basis of presentation the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
the following discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  risks and uncertainties relating to leverage  the need for additional funds  consummation of the pending acquisitions  integration of the recently completed acquisitions  the ability of the company to achieve certain cost savings  the management of growth  the introduction of new technology  changes in the regulatory environment  the popularity of radio as a broadcasting and advertising medium and changing consumer tastes 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances 
general the company currently owns and operates  provides programming to or sells advertising on behalf of radio stations located in markets 
following completion of the pending acquisitions and the pending dispositions  the company will own and operate  provide programming to or sell advertising on behalf of radio stations located in markets 
the performance of a radio station group  such as the company  is customarily measured by its ability to generate broadcast cash flow 
broadcast cash flow is defined as net revenues including  where applicable  fees earned by the company pursuant to the scmc termination agreement as defined herein less station operating expenses 
although broadcast cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company believes that broadcast cash flow is accepted by the broadcasting industry as a generally recognized measure of performance and is used by analysts who report publicly on the performance of broadcasting companies 
nevertheless  this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  net income  net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining the company s operating performance or liquidity which is calculated in accordance with gaap 
the primary source of the company s revenue is the sale of advertising time on its radio stations 
pursuant to an agreement with scmc the scmc termination agreement  the company receives fees for certain financial consulting and administrative services provided to triathlon 
fee revenue from the scmc termination agreement will fluctuate principally based upon the level of acquisition and financing activity of triathlon  above the minimum annual fees of  the company s most significant station operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses and advertising and promotional expenditures 
the company strives to control these expenses by working closely with local station management 
the company s revenues are primarily affected by the advertising rates its radio stations can obtain in the face of competition from radio and other media 
the company s advertising rates are in large part based on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by arbitron an independent rating service on a quarterly basis 
because audience ratings in local markets are crucial to a station s financial success  the company endeavors to develop strong listener loyalty 
the company believes that the diversification of formats on its stations helps to insulate it from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public in any particular format 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings is limited in part by the format of a particular station 
the company s stations strive to maximize revenue by constantly managing the number of commercials available for sale and adjusting prices based upon local competitive conditions 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements which exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging  instead of for cash 
the company seeks to minimize its use of such agreements 
the company s advertising contracts are generally short term 
the company generates most of its revenue from local advertising  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff 
in  approximately of the company s revenues were from local advertising 
to generate national advertising sales  the company engages independent advertising sales representatives that specialize in national sales for each of its stations 
the radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive and the company s stations are located in highly competitive markets 
the financial results of each of the company s stations are dependent to a significant degree upon its audience ratings and its share of the overall advertising revenue within the station s geographic market 
each of the company s stations competes for audience share and advertising revenue directly with other fm and am radio stations  as well as with other media  within their respective markets 
the company s audience ratings and market share are subject to change  and any adverse change in audience rating and market share in any particular market could have a material and adverse effect on the company s net revenues 
although the company competes with other radio stations with comparable programming formats in most of its markets  if another station in the market were to convert its programming format to a format similar to one of the company s radio stations  if a new radio station were to adopt a competitive format  or if an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations  the company s stations could suffer a reduction in ratings or advertising revenue and could require increased promotional and other expenses 
in addition  certain of the company s stations compete  and in the future other stations may compete  with groups of stations in a market operated by a single operator 
as a result of the telecom act  the radio broadcasting industry has become increasingly consolidated  resulting in the existence of radio broadcasting companies which are significantly larger  with greater financial resources  than the company 
furthermore  the telecom act will permit other radio broadcasting companies to enter the markets in which the company operates or may operate in the future 
although the company believes that each of its stations is able to compete effectively in its market  there can be no assurance that any of the company s stations will be able to maintain or increase current audience ratings and advertising revenue market share 
the company s stations also compete with other advertising media such as newspapers  television  magazines  billboard advertising  transit advertising and direct mail advertising 
radio broadcasting is also subject to competition from new media technologies that are being developed or introduced  such as the delivery of audio programming by cable television systems or the introduction of digital audio broadcasting 
the company cannot predict the effect  if any of these new technologies may have on the radio broadcasting industry 
in addition to its radio station operations  in the first quarter of  the company through completed and pending acquisitions  became one of the leading promoters of music concerts and other entertainment events 
the company anticipates that the primary source of revenues from its concert promotion activities will be from the sale of tickets at events which the company promotes 
the company anticipates that the most significant expenses with respect to its concert promotion activities will be talent and other expenses associated with producing an event 
the booking of talent in the concert promotion business generally involves contracts for limited engagements often involving a small number of performances 
the company believes that the concert promotion business is highly competitive  and will compete with other live entertainment  including sports activities as well as the electronic entertainment industry 
the company s revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  the company s first calendar quarter generally produces the lowest revenues for the year  and the fourth calendar quarter generally produces the highest revenues for the year 
the company s operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of the advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 
the company anticipates that the second and third quarters will reflect the highest revenues from the company s concert promotion activities 
results of operations the company s consolidated financial statements tend not to be directly comparable from period to period due to acquisition activity
