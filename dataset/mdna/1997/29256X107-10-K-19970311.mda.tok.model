the company impaired the remaining goodwill   at december   associated with the ipi purchase due to the expected consolidation of ipi operations into tbc s in the first half of and charged  to expense during costs related to restructuring ipi 
the change in operating expenses would have been and for the years to and to respectively  without these charges 
the increase from to was primarily due to increases related to the costs associated with the clinical trials of novastan r 
the increase from to was primarily due to inclusion of a full year of costs for ipi and increased costs associated with the clinical trials of novastan r

liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its research and development activities to date principally through i private sales of common stock and an initial public offering of a unit security  ii issuances of common stock in conjunction with assumption of liabilities and assets to acquire ipi and the novastan r license  iii revenues from research and collaborative agreements and iv investment income  net of interest expense 
the company expects to incur substantial research and development expenditures as it designs and develops biopharmaceutical products for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases 
the company anticipates that operating expenses will continue to increase during and subsequent years 
the company began to incur costs to develop novastan r during the third quarter of these costs will continue during due to the continuation of clinical trials and will continue to be significant through the fda approval process and additional clinical trial work for other clinical indications 
these costs include  among other things  hiring personnel to direct and carry out all operations related to the clinical trials  paying for hospital and procedural costs  services of a contract research organization  and purchasing and formulating large quantities of the compound to be used in such trials 
in addition  the company anticipates that the administrative costs associated with this effort will be significant 
the amounts and timing of expenditures will depend on the progress of ongoing research and clinical development and product launch costs 
at december  and december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million and million  respectively 
in february  the company completed a private placement offering with net proceeds of approximately million 
the company consolidated the ipi operations into tbc s during  which had a positive impact on liquidity 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources should be sufficient to fund its cash requirements into the third quarter of this date is contingent upon various factors  including rate of patient enrollment and spending rate for the clinical trials of novastan r  selectin and endothelin compounds  and expenditures on research and development of other compounds 
however  the company s existing capital resources will not be sufficient to fund the company s operations through commercialization of its first product 
moreover  the genentech and synthelabo agreements require the company to maintain a tangible net worth of at least million during the term of the agreements 
if the company fails to maintain the prescribed net worth or fails to exercise due diligence in performing its obligations under the genentech agreement  genentech may  at its option  terminate the genentech agreement or cause the license to become non exclusive 
for failure to maintain at least million of net worth  synthelabo may require that the technology be transferred to  and the development program be conducted by  a joint venture owned by tbc and synthelabo 
the outcome of certain lawsuits that have been filed against the company could also have an impact on liquidity 
the company will need to raise substantial funds for future operations and is actively seeking such funding through collaborative arrangements  public or private financing  including equity financing  and other arrangements 
the company expects that additional expenditures will be required if additional product candidates enter clinical trials which may require additional expenditures for laboratory space  scientific and administrative personnel  and services of contract research organizations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or in time to fund any necessary or desirable expenditures 
in the event such financing are not obtained  the company s development and research projects will be delayed or scaled back 
see item legal proceedings 
hazardous materials and environmental matters the company s research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials 
the company is subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products 
management believes that the company is in compliance with all such laws  regulations and standards currently in effect and that the cost of compliance with such laws  regulation  and standards will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company does not expect to incur any capital expenditures for environmental control in the foreseeable future 
impact of inflation and changing prices the pharmaceutical research industry is labor intensive  and wages and related expenses increase in inflationary periods 
the lease of space and related building services for the houston facility contains a clause that escalates rent and related services each year based on the increase in building operating costs and the increase in the houston consumer price index  respectively 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on operations
