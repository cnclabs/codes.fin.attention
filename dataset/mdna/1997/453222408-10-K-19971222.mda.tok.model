the charge included  of costs associated with lease costs and related equipment write offs associated with the closing of eight pharmacies  the consolidation of seven sites in multi site markets and the relocation of eight other sites to more economical locations and  of severance costs related to administrative staff reductions 
as a result of the restructuring  the company anticipates a reduction in future general and administrative expenses including rent and personnel charges

liquidity capital resources during fiscal the company s cash and cash equivalents decreased  to  at september  the decrease in cash was principally a result of the payment of preferred stock dividends see note to the financial statements 
approximately  and of revenue for the years ended september   and  respectively  was derived from services provided to medicare beneficiaries 
payments for these services are made by the medicare program based on reimbursable costs incurred in rendering the services 
medicare makes interim payments as services are rendered  and the company files cost reports on an annual basis which are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by medicare 
the company reports revenue only for those costs that it believes are probable as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
of recovery under the applicable medicare statutes and regulations and reports its accounts receivable balances at net realizable value 
the company utilizes an extensive system of internal controls to attempt to ensure such proper reporting of revenues 
the company employs personnel with significant medicare reimbursement experience to prepare its cost reports and to monitor its operations on an ongoing basis to identify and seek to minimize those costs which are not reimbursed 
as a part of its system of internal controls  the company uses a detailed analysis process in calculating its medicare revenue at the time services are rendered 
this process considers the nature and amounts of the disputed costs as described in more detail below along with several authoritative  legal and historical sources of information including applicable statutes and regulations  such as those contained in the title xviii of the social security act  particularly sec 
v a reasonable cost and cfr cost related to patient care  health care financing administration hcfa publication health insurance manual  applicable sections of hcfa publication provider reimbursement manual and intermediary letters and program memoranda issued by hcfa 
administrative decisions and rulings on related issues by the department of health and human services provider reimbursement review board prrb and administrative law judges 
judicial decisions from federal district courts on relevant cases 
consultation with independent industry experts such as medicare cost reimbursement consultants 
opinions of outside legal counsel who specialize in dealing with medicare reimbursement issues 
historical knowledge gained internally from past medicare audits 
meetings and other communication with medicare intermediaries  the blue cross association and hcfa 
this detailed analysis process is updated on a quarterly basis  taking into account any new information such as decisions relating to the company s disputed costs  and administrative and judicial decisions relating to similar issues that may affect the determination of the net realizable value of accounts receivable or of liabilities to repay amounts received for disputed costs 
results of this detailed analysis process are extrapolated to other unaudited cost reporting years  including operations that have not yet been audited by medicare  to estimate the gross amount of reimbursement that would be affected 
the company  through this ongoing control and monitoring process  provides a reserve by means of a revenue reduction for any costs incurred which the company believes are not probable of recovery 
this reserve is reported as a reduction of accounts receivable for disputed costs for which the company may not ultimately receive payment 
the company also reports as a liability disputed costs for which it has received payment  but which may have to be returned to medicare 
accordingly  the company believes that its accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value  and that it has recorded all probable liabilities for repayment of disputed costs 
over the years  medicare auditors employed by the medicare fiscal intermediaries have  in connection with their retrospective audit process  taken certain positions with respect to certain types of costs  claiming that they are not reimbursable and thus not recoverable by the company from the medicare program 
these positions are based on interpretations promulgated after the period covered by the cost reports and applied retroactively  on interpretations of cost reimbursement principles that are contrary to the company s interpretations  or on what the company believes to be misapplications of specific reimbursement principles  that could not have been foreseen at the time services were rendered and revenue recorded 
these positions taken by medicare fiscal intermediaries are usually determined from medicare s notices of program reimbursement npr  which typically are not received until two to three years after the services are rendered 
in those situations where the company decides to not challenge an npr finding  any revenue relating to these costs  as well as the extrapolated impact  if any  on other open costs reporting years  if not written off or provided for earlier  is written off as a revenue reduction at that time 
the results of all nprs are included in the analysis process in calculating net medicare revenue as described above 
the company disagrees with the positions taken by the medicare fiscal intermediaries auditors and hcfa  and is vigorously pursuing these matters through administrative and legal channels 
the normal medicare administrative appeal process may take several years to resolve these types of disputes 
the company has established a reserve for the portion of these costs not considered probable of recovery 
as additional costs are incurred  the company is increasing the reserve to cover such additional costs that are not considered probable of recovery 
since the reserves have been established  the company has continued to review whether the level is appropriate 
the company currently has nprs challenging million of costs as of september  there was an additional million of costs at september  related to open cost reporting years that are similar to the costs that have been challenged on nprs 
together these amounts million at september  comprise the total amount the company considers to be disputed costs 
the major cost categories in dispute are the treatment of certain personnel costs relating to the company s community liaison positions  pharmacy indirect expenses  the cost of physical therapists employed by the company and certain other branch and corporate expenses 
during fiscal  the company settled various disputed nprs and received decisions from the prrb and the us district court regarding the community liaison and other disputed costs 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company was also notified by hcfa that pharmacy expenses retroactive to fiscal would be challenged 
as a result  a medicare reserve of million was recorded during the third quarter of fiscal and million was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal in august  the company received two rulings in which it was determined that community liaison costs are reimbursable to the degree that they are documented clearly enough to establish a differentiation between reimbursable and non reimbursable activities 
the rulings were from the us district court and from the prrb 
the us district court ruled that the company was not entitled to medicare reimbursement of community liaison costs incurred by some of its offices prior to june due to insufficient documentation  but was entitled to partial reimbursement of the costs by those offices for the period from june through september  based on daily activity records 
the prrb also ruled that a portion of community liaison costs incurred by some of its offices from fiscal through should be reimbursed 
the prrb specifically concluded that the costs for intake coordination activities are allowable  and that the costs for assessment evaluation  patient status and coordination are allowable where patient names are provided 
the prrb found  with respect to education activities and the provision of information to referral sources  that repeat visits to the same referral sources would be viewed as marketing and patient solicitation  which is unallowable 
in each of these decisions  the medicare intermediaries determinations that all community liaison costs are non reimbursable was reversed  and it was ordered that the matter be remanded for further action or audit 
because the decisions of the court and the prrb clarified the definition of allowable activities and the required documentation to support allowable activities  the company has changed its determination of recoverability on all community liaison costs 
of the total disputed costs of  at september  regarding the community liaison issues  the company has established reserves of  the company believes that in applying the decisions of the us district court and the prrb  the remaining  of costs are recoverable 
the company received  in march  a favorable ruling by the prrb on the physical therapist issue 
in may  this ruling was reversed by the hcfa administrator 
the company appealed the decision to the us federal district court in minneapolis 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company was notified that the us district court granted the company s motion to set aside the decision by hcfa which denied the company reimbursement of some of its costs for providing physical therapy services provided in the court found that hcfa had provided an insufficient explanation of its decision  and therefore  the decision was arbitrary and capricious 
the court remanded the matter to the secretary of the department of health and human services for further proceeding consistent with its order 
in october  hcfa  in response to the us district court s order  issued its revised decision in which it again ruled that the physical therapist costs at issue are not reimbursable by medicare 
the company  based on its assessment and the opinion of legal counsel  continues to believe this position is without merit and that the company will ultimately be reimbursed for the disputed physical therapy case 
as of september   the company  based on its analysis process  believes that recovery of  of total disputed costs including the extrapolated impact may not be probable and  accordingly  has established reserves which totaled that amount as of september  total accounts receivable net of reserves due from medicare at september  were  including the receivables net of reserves for disputed costs of  as of september  the company had received  in payments from medicare for disputed costs 
medicare may seek repayment for such amounts and accordingly  the potential liability for repayments is recorded as accrued liabilities third party 
the company believes it is probable that it has not incurred any other liability to repay disputed costs 
in view of the expectation that resolution of the disputed costs will not likely be accomplished within the next twelve months  related net receivables of  as of september  have been classified as a non current asset 
the ultimate settlement of the  liability for payments for medicare for disputed costs will impact the company s cash flow depending on when settlement is reached and the method of repayment 
the company intends to meet both its short and long term liquidity needs with its current cash balances and future cash flows from operations 
operating activities used  in cash during and provided  and  in cash during and  respectively 
total accounts receivable current and long term decreased during  increased during and decreased during the decrease during was due primarily to the additions to the medicare reserve of  the increase in was due primarily to the increase in disputed costs 
the decrease during was due to improved collection efforts and timing of payments from medicare 
investing activities provided  in cash during investing activities used  and  in cash during and  respectively 
in connection with expansion of the company s operations  the company acquired property and purchased software  which was funded by  of cash in   in cash and  of capitalized leases in  and  in cash and  of capitalized leases in during  financing activities principally used  in cash for the payment of long term debt and  for the payment of preferred dividends 
financing activities generated  in cash during as a result of issuance of preferred stock and warrants as mentioned in note to the financial statements 
issuance of stock in was offset by payments of preferred dividends of  and repayments of long term debt of  financing activities used  in cash during  principally for repayment of long term debt 
the company has letter of credit facilities for  the letters of credit are collateralized by secured investments and will expire in and forward looking information the company faces a number of risks 
information contained in this section is forward looking and involves risks and uncertainties that could significantly effect expected results 
the company s outlook for fiscal is predominantly based upon its interpretation of what it considers key economic assumptions 
currently  medicare reimburses participating medicare certified home health agencies for the reasonable costs incurred to provide covered visits to eligible beneficiaries  subject to certain cost limits which vary according to geographic regions of the country 
the budget act requires hcfa to implement a prospective payment system for home health agencies by october   with up to a four year phase in period 
prospective rates determined by hhs would reflect a reduction to the cost limits and per patient limits as of september  in the event the implementation deadline is not met  the reduction will be applied to the reimbursement system then in place 
the impact of such a change  if implemented  on the company s results of operations cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and would depend  to a large extent  on the reimbursement rates for home nursing established on an interim basis and under the prospective payment system 
there can be no assurances that such reimbursement rates  if enacted  would cover the costs incurred by the company to provide home nursing services 
until prospective payment takes effect on october   the budget act sets up an interim payment system the ips that provides for lowering of reimbursement limits for home health visits 
cost limit increases for fiscal and have been eliminated 
in addition  for cost reporting periods beginning on october   home health agencies cost limits will be determined as the lesser of i their actual costs ii cost limits based on of median costs of freestanding home health agencies or iii an agency specific per patient cost cap  based on of costs adjusted for inflation 
the company is unable to determine the effect of the ips until hcfa finalizes related regulatory guidance on the implementation of the ips 
the new cost limits will apply to the company for the cost reporting period beginning october  a reduction in these cost limits could have a significant affect on the company s results of operations  however  the effect of such reductions cannot be predicted with any level of certainty 
various other provisions included in the budget act may have an impact on the company s business and results of operations 
venipuncture will no longer be a covered skilled nursing home care service unless it is performed in connection with other skilled nursing services 
the company is currently assessing the potential impact of this provision  however  the effect of such reductions cannot be predicted with any level of certainty at this time 
additionally  the company will be required to have surety bonds of at least  for each medicare certified nursing agency 
in may  the clinton administration instituted ort  a health care fraud and abuse initiative focusing on nursing homes  home health care agencies and durable medical equipment companies located in the five states with the largest medicare populations 
the states initially targeted included california  florida  illinois  new york and texas 
ort has been responsible for millions of dollars in civil and criminal restitution  fines  recovery of overpayments and the exclusion of a number of individuals and corporations from the medicare program 
ort has been expanded to all fifty states  with a specific concentration on twelve states including arizona  colorado  georgia  louisiana  massachusetts  missouri  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee  virginia and washington 
private insurers and various state enforcement agencies also have increased their scrutiny of health care providers practices and claims  particularly in the home health and durable medical equipment areas 
no assurance can be given that the practices of the company  if reviewed  would be found to be in compliance with such laws or with any future laws  as such laws ultimately may be interpreted 
additionally  hcfa has implemented wedge surveys in at least states  including connecticut  florida  tennessee  illinois  indiana  massachusetts  minnesota  ohio  oklahoma  texas  utah  virginia and wyoming 
in these surveys  hcfa completes ort type surveys on a much smaller scale 
generally  hcfa extrapolates the percentage which was paid in error to all claims paid for the period under review 
assuming the reviewer uncovered nothing significant  the home health agency then has the option to repay the amount determined by hcfa or undergo a broader review of its claims 
if the survey uncovers significant problems  the matter may be referred for further review 
while the company believes that it is in material compliance with the fraud and abuse laws  there can be no assurance that the practices of the company  if reviewed  would be found to be in full compliance with such requirements  as such requirements ultimately may be interpreted 
it is the company s policy to monitor its compliance with such requirements and to take appropriate actions to attempt to ensure such compliance 
although the company does not believe it has violated any fraud and abuse laws  there can be no assurance that future related legislation  either health care or budgetary  related regulatory changes or interpretations of such regulations  will not have a material adverse effect on the future operations of the company 
the company is also effected by settlements which may be reached with the department of health and human services regarding cost reports and its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with referral sources  including payors  hospitals  physicians and other health care professionals
