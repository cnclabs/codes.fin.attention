this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements which are qualified by reference to  and should be read in conjunction with  the company s discussion regarding forward looking statements as set under forward looking statements 
spinoff on july   sprint corporation sprint announced that its board of directors decided to pursue a tax free spinoff of the company to sprint shareholders spinoff 
in the federal communications commission fcc auction of wireless personal communications services pcs licenses  sprint spectrum lp won the rights to several markets that overlap service territories operated by the company 
under fcc rules  sprint was required to divest or reduce its cellular holdings in certain markets to clear conflicts with the pcs licenses awarded to sprint spectrum lp 
for these reasons  sprint and its board of directors decided to pursue a spinoff of the cellular operations of sprint 
on march   the spinoff was consummated 
results of operations the following table sets forth the company s cellular service revenues  the components of certain operating expenses and the related percentage of cellular service revenues represented by each component for the years indicated in thousands 
results of cellular service operations year ended december  cellular service revenues    cost of service    other operations expense    sales  marketing and advertising expenses    general  administrative and other expenses    depreciation    customer growth rate the number of cellular customers increased to  in from  in and  in  an increase of and in and  respectively 
in and  the company added  and  customers  respectively  through internal growth 
in  the company added  customers through acquisitions 
the company s penetration rate  which is the number of customers divided by the total population in its licensed service areas  reached at december   compared with at december  annual penetration improvement from internal growth was in and in customer churn  the average monthly rate of customer disconnects  was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
historically  the company and the industry in general have experienced significant customer growth during the fourth quarter 
the company attained and of its annual internal growth customer gain in the and fourth quarter  respectively  and expects this trend to continue 
this trend is attributable to increases in cellular communications service activations during the holiday season 
revenue benefits associated with significant fourth quarter customer growth  however  are not experienced until subsequent quarters 
during the fourth quarter of each year  the company experiences significant increases in sales commission expenses as a result of the significant customer growth  which causes a deterioration in fourth quarter operating margins 
the company believes that more meaningful operating margins are reflected in subsequent periods after it experiences the revenue benefits of its significantly increased customer base 
cellular service revenues cellular service revenues increased in and  principally from growth in the number of cellular customers 
increased distribution channels  expanded network capacity  declining prices for cellular telephone equipment and service  increased consumer awareness and acceptance of wireless communications  and pricing plans targeted at particular market segments are key factors contributing to the company s customer growth 
the industry wide trend for lower negotiated roaming rates among carriers and generally lower revenue per customer has partially offset the revenue growth resulting from the increased customer base 
in addition  acquisitions completed in the first and fourth quarters of contributed million of service revenues 
consistent with the rest of the industry  the company has experienced increased penetration in the consumer market a trend attributable to declining cellular telephone equipment and service prices and increased promotional activities ie  packaging  special rate plans  an increased awareness of cellular communications  widespread distribution channels in consumer oriented retail locations and expanded network coverage and capacity 
the company expects this trend to continue 
new customers generally use less airtime than existing customers  causing the average service revenue per customer per month to decline 
as a result  cellular revenue growth has not kept pace with the level of growth in the number of customers 
service revenue per average customer per month was in  in and in the company anticipates that service revenue per average customer per month will continue to decline as penetration rates continue to increase 
the company expects that roaming rates between carriers will continue to be reduced as part of the industry wide effort to increase cellular telephone usage through increased roaming airtime  which may reduce revenues derived from cellular service users who roam into the company s systems 
the company projects roaming airtime will increase as reduced roaming rates between carriers are ultimately passed on to customers  thus stimulating increased usage 
roaming airtime minutes increased during and when compared with the prior years  resulting in increases of million and million in roaming revenue in those years 
future revenue growth will be impacted by the company s success in maintaining customer growth in existing markets  generating additional revenue from the increasing availability of a variety of enhanced and related services and products  and acquiring additional cellular communications systems to further strengthen its existing regional clusters 
the growth rate of new customers is expected to decline as the company s customer base grows 
future revenue growth also will be impacted by the company s entrance into the residential long distance and paging businesses 
in  the company began marketing residential long distance service and reselling paging service in of the states in which the company provides wireless service 
an improved competitive position  reduced cellular churn and increased brand awareness are expected as the company s long distance and paging services businesses mature 
equipment sales equipment sales decreased in and in compared with the prior years  despite an increase in the number of telephone units sold 
the price of cellular telephones is a key factor influencing the rate of customer growth 
although declining cellular telephone prices have generated increased activations of cellular service  negative gross margins on equipment sales continue to impact operating results as the company sells cellular telephones at or below cost 
competitive market pressures are expected to result in a continued trend of negative gross margins on equipment sales 
cost of service excluding the impact of roaming activities  cost of service as a percentage of cellular service revenues was in  in and in economies of scale and the favorable effects of renegotiated terms and conditions of a new long distance contract with sprint are key factors favorably impacting the trend in cost of service as a percentage of cellular service revenues 
long distance telecommunications and operator services are provided to the company by sprint based on terms and conditions of a contract governing such charges 
in march  a renegotiated agreement with a three year term was entered into between the company and sprint on an exclusive basis provided that sprint is able to provide such services at competitive terms and conditions on terms that are believed to be comparable to those which could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
in august  in an effort to level the competitive telecommunications field  the fcc issued an order that will result in a reduction in costs for wireless companies to interconnect with local telephone companies 
in addition  wireless companies will be compensated by landline carriers for calls terminating on wireless networks 
the new structure is intended to achieve reciprocal  cost based interconnection rates 
the company currently is renegotiating its interconnection arrangements with major telephone companies 
the company believes it will benefit from reduced interconnection rates 
roaming margins associated with the company s customers roaming into other carriers markets declined in  resulting in an increase in cost of service as a percent of cellular service revenues 
the decline in margins is attributable to increased competitive pressures to reduce rates for such roaming traffic and an increase in unbillable fraudulent roaming activities 
the company expects that the industry wide trend to reduce rates will continue  thus stimulating an increase in cellular telephone usage  resulting in an increase in roaming airtime 
to the extent reduced retail rates stimulate increased usage and the company is able to negotiate reduced wholesale roaming rates with other carriers  the effects of discounted rates will be somewhat mitigated 
unauthorized usage of customers telephone numbers  commonly referred to in the industry as cloning fraud  resulted in unbillable fraudulent roaming activities that approximated  and of cellular service revenues in  and  respectively 
significant fraud activity in several markets caused the increase in unbillable fraudulent roaming activity in in  the increase in unbillable fraudulent roaming activity was the result of a significant increase in the level of fraud activity in several markets during the fourth quarter of unbillable fraudulent roaming activities reached approximately of cellular service revenues in the three months ended december  the company believes it will continue to be impacted by fraudulent roaming activities on a going forward basis and continues to productively invest in new systems and technologies to reduce the incidence of fraud 
other operations expense other operations expense as a percent of cellular service revenues was in  in and in in  nonrecurring charges and the effects of an overall increase in the level of customer debt delinquencies nationwide more than offset realized economies of scale  causing an increase in other operations expense as a percent of cellular service revenues 
in  the company incurred approximately  of additional maintenance expense caused by two major hurricanes and  of increased expense for the testing of cell sites to ensure compliance with new environmental protection laws 
bad debt expense as a percentage of cellular service revenues increased to in from in and in the decrease in costs as a percentage of cellular service revenues in compared with was due primarily to the growth in the number of cellular customers and an improvement in bad debt levels 
the company expects that other operations expense as a percentage of cellular service revenues will decrease as future economies of scale are realized 
sales  marketing and advertising expenses sales  marketing and advertising expenses as a percentage of cellular service revenues were in  in and in in  additional advertising  promotional and other marketing expenses associated with the introduction and promotion of the company s new brand name  and with the initiation of residential long distance service  increased expenses by million and million  respectively 
these factors caused sales  marketing and advertising expenses as a percent of cellular service revenues to increase in during  sales distribution channel efficiencies were realized causing a decrease in costs as a percent of cellular service revenues when compared with to improve sales and reduce costs associated with acquiring new customers  the company has begun to depend more upon its own sales force working out of company retail outlets and kiosks located in shopping malls and other non company owned retail locations 
incremental sales costs at a company retail store or kiosk are significantly lower than commissions paid to national dealers 
although the company intends to continue to support its large dealer network  continued increases in its own retail distribution channels are planned 
the company has experienced little change in churn levels  a factor further contributing to the company s ability to manage the costs of maintaining and growing its customer base 
general  administrative and other expenses general  administrative and other expenses as a percentage of cellular service revenues were in  in and in the decrease in was due to economies of scale realized as a result of customer growth 
in connection with the spinoff  the company began to perform certain functions previously provided by sprint 
the undertaking of such functions did not have a significant impact on the company s operating expenses 
the increase in expenses as a percentage of cellular service revenues in compared with was due primarily to increases in costs allocated to the company by sprint for administrative support functions and an increase in phone upgrade expenses  a cost required to retain customers and effectively manage customer churn 
the company anticipates an ongoing trend of decreased general  administrative and other expenses as a percentage of cellular service revenues 
depreciation and amortization acquisitions of existing cellular communications systems generated intangible assets such as fcc license costs and goodwill which are amortized over years 
amortization expense totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company periodically assesses the ongoing value of these intangible assets and expects the carrying amounts to be fully recoverable 
depreciation expense totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
depreciation as a percentage of cellular service revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
the increases in depreciation expense primarily are the result of increased capital investment in the company s cellular network 
as a percent of cellular service revenues  depreciation continues to decline  primarily as a result of economies of scale as more customers are added to the existing network 
the company continues to invest in analog and enhanced analog network infrastructure to support customer growth and maintain the quality of its service 
the company believes that its networks have sufficient capacity to handle the company s expected customer growth rate in the near term 
in the future  the company intends to relieve any capacity constraints through frequency planning  the deployment of enhanced analog technology in additional markets  and the selective installation of additional cell sites in densely populated areas 
the company plans to implement a gradual transition to digital technology on a market by market basis as additional calling capacity is required to accommodate growth in call volume 
this approach should provide time for anticipated improvements in digital technology to be realized  while also avoiding premature capital expenditures 
in august  the company began offering code division multiple access cdma digital technology in las vegas  nevada 
the introduction of cdma in las vegas followed a six month trial that began in early the company s investment in digital technology will increase in the company believes the service lives on its existing analog technology are appropriate 
interest expense interest expense decreased in compared with because of decreases in interest rates and reduced borrowing levels as a result of the recapitalization at the time of the spinoff 
see liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding the company s recapitalization 
interest expense increased in when compared with primarily as a result of interest rate increases and increased borrowings from sprint 
prior to the spinoff  the company borrowed from sprint  primarily to fund construction costs and start up losses  at interest rates based on prime plus and a day commercial paper rate 
the average interest rate was in  in and in current borrowings consist of million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due  million of subordinated promissory notes  borrowings under a revolving credit facility credit facility with a number of banks and institutional lenders and market based short term borrowings 
minority interests in net income of consolidated entities minority interests in net income of consolidated entities represents other investors interests in the operating results of cellular systems in which the company has a controlling interest 
the increases in  and are due to improved operating results 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities represents the company s share of operating results of cellular systems in which the company does not have a controlling interest 
equity earnings increased in  and primarily as a result of increased income generated by minority cellular investments in markets that continue to mature 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  various suits arising in the normal course of business are pending against the cellular system entities in which the company does not have a controlling interest 
because the outcome of such legal proceedings has not been determined  no provision for any liability that may result upon adjudication of such litigation has been made in the consolidated financial statements of the cellular system entity or the company 
in view of the uncertainty regarding each litigation  there can be no assurance that the outcome of such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company s investment in these entities or in its equity in the net income of each entity 
income taxes the company s income tax expense for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the reduction in the company s effective tax rate in compared with  primarily was attributable to increased levels of pre tax income which lessened the impact of items not deductible for income tax purposes 
in the fourth quarter  the company recorded a million nonrecurring adjustment to its income tax provision 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding differences that caused the effective income tax rates to vary from the statutory federal income tax rates 
as of december   the company had recorded deferred income tax assets of million  net of a million valuation allowance 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the sources that gave rise to these assets 
the company has determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance  will be realized based on current income tax laws and expectations of future taxable income stemming from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or ordinary operations 
uncertainties surrounding income tax law changes  shifts in operations between state taxing jurisdictions and future operating income levels may  however  affect the ultimate realization of all or some portion of these deferred income tax assets 
net losses the company sustained net losses in each fiscal year from its formation in through these losses primarily related to the start up nature of the company s business which required significant expenditures associated with the acquisition of new customers and substantial investment in infrastructure to support growth 
total operating expenses as a percentage of cellular service revenues have declined and it is anticipated that this trend will continue as the company realizes economies of scale associated with growth in its customer base 
accordingly  the company produced net income in moreover  the company s business strategy is intended to produce ongoing long term profitability 
competition cellular carriers compete primarily against the other facilities based cellular carrier in each market 
however  companies with pcs licenses have begun to offer their products and services in several of the company s service areas 
the company has prepared for this new competitive environment by enhancing its networks  expanding its service territory  offering new features  products and services to its customers and simplifying its pricing of services 
the company believes it will benefit from its position as an incumbent in the cellular field with a high quality network  extensive geographic footprint that is not capacity constrained  strong distribution channels  superior customer service capabilities and an experienced management team 
however  there can be no assurance that these measures will completely mitigate the pressures associated with the expected increase in the level of pcs competition 
liquidity and capital resources in conjunction with the spinoff from sprint  the company repaid billion of intercompany debt to sprint 
the remaining intercompany debt  net of receivables from affiliates  was contributed to the company by sprint as additional paid in capital 
funding for the repayment was derived from the proceeds of million of senior notes issued under an indenture indenture and approximately million of initial borrowings under the credit facility 
in addition  a recapitalization of the company s common stock was effected pursuant to which the company split the shares of issued and outstanding common stock into  new shares of common stock to allow for the pro rata distribution of such stock to the common shareholders of sprint 
this distribution was effected as a tax free dividend 
the credit facility has general and financial covenants that place certain restrictions on the company 
the company is limited with respect to the making of payments dividends and distributions  the incurrence of certain liens  the sale of assets under certain circumstances  entering into or otherwise permitting any subsidiary distribution restrictions  certain transactions with affiliates  certain consolidations  mergers and transfers  and the use of loan proceeds 
in addition  the credit facility limits the aggregate amount of additional borrowings that can be incurred by the company 
the indenture has general and financial covenants similar to the credit facility 
however  these covenants  except for the limitation on liens  are suspended while the company s public debt is rated investment grade by two or more credit rating agencies 
the company attained the second such rating on february  holding company structure the company s operations are conducted largely through subsidiary corporations and partnerships 
in the case of subsidiary corporations  those entities are wholly owned  directly or indirectly  by the company and are not restricted in any way from paying dividends or other payments to the company 
in addition  the company s subsidiaries are not permitted under the credit facility  subject to certain exceptions  to restrict distributions to the company 
in the case of partnerships  to the extent funds are available for distribution  distributions are generally required under the partnership agreements  except to the extent such funds are required for additional capital investments in the partnership 
however  because the company does not control the capital structure of certain partnerships in which it holds minority interests  it is possible that such partnerships may have entered into loan agreements or other contractual arrangements that restrict or limit distributions to the partners of such partnerships 
cash flows operating activities operating cash flow increases reflect improved operating results 
during  operating cash flows were impacted by additional advertising  promotional and other marketing expenses associated with the introduction and promotion of the company s new brand name 
although future cash flows will continue to be impacted by costs associated with the promotion of the company s new brand name  the company expects cash flows generated by operating activities to continue to increase 
cash flows investing activities capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in capital expenditures in  compared with  was the result of the maturing of the company s cellular network 
in previous years  the company concentrated on satisfying the fcc s requirements for the build out of cellular systems relating to the expansion of the geographic footprint or coverage area of company held licenses  in addition to capital investment to support customer growth 
with the geographic areas of its licensed markets essentially covered  the company currently focuses on capital investment to support customer growth and on improving customer call quality 
the company plans to install cdma technology in the greater raleigh  north carolina  service area during on november   the company completed its acquisition of independent cellular network  inc and affiliated companies the icn acquisition which own and operate cellular licenses and related systems in kentucky  ohio  pennsylvania and west virginia  providing cellular service to approximately  customers in markets  representing an estimated million potential customers 
the purchase price was approximately million  comprising  shares of the company s common stock  million in aggregate principal amount of the company s subordinated promissory notes and the company s assumption of million in senior debt  which was immediately refinanced with borrowings under the credit facility 
the remaining portion of the purchase price was paid in cash 
the icn acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and its results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
assets and liabilities have been recorded at estimated fair value based on a preliminary allocation of the purchase price 
additional adjustments to these estimates are expected to be made 
to achieve cellular system compatibility and standard customer functionality  it will be necessary for the company to replace the acquired cell site equipment and switches 
such replacements commenced in and will be completed in in the first quarter of  the company acquired cellular properties in south carolina  north carolina and ohio and additional partnership interests in florida 
the aggregate purchase price of these acquisitions was million 
on a limited basis  the company has increased its ownership interests in certain of its controlled markets 
to the extent feasible  the company intends to reduce its minority investments in cellular communications systems and increase its ownership interests in controlled markets 
the company also intends to pursue the acquisition of additional markets with similar characteristics that provide opportunities to enhance the clustering of contiguous service areas 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of completed and proposed acquisitions and divestitures 
cash flows financing activities in and  cash provided by financing activities principally reflected borrowings from sprint 
following the spinoff  capital to meet funding requirements was no longer available from sprint 
in conjunction with the spinoff  the company repaid billion of intercompany debt to sprint 
the remaining intercompany debt was contributed to the company by sprint as additional paid in capital 
funding for the repayment was derived from proceeds of the company s senior notes issued under the indenture and initial borrowings under the credit facility 
in conjunction with the icn acquisition  the company issued million in aggregate principal amount of the company s subordinated promissory notes and assumed million of senior debt which was immediately refinanced under the credit facility 
the subordinated promissory notes have general and financial covenants which are currently suspended while the company s public debt is rated investment grade by two or more credit rating agencies 
the company attained the second such rating on february  as part of its cash management program  the company also incurs short term borrowings based on market interest rates to support its daily cash requirements 
the aggregate amount of these borrowings is limited to million under certain debt covenants 
in  the company repurchased shares of common stock on the open market for purposes of distributing shares under the employee stock purchase plan which terminated on june  and issuing common stock in conjunction with stock option exercises 
these purchases reduced shareowners equity by million 
liquidity prior to the icn acquisition  the credit facility was amended and restated to permit  among other things  the icn acquisition and the increase in the company s borrowing capacity from million to billion 
the aggregate amount of additional borrowings which can be incurred under the credit facility is ultimately limited by certain covenants included therein 
at december   the company had million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and was not limited in its borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
on february   a shelf registration filed with the securities and exchange commission became effective  providing for the issuance  from time to time  of up to million in aggregate initial offering price of the company s unsecured debt securities and or warrants to purchase debt securities debt securities 
the net proceeds to be received by the company from the sales of debt securities will be available for general corporate purposes and may be used for the repayment of short term debt and borrowings under the credit facility and for the funding of future acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
capital requirements substantial capital is required to expand and operate the company s existing cellular systems and to acquire interests in additional cellular systems 
the company has increased borrowings to the extent its existing cash needs have not been met through existing cash resources and cash flows from operations 
prior to the spinoff  the company met its funding requirements through borrowings from sprint 
subsequent to the spinoff  existing cash resources  internally generated funds and borrowings under the credit facility have been used to meet the company s capital requirements 
the company expects to make capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  of approximately million in funding for these expenditures is expected to be derived from existing cash resources  cash flows from operations  borrowings under the credit facility and the issuance of debt securities 
these expenditures will be made to expand and enhance existing cellular systems  install digital technology in the company s greater raleigh  north carolina  service area and replace equipment in markets acquired in the icn acquisition 
for the next several years  the company does not expect its operations to generate sufficient cash flow to meet both future capital requirements needed to fund operating activities and cash requirements for acquisitions of ownership interests in cellular communications systems 
acquisition activities may include acquisitions of new cellular communications systems or additional investments in cellular communications systems in which the company already holds an ownership interest 
the company expects that it will need to raise additional funds to make such investments 
an agreement  which was designed to preserve the tax free status of the company s spinoff from sprint  imposes certain limitations associated with equity transactions 
accordingly  the company is prohibited from issuing preferred stock and is limited as to the aggregate amount of additional common stock that it can issue  unless an unqualified opinion of counsel or ruling from the internal revenue service states that such action would not cause the spinoff to be taxable 
at december   the company was limited to issuing up to an additional million common shares 
this limitation expires on march  the company believes that it will have the needed access to the capital markets on suitable terms and that  together with borrowings under the credit facility  the issuance of debt securities and net cash provided by operations  it will have adequate capital to satisfy its projected funding requirements for operations in and thereafter 
the company currently does not intend to seek funding from other sources during see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of completed and proposed acquisitions and divestitures 
there can be no assurance that access to the capital markets can be obtained in amounts and on terms adequate to meet its objectives or that the borrowings or net cash provided by operations will be adequate to meet the company s projected funding requirements 
general hedging policies the company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage exposure to interest rate risk  but not for trading purposes 
during  the utilization of such instruments was limited to interest rate swap agreements 
the company does not take speculative positions or create an exposure in an effort to benefit from market fluctuations 
as of december   any potential loss or exposure related to interest rate swap agreements was immaterial to overall operations  financial condition and liquidity 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information related to interest rate swap agreements 
dividend policy the company currently does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future 
recent developments on march   the company issued  in aggregate principal amount of its senior notes due the net proceeds received by the company from the sale of these debt securities was used to repay a portion of the company s long term indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility 
on march   the company announced that its customer growth in the first quarter of is expected to substantially exceed its customer gain of  during the first quarter of the company expects results for the first quarter of to be adversely affected by higher customer acquisition costs resulting from such customer growth 
the first quarter customer growth is attributed to the company s new brand positioning which was launched in march  continued promotional activity  and the introduction of simplified pricing plans 
the company s new roaming rate plans  which were implemented earlier this year as part of the pricing simplification effort  are expected to reduce operating revenues by approximately million to million in the first quarter of in january  the company reported that it incurred cellular fraud losses  primarily in december  that were million higher than its historical cellular fraud level of of service revenues 
although the losses attributable to cellular fraud have declined in  such losses are expected to average approximately million per month  above historical rates  in the first quarter of forward looking statements when used in this report  the words intends  expects  plans  estimates  projects  believes  anticipates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements
