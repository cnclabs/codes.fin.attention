item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating results farmers capital bank corporation the company recorded net income of million or per share for  up from million or per share reported for the increase is primarily due to the gain on the sale of loans of the company s consumer finance subsidiary money one during the second quarter of the sale of money one loans affected consolidated results in a number of ways 
first  the pre tax gain of million increased earnings for the year 
second  the company experienced an immediate decrease in net loans of approximately million 
by year end  loan volume had grown enough to replace the loans sold and to increase net loans by approximately million over the prior year 
the impact of the gain on sale of loans can also be seen in the company s performance ratios 
return on average assets increased from to and return on average equity increased from to 
interest income total interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million  up thousand from the largest contributors to the increase were taxable and nontaxable investment securities 
interest on taxable and nontaxable investment securities was positively impacted by increases both in volume and in rate 
average taxable investment securities increased million or  while the average rate earned increased from to 
the average balance of nontaxable investment securities increased million or while the average rate earned increased from to interest on time deposits with banks  federal funds sold  and securities purchased under agreement to resell decreased thousand to million 
interest and fees on loans decreased million or 
although average loans increased million or  the average rate earned on loans decreased basis points from to 
the decline in the average rate earned on loans is partially due to the decline in higher yielding consumer loans as the consolidated loan portfolio increased in commercial loans and leases 
interest expense total interest expense increased thousand or from the increase is primarily due to increases in the volume of time deposits and the rate paid on time deposits 
interest on interest bearing demand deposits decreased thousand due to a basis point decline in the average rate paid in spite of a million  or  increase in the average balance 
interest expense for savings deposits was similar 
a decline of thousand was caused by a basis point decline in rate in spite of a increase in the average balance on savings deposits 
the average balance of time deposits increased million or and the average rate paid increased slightly from to 
the result is a million increase in interest expense on time deposits 
interest on securities sold under agreements to repurchase declined thousand due to slight declines in both volume and rate 
interest on other borrowed funds also decreased slightly  thousand  due primarily to a decline in volume as the company was able to use increasing deposits at lower rates as a cheaper source of funds 
net interest income is the most significant component of the company s earnings 
net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on assets over the interest paid for funds to support those assets

the change in the spread between rates earned and paid and net interest margin are summarized below change spread between rates earned and paid net interest margin the declines in the net interest spread and the net interest margin are partially due to a decline in higher yielding consumer loans 
as seen in the interest rate and interest differential table  slightly less interest income was earned in on a larger average loan balance when compared to the following table is an analysis of the change in net interest income analysis of changes in net interest income tax equivalent basis variance variance variance attributed to variance attributed to in thousands volume rate volume rate interest income taxable investment securities     nontaxable investment securities time deposits with banks  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell loans     total interest income     interest expense interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits time deposits     securities sold under agreements to repurchase other borrowed funds total interest expense     net interest income     percentage change  the changes which are not solely due to rate or volume are allocated on a percentage basis  using the absolute values of rate and volume variances as a basis for allocation 
income stated at fully tax equivalent basis using a tax rate 
as the table indicates  the decrease is nearly equally attributed to an increase in volume and a decrease in the net interest spread 
asset quality the provision for loan losses represents charges made to earnings to maintain an adequate allowance 
each subsidiary determines its level for the allowance and maintains it at an amount believed to be sufficient to absorb possible losses that may be experienced in the credit portfolio 
the following factors are used in establishing an appropriate allowance a careful assessment of the financial condition of individual borrowers a realistic determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral a thorough review of historical loss experience the condition of the local economy a comprehensive analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories a review of delinquent and criticized loans the provision for loan losses increased thousand compared to the company had net charge offs of million  down thousand from million in the allowance was of net loans  relatively unchanged from at the end of management feels the current reserve is adequate to cover any potential future losses within the loan portfolio 
management also continues to emphasize collection efforts and evaluation of risks within the portfolio

management implemented a self insured medical plan effective january  that has helped to control rising costs 
the commonwealth of kentucky passed new statutes revising the bank franchise tax during which will increase that expense in income tax income tax expense increased thousand  or due to the increase in earnings

the largest reductions have been in other real estate owned and restructured loans 
this trend is the result of management s continued efforts to improve the quality of the loan portfolio 
the company s loan policy includes strict guidelines for approving and monitoring loans 
the table below is a five year summary of nonperforming assets 
year ended december  in thousands loans accounted for on non accrual basis     loans contractually past due ninety days or more      restructured loans      other real estate owned   total nonperforming assets     effects of inflation the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the company differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the liquidity of the company is dependent on the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary banks see note to the financial statements 
management expects that in the aggregate  its subsidiary banks will continue to have the ability to dividend adequate funds to the company 
the company s objective as it relates to liquidity is to ensure that subsidiary banks have funds available to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability 
in order to maintain a proper level of liquidity  the banks have several sources of funds available on a daily basis which can be used for liquidity purposes 
those sources of funds are the subsidiary banks core deposits consisting of both business and non business deposits cash flow generated by repayment of loan principal and interest federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase for the longer term  the liquidity position is managed by balancing the maturity structure of the balance sheet 
this process allows for an orderly flow of funds over an extended period of time 
interest rate sensitivity since it is extremely difficult to accurately predict interest rate movements  it is management s intention to maintain the cumulative interest sensitivity gap at the one year time frame between plus or minus of total assets 
the gap position may be managed by purchasing investment securities with a maturity date within the desired time frame  offering interest rate incentives to encourage loan customers to choose the desired maturity  and offering interest rate incentives to encourage deposit customers to choose the desired maturity 
the following chart illustrates interest rate sensitivity at december  for various time periods 
the purpose of this gap chart is to measure interest rate risk utilizing the repricing intervals of the interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
rising interest rates are likely to increase net interest income in a positive gap position while falling interest rates are beneficial in a negative gap position 
the company has a negative gap position through twelve months  but then shifts to a positive gap position between one and five years 
this positioning is due to management s anticipated economic outlook and other competitive factors
