item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the primary business of wellman  inc is the manufacture and marketing of high quality polyester products  including fortrel brand polyester textile fibers  polyester fibers made from recycled raw materials and permaclear brand pet polyethylene terephthalate packaging resin 
the company currently has annual capacity to manufacture approximately billion pounds of fiber and over million pounds of resin worldwide at five major production facilities in the united states and europe 
the company expects to commence operation of an additional million pounds per year of solid stated resins production capacity in the second quarter of the company is also the world s largest plastics recycler  utilizing a significant amount of recycled raw materials in its manufacturing operations 
the fibers group produces fortrel textile fibers  which represent approximately of the company s fiber production 
these fibers are used in apparel and home furnishings and produced from two chemical raw materials  purified terephthalic acid pta and monoethylene glycol meg 
the other of fiber production  primarily fiberfill and carpet fibers  is manufactured by the recycled products group from recycled raw materials  including producer fiber  resin and film wastes and postconsumer pet soft drink bottles 
the company s pet resins  produced by the packaging products group from pta and meg  are primarily used in the manufacture of clear plastic soft drink bottles and other food and beverage packaging 
the company s markets are highly competitive 
it competes in these markets primarily on the basis of product quality  customer service  brand identity and price 
it believes it is the second largest polyester staple and third largest poy producer in the united states and the fourth largest pet resin producer in north america 
several of the company s competitors are substantially larger than the company and have substantially greater economic resources 
demand for polyester fiber historically has been cyclical  as it is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and fiber or textile product imports  all of which are driven primarily by general economic conditions 
global pet resin demand continues to grow  driven by new product applications for pet and conversion from other packaging materials to pet 
several factors significantly affect the company s profitability raw material margins  or the difference or spread between product selling prices and raw material costs  supply and demand for its products  the prices of competing materials  such as cotton and aluminum  which can affect demand for its products  and economic and market conditions in the united states  europe and other regions of the world 
prices of pta and meg  primary determinants of polyester fiber and pet resin selling prices  are cyclical 
changes in pta and meg prices are driven by worldwide supply and demand 
raw material margins for the chemical based fiber and pet resin businesses have generally been influenced by supply and demand factors 
despite growing demand for pet resin  worldwide supply is currently undergoing significant expansion which has adversely affected profitability  and is expected to continue to do so 
both fiber and resin margins experience increases or decreases due to timing of price changes and market conditions 
raw material margins for the recycled fiber operation tend to be more variable than those for the chemical based businesses  primarily because recycled raw material costs do not cause changes in fiber prices 
recycled raw material costs are primarily dependent upon worldwide supply and demand for waste materials 
the company s sales are neither materially dependent upon a single customer nor seasonal in nature 
demand  prices and raw material costs for both fibers and pet resins may be affected by global economic conditions  supply and demand balances and export activity 
by the year  the company plans to substantially increase its polyester fiber and pet resin production capacity through the expansion of existing facilities and construction of a new  state of the art production facility in mississippi 
most of the expansion will be in pet resin capacity 
as a result  the company s production mix is expected to be approximately fibers and pet resins 
results of operations compared to net sales for remained unchanged as compared to at billion 
this was generally the result of increased sales volumes and lower selling prices 
sales for the fibers group decreased to million in from million in due to significantly lower polyester fiber selling prices which more than offset improved fiber sales volume during the latter part of sales for the recycled products group rpg decreased to million from million due primarily to a week strike at the european recycled fibers operation  which kept the facility closed from mid july through early october  and the disposition of certain businesses which had sales in of million 
in addition  the decline in rpg s sales was a result of lower polyester fiber selling prices for the domestic and european recycled fibers operations 
sales for the packaging products group ppg increased to million in from million in due to higher sales volumes resulting from the december  acquisition of a netherlands based pet resins business and the mid expansion of domestic pet resins capacity 
this increased volume more than offset significantly lower worldwide pet resin selling prices 
gross profit decreased to million in versus million in the gross profit margin for was compared to for gross profit for the fibers group decreased primarily as a result of significantly lower fiber selling prices due to weak textile demand in the first half of the year which more than offset lower chemical raw material costs 
gross profit for the rpg also decreased in versus primarily due to reduced profit at the european recycled fibers operation stemming from weak business conditions compounded by the strike  and the discontinuance of gross profit from divested businesses 
this more than offset increased profits for the domestic recycled fibers business as a result of lower raw material costs 
despite higher sales volumes resulting from the aforementioned acquisition of the netherlands based pet resins business and domestic pet resins expansion  the gross profit for the ppg decreased in due to significantly lower worldwide pet resins selling prices  which more than offset lower raw material cost 
these factors contributed to a loss at the netherlands based pet resins operation 
the company s gross profit for was also negatively impacted by a million inventory charge resulting from large declines in raw material costs and selling prices  including a million charge related to the pet resins take or pay arrangement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to million in  or of sales  compared to million in  or of sales 
as a result of the foregoing  operating income decreased to million in versus million in net interest expense for increased to million from million for interest expense increased as a result of higher average outstanding borrowings which were partially offset by higher interest capitalization resulting from the company s long term capital investment program 
the effective income tax rate was in versus in this resulted from lower pretax earnings  lower earnings at its irish manufacturing operations which benefit from a favorable tax rate  and a pretax loss at the european pet resin operation which has no tax benefit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  net earnings for were million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  in outlook demand for polyester fibers and pet packaging resins is expected to improve in however  previously announced industry capacity increases are expected to exceed the higher demand 
the company anticipates increased capacity utilization rates in its polyester fiber business in  resulting from the operation of certain domestic production lines which were curtailed during due to weak demand and the end of the week labor strike at the irish fiber plant in october pet resin sales volumes are expected to increase significantly in due to the start up of a new million pounds per year production line at the darlington  sc facility in the second quarter of however  the higher sales volumes anticipated in are not expected to contribute materially to the company s net earnings 
profit margins for chemical based polyester staple fibers and pet resins deteriorated to historically low levels in  due to large declines in worldwide selling prices throughout the year which more than offset reduced raw material costs 
significant additions to pet resin and polyester staple capacity which have been announced for are expected to put further pressure on profit margins 
these conditions may result in the company s european pet resins business reporting a loss in see forward looking statements below 
results of operations compared to net sales for increased to billion from million in sales increased during for each of the company s three product groups fibers group sales increased to million from million  rpg sales increased to million from million and ppg sales increased to million from million 
sales for the fibers group increased due to higher polyester fiber selling prices which more than offset slightly lower sales volumes 
sales for the rpg increased due to higher sales at wil resulting from increased polyester fiber selling prices which more than offset slightly lower sales volumes 
ppg sales increased in due to the second quarter expansion of pet resin production capacity and  to a lesser extent  higher selling prices 
gross profit increased to million in versus million in the gross profit margin for was compared to for gross profit increased primarily due to increased gross profit at wil  primarily due to higher polyester fiber selling prices  and the aforementioned pet resin expansion 
despite the increase in gross profit  gross profit margin declined primarily because selling prices increased during the period while unit gross profit remained relatively unchanged 
selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to million in  or of sales  compared to million in  or of sales 
as a result of the foregoing  operating income increased to million in versus million in net interest expense for decreased to million from million for interest expense was favorably impacted by a decrease in average outstanding borrowings and higher interest income  which were partially offset by an increase in the average cost of variable rate borrowings 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a pretax loss of million related to the sale of a subsidiary resulting in a decrease in net earnings of million  or per share 
for additional information regarding this loss  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the effective tax rate of in versus in reflects the positive impact of strong irish earnings since the irish tax rate for manufacturing operations is significantly lower than the us federal and state tax rates and  to a lesser extent  there was also the favorable effect of strong domestic earnings which lessened the effect of nondeductible items as a relative percentage 
as a result of the foregoing  net earnings for were million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  in environmental matters the company s operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
the company takes a proactive approach in addressing the applicability of these laws and regulations as they relate to its manufacturing operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
the company has identified certain situations that will require future capital and non capital expenditures to maintain or improve compliance with current environmental laws and regulations as well as to support planned future expansion 
the majority of the identified situations are found at the company s largest manufacturing facilities and primarily deal with groundwater remediation  quality of air emissions and wastewater treatment processes 
the company s policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
while it is often difficult to reasonably quantify future environmental related expenditures  the company currently estimates its future non capital expenditures related to environmental matters to range between million and million 
in connection with these expenditures  the company has accrued management s best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures 
these amounts include approximately million accrued for preacquisition environmental contingencies relative to the acquisition discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  future capital expenditures aggregating million to million may be required related to environmental matters 
these non capital and capital expenditures are estimated to be incurred during the next to years 
the company believes that it is entitled to recover a portion of these expenditures under indemnification and escrow agreements 
during and  costs associated with environmental remediation and ongoing assessment were not significant 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the measurement of liability is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and takes into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information which becomes available 
the company believes it is either in material compliance with all currently applicable regulations or is operating in accordance with the appropriate variances and compliance schedules or similar arrangements 
actual costs to be incurred for identified situations in future periods may vary from the estimates  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures due to unknown conditions  changing government regulations and legal standards regarding liability and evolving related technologies 
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  the company believes that compliance with current laws and regulations will not require significant capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company generated cash from operations of million in compared to million in the increase in cash from operations is attributable to a net decrease in working capital items which was partially offset by a decrease in net earnings 
the working capital ratio was approximately to and to at december  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to million in compared to million in capital spending amounted to million in and million in  reflecting the company s ongoing capital investment program 
the company spent million in and million in related to an acquisition of a pet resins business in europe 
proceeds from the sale of a subsidiary amounted to million in and million in net cash used in financing activities amounted to million in versus net cash provided by financing activities of million in in  the company completed the repurchase of treasury stock totaling million 
net borrowings line of credit with bank and long term debt were million in compared to million in the company is currently engaged in a long term capital investment program to expand its polyester production capacity and estimates that capital expenditures could aggregate approximately million over the four year period from through the capital program includes a domestic pet resins capacity expansion expected to be completed in the second quarter of and construction of a new domestic polyester production facility budgeted to cost approximately million and to be operational in phases beginning in late to receive certain incentives provided by the state of mississippi  the company expects to issue rural economic development bonds 
the company believes these bonds  coupled with internally generated funds  its bank facility and other long term financing are expected to provide adequate liquidity in the future 
the company s long term capital investment program includes approximately million in planned expenditures in the exact amount and timing of the capital spending is difficult to predict since certain projects may extend into or beyond depending upon equipment delivery and construction schedules 
significant capital expenditures include the design and construction of the new production facility discussed in the preceding paragraph 
see item business products and markets and capital investment program 
the company initiated a plan during the second quarter of to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock in the open market 
at december   million shares had been repurchased at a cost of million 
the company s financing agreements contain normal financial and restrictive covenants 
the most restrictive of these covenants permits a maximum leverage ratio of  requires ebit to exceed times interest expense and the company to maintain a certain net worth 
approximately million of retained earnings at december  is not restricted as to the payment of dividends 
the company believes that it has the financial resources available to it to meet its foreseeable working capital  capital expenditure and dividend payment requirements 
the company entered into forward interest rate swaps to reduce hedge the impact of interest rate changes for variable rate borrowings associated with planned capital expenditures over the next four years 
the agreements have an aggregate notional amount of million at december   forward starting dates ranging from june to may and maturity dates of at least years thereafter 
the company will pay fixed rates of interest ranging from to 
the company estimates it would have had to pay approximately 
million at december  to terminate the agreements 
the company entered into forward foreign currency contracts to exchange dutch guilders for us dollars with an aggregate notional amount of million at december  in order to reduce the related impact of foreign currency translation adjustments 
this has the effect of converting a portion of us debt to local currency guilder debt 
the company has designated these contracts as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity 
at december   the company estimates it would receive approximately million if these contracts were terminated 
during  the company entered into forward foreign currency contracts to exchange us dollars for german marks with an aggregate notional amount of million at december  these contracts are designed to reduce hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations relative to fixed asset purchase commitments and have maturity dates ranging from march through november at december   the company would have had to pay approximately million to terminate these contracts 
the company s european businesses utilize foreign currency debt and forward currency contracts to hedge certain of their accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in other foreign currencies 
at december   the notional amount of such contracts was million and the cost to terminate these contracts was immaterial 
the company s estimates with respect to the values of its derivative instruments are based on readily available dealer quotes
