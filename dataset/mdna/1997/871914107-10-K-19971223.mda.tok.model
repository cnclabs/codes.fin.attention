overview the company s net sales in recent years have increased due to a variety of factors  including generally increasing sales volumes as a result of growing demand for the company s products and the company s ability to expand its markets through development of new products

polypropylene is the basic raw material used in the manufacture of substantially all of the company s products today  accounting for approximately of the company s cost of sales 
the company believes that the selling prices of many of its products have adjusted over time to reflect changes in polypropylene prices 
the price of polypropylene is determined by the supply and demand for the product 
historically  the creation of additional capacity has helped to relieve supply and pricing pressures although there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case 
in fiscal supply increased faster than demand  a trend that the company expects to continue into fiscal according to a september report by chemical data inc  a monthly petrochemical and plastics analysis publication  annual polypropylene capacity in north america as of december  was billion pounds per year  up from billion pounds at december  total average annual capacity is expected to rise to billion pounds per year for calendar  and to billion pounds per year by the year  a compounded growth rate

inflation and seasonality the company does not believe that its operations have been materially affected by inflation during the three most recent fiscal years

the company s sales and income have historically been higher in the third and fourth quarters of its fiscal year 
while sales and income in the carpet backing and technical textile product lines are not greatly affected by seasonal trends  sales of construction and civil engineering products are lower in the first and second quarters of any given fiscal year due to the impact of adverse weather conditions on the construction and civil engineering markets 
consequently  as sales from construction and civil engineering products continue to increase as a percentage of the company s total sales  the seasonality of these products sales will affect total sales and income of the company to a greater degree
