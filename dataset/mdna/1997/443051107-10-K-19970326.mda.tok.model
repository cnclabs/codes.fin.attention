the effect on the annual average daily oil production of the company s mineral fee properties in and was and barrels  respectively 
revenues from the sales of the labarge other products are attributable to sales of carbon dioxide  helium and sulfur 
the production level of helium was relatively stable in and  however  carbon dioxide sales volumes declined due to a lack of market 
the company was also affected by a decline in helium and carbon dioxide per unit sales prices 
sulfur sales revenues in both years were insignificant 
total revenues increased in when compared to  primarily due to the acquisition of certain properties from norcen explorer  inc  and an increase in oil prices of 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in gas prices of and a decrease in production from the main pass field as a result of being shut in for days due to hurricane opal

operating profit in  the operating profit of this segment increased million when compared to the average higher gas and oil sales prices were the largest factors in this increase in operating profit 
the increase in gas marketing revenues was offset by an increase in gas marketing costs of 
partially offsetting these improvements was an increased production cost per equivalent barrel of production from in to in this was primarily due to increased workover expense on an offshore gas supply well 
also reducing operating profit was an increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a per equivalent barrel of production from in to in an increase in general and administrative costs from million in to million in also partially offset the improvements 
the increase in operating profit in when compared to was million

these areas are texas  louisiana  mississippi and alabama 
the company has also signed an agreement to work with an exploration company to assist in prospect generation 
the company continues to evaluate the potential of developmental drilling in mississippi on acreage that it acquired in from norcen 
crude oil marketing transportation year ended december  in thousands revenues    operating profit    revenues increased in from million in to million in  and operating profit increased in from million in to million in the increase can be attributed to the company s pipeline activities 
also contributing to the increase in operating profit was a decrease in general and administrative costs of million from to the crude oil marketing activities accounted for an increase in operating profit of million offset by a decrease in operating profit for transportation activities of million 
effective december   the purchase sale and contribution conveyance of howell crude oil and howell transportation s assets and liabilities associated with crude oil gathering resulted in a pre tax gain of revenues increased in as compared to due to a increase in barrels sold per day and higher average crude oil prices 
in the company sold  barrels per day of crude oil 
in that average daily sales quantity increased to  barrels 
also increasing revenues were the crude oil pipeline transmission activities of the segment 
on march   the company acquired three crude oil pipelines from exxon 
during the nine months the company owned these pipelines  an average of  barrels per day were transported  generating revenues of million 
these revenues also include million received from exxon  representing nine months of rent under the terms of a one year lease  of the million barrels of tank space the company owned in northwest houston 
transportation activities increased revenues by million in as compared to due to a contract with lyondell petrochemical  to provide substantially all of its outbound truck transportation needs 
this contract was in effect for the latter half of and all of operating profits of the crude oil marketing and transportation segment increased from million in to million in this increase can be attributed to the company s pipeline activities 
technical fuels and chemical processing year ended december  in thousands revenues    operating profit loss   the technical fuels and chemical processing segment experienced a decrease in revenues and a decrease in operating profit when comparing to revenues from chemical sales and toll processing rose significantly in resulting from a focus on acetate and ester manufacturers for the paint and coatings industry 
revenues from sales of research and reference fuels declined million in volumes sold decreased by 
these decreases are attributable to a focus by lubricant manufacturers and laboratories on product certification rather than testing to develop and certify products to meet new standards 
development is expected to increase again in in order to prepare to meet performance standards 
the million reduction in operating profit from to was primarily due to million recognized from the cancellation of the chemical contract in referred to below 
the remaining million was due to decline in research and reference fuels offset by a significant improvement in chemicals

revenues from sales of research and reference fuels declined million in volumes sold decreased by 
also contributing to higher revenues and to the improved operating results was the revenue recognized upon the cancellation of a long term contract to process for a customer 
the revenue and operating profit recognized by this contract cancellation was million 
net interest expense interest expense in rose million over the level 
the primary reason for this increase was funds borrowed by the company in march to finance the acquisitions of three crude oil pipelines from exxon and certain oil and gas properties from norcen 
long term debt decreased from million at december  to million at december  due primarily to the repayment of the term loan and pay down of the revolving credit agreement with proceeds received from the conveyance of the company s crude operations to genesis 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  the increase in interest expense from higher average outstanding balances in was slightly offset by decreasing market interest rates 
market interest rates ranged from to throughout  while in the rates fluctuated from to 
because substantially all of the company s debt is subject to market rates  the lower rates contributed to an offset of the increase in interest expense 
the rise in rates in led to the increase in interest expense in over additionally  in the company had a higher level of average debt outstanding than in provision for income taxes in the company s effective tax rate of reflects the statutory federal rate and state income taxes less the effect of statutory depletion deductions in excess of cost basis 
as the company s pretax income increased  the effect of these deductions on the tax rate was less pronounced than in and in  these deductions contributed to an effective tax rate that was less than the statutory federal rate 
liquidity and capital resources on march   the company replaced its existing revolving credit term loan agreement and letter of credit facility with two new credit facilities  the hpc credit facility and the hco credit facility as discussed below 
the revolving credit term loan agreement was replaced with a new credit facility between howell petroleum corporation and bank one  texas  na  bank of montreal  compass bank houston and den norske bank as the hpc credit facility 
the borrowing base under the hpc credit facility was million at december  and declines monthly by million until such time as it is redetermined 
in addition  on january   the borrowing base declined an additional million 
the borrowing base is reviewed semi annually by the banks with mandatory payments if the borrowing base  as determined solely by the banks based on the company s interest in proved oil and gas reserves  is less than the outstanding balance on the loan 
the company has assumed that although the borrowing base will decrease in  the decrease would not result in a mandatory repayment under the terms of the hpc credit facility  and therefore none of the debt is reflected as a current obligation 
the hpc credit facility provides for a revolving period until september   with interest to be paid monthly at the rate selected by the company of either a floating base rate as defined in the hpc credit facility that is generally the prevailing prime rate or a rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
a libor based rate of was applicable to million of the outstanding balance under the hpc credit facility at december  the remainder of the outstanding balance of million was subject to the commitment fee rate of 
at the end of the revolving period  the revolving loan converts automatically to a four year term loan  with principal payments to be made in quarterly installments along with accrued interest on the unpaid principal balance 
the hpc credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit in an amount up to million 
the amount of letters of credit outstanding reduces the amount of the available commitment 
the hpc credit facility is collateralized by mortgages on substantially all of the company s producing oil and gas properties  the common stock of hpc  the common stock of howell crude oil company hco  which holds the genesis investment and the guarantee of the company 
there is no compensating balance requirement  and the hpc credit facility carries a commitment fee of on the available portion of the commitment 
the hpc credit facility limits the ability of the company  without the banks prior approval  to i declare or pay dividends on shares of any class of its capital stock any time a default or event of default as defined in the hpc credit facility exists or will result from such declaration or payment  ii enter into certain extraordinary corporate transactions  including a merger  consolidation  liquidation or dissolution  or iii during any month period  dispose of assets having an aggregate book value of more than five percent of the company s net worth 
material covenants and restrictions include requirements to maintain a ratio of current assets plus the available portion of the commitment to current liabilities of at least  to maintain tangible net worth  as defined in the hpc credit facility  of a floating amount that was million at december   and to prohibit certain defined types of additional indebtedness and the granting of certain liens on the company s assets without the banks approval 
based on the terms of the hpc credit facility  at december   million of the company s retained earnings was unrestricted as to the payment of common and preferred dividends 
this amount varies based on changes in the shareholders equity of the company 
the letter of credit facility was replaced with a new credit facility between howell crude oil company  bank one  texas  na  bank of montreal  compass bank houston and den norske bank as the hco credit facility 
the funds generated as a result of the purchase sale and contribution conveyance of howell crude oil and howell transportation s assets and liabilities associated with crude oil gathering were partially used to repay the hco credit facility in full during the remainder of the funds were used to pay down the hpc credit facility 
in the company issued  shares of convertible preferred stock 
the net proceeds from the sale were million 
dividends on the convertible preferred stock are to be paid quarterly 
such dividends accrue and are cumulative 
the company has paid all dividends on time 
at december   the company had negative working capital of million 
in it generated cash flow from operating activities of million 
the technical fuels and chemical processing segment is expected by the company to continue to positively impact operating cash flow 
the company also expects a positive impact in due to lower interest expense from a decrease in debt levels 
the company currently anticipates spending approximately million during fiscal years and at various of its facilities for capital and operating costs associated with ongoing environmental compliance and will continue to have expenditures in connection with environmental matters beyond fiscal year the company s channelview facility  most of which has been constructed since  was designed and engineered to comply with the more stringent current regulations 
the company has determined that the federal wastewater discharge permit at its channelview facility may have expired prior to the transfer of the permit to the company 
the company is taking steps to resolve this matter 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations and amounts available under the hpc credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy its current liquidity requirements 
at december   the company had million available to it under the hpc credit facility 
a significant decline in the value of the company s proved reserves could result in the bank reducing the borrowing base  causing mandatory payments under the hpc credit facility 
while the company does not expect this to happen in  such payments would adversely affect the company s ability to carry out its capital expenditure program 
in order to guarantee the company a specific minimum sales price for its crude oil  the company purchased a put option and sold a call option covering approximately  barrels per day of crude oil production for an month period beginning march  the option strike prices are based on the average price of crude oil on the organized exchange with monthly settlement 
the strike prices are per barrel for the put option and per barrel for the call option 
during  the monthly average sales price of crude oil on the organized exchange was between and per barrel  therefore  no options were exercised during the period 
during  the monthly average sales price of crude oil on the organized exchange was between and per barrel for january and february  therefore  no options were exercised during the two months 
the monthly average sales price for the remainder of the march  call option period  march through august  was above the ceiling 
this resulted in collar payments of million  excluding the premium amortization 
upon the expiration of the month option period  the company purchased a per barrel put option and sold a per barrel call option covering  barrels of oil per month for a six month period ending february  for september through december  the monthly average sales price exceeded the ceiling price 
this resulted in collar payments for the four month period of million 
in may the company signed a letter of intent to begin negotiations to sell hhc to schenectady 
subsequent to signing the letter of intent  negotiations between the company and schenectady were terminated 
the company continues to receive and evaluate inquiries about the sale of hhc 
in the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards nos 
and entitled accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of and accounting for stock based compensation  respectively 
statement no 
contains provisions for recording impairment of long lived assets that are not expected to produce net cash flows in the future to fully recover the remaining cost of the related assets 
the company adopted statement no 
in and did not record impairment on any of its assets 
statement no 
permits  but does not require  a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock option plans which results in compensation expense being recognized in the results of operations when stock options are granted 
the company plans to continue the use of its current intrinsic value based method of accounting for such plans where no compensation expense is recognized 
however  as required by statement  the company has provided pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as if the fair value based method of accounting had been applied
