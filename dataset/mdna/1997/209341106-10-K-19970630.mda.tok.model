general the company s sales are derived from the production and sale of customized printed materials by its operating companies 
all of the company s operating subsidiaries provide commercial printing services 
in addition  one of its houston companies also provides financial printing services 
each operating company has its own sales  estimating  customer service  prepress  production  postpress and accounting departments 
the company s headquarters  located in houston  provides centralized cash management  financial reporting and certain administrative services to all of the subsidiaries 
the company s strategy is to generate sales and profits through acquisitions and internal growth 
the company provides acquired companies cost savings through master purchasing arrangements  access to technology and capital  strategic counsel and a commitment to training through a unique  comprehensive management development program 
as a result  operating income margins and efficiencies at acquired companies  which may be lower than those of the company at the date of acquisition  typically improve as the company s operational strategies are fully implemented 
the company s consolidated financial results in a given period may be affected by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions 
the company s consolidated operating income margins in the periods immediately following a significant acquisition or series of acquisitions may be lower than historically reported consolidated margins depending upon the timing and extent to which an acquired company is able to adapt to and implement the company s management practices 
the company competes in the general commercial and financial printing sectors  which are characterized by individual orders from customers for specific printing projects rather than long term contracts  with continued engagement for successive jobs dependent upon  among other things  the customer s satisfaction with the services provided 
as such  the company is unable to predict  for more than a few weeks in advance  the number  size and profitability of printing jobs in a given period 
consequently  the timing and size of projects received in any quarter could have a significant impact on financial results in that quarter
