item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview celgene was organized in as a unit of celanese  a major chemical company 
celgene s initial mandate was to apply biotechnology to the production of fine and specialty chemicals 
following the merger of celanese with hoechst  celgene was spun out as a separate company 
in  celgene made an initial public offering of its common stock  and commenced the development of biotreatment processes for the chemical industry 
celgene discontinued these operations in to focus on the development of its targeted small molecule synthesis and biocatalytic chiral chemistry synthesis platforms 
since  the company s revenues have been generated primarily through the research and development relating to  and supply of  chirally pure intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development and  to a lesser degree  from an agrochemical research and development contract 
the company believes that sales of chirally pure intermediates will account for a less significant portion of the company s overall revenues as the company continues to develop  and  subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals  begins to generate revenues from synovir 
regtm 
and from its chirally pure pharmaceutical and agrochemical products 
the company has sustained losses in each year since its incorporation in in  the company had a net loss of million  and an accumulated deficit of million at december  the company expects to make substantial expenditures to further its immunotherapeutic program  to commercialize synovir  and to expand its chiral business  and  based on these expenditures  it is likely that losses will continue for at least months or longer  unless and until the company can achieve profitability by obtaining required regulatory approvals and achieving commercially viable sales levels of synovir 
subject to the risks described elsewhere in this annual report  the company believes that there are significant market opportunities for the products and processes under development by the company 
to address these opportunities in a timely and effective manner  the company intends to rely on collaborations and licensing arrangements with third parties 
to date  the company has entered into agreements covering the manufacture for the company of certain compounds  such as synovir  and research and development by the company covering chirally pure intermediates for use in new drug development and processes for producing chirally pure crop protection agents for license to agrochemical manufacturers 
the company intends to develop its own marketing and sales resources for commercializing its pharmaceutical products under development that address limited or geographically concentrated patient populations  and intends to enter into collaborative and licensing arrangements for commercializing those products that address large and geographically dispersed patient populations 
the company is currently developing a small marketing and sales organization for synovir 
future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for the company s products  regulatory approvals  the timing of the introduction of new products by the company or competing companies  the company s ability to control costs  and its ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific and management personnel 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and total revenues  order backlog 
the company s total revenues for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in the company s total revenues for decreased by from approximately million in the company s order backlog for chirally pure intermediates and research contracts at december  was approximately chirally pure intermediate revenues 
chirally pure intermediate revenues for increased by to approximately million from approximately  in the increase in chirally pure intermediate revenues was due primarily to the addition of new customers  and a greater volume of orders from existing customers for their ongoing clinical trials 
chirally pure intermediate revenues for decreased by from approximately million for this decrease was due primarily to the discontinuation of clinical trials by a pharmaceutical manufacturer of a product candidate that incorporated one of the company s intermediates 
research contract revenues 
research contract revenues for increased by to approximately million from  for this increase was primarily due to a greater number of research contracts 
chiral research contract revenues for increased by from approximately  for this increase was due primarily to a greater number of research contracts relating to the development of chirally pure intermediates 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold in increased by to approximately  from approximately  in this increase in cost of goods sold corresponded with the increased volume of chirally pure intermediates sold by the company 
the cost of goods sold in decreased by from approximately million in this decrease corresponds with the decrease in sales of chirally pure intermediates due primarily to the discontinuation of clinical trials by a pharmaceutical manufacturer of a product candidate that incorporated one of the company s intermediates 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this increase was due to an increase of approximately million of expenses associated with the company s immunotherapeutic program  and million of expenses associated with the initiation of the chiral pharmaceutical development program 
the major factors contributing to the increased cost of the company s immunotherapeutic and synovir programs resulted from increases in the following expense categories preclinical and clinical trial expenses  approximately million  regulatory and compliance expenses  approximately million  manufacturing costs for developmental quantities of synovir  approximately  and other ongoing research expenses  approximately million 
research and development expenses for increased by from approximately million in this increase in research and development was due to an increase of approximately million in expenses associated with the company s immunotherapeutic and synovir programs  and was partially offset by a decrease of  in personnel and related expenses for the chiral research group 
the major factors contributing to the increased cost of the company s immunotherapeutic and synovir programs resulted from increases in the following expense categories greater preclinical and clinical trial expenses  approximately million  regulatory and compliance expenses  approximately  other ongoing research expenses  approximately  and expenses associated with the rockefeller university program and other university immunotherapeutic research programs  approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this increase was primarily due to the formation of a small sales and marketing group in anticipation of the synovir product launch  the addition of product liability coverage to the company s insurance  recruiting expenses  and higher consulting and legal expenses associated with the shareholder rights agreement adopted in september selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased by from approximately million in this decrease was primarily due to a lower level of spending across most expense categories  and was partially offset by the amortization of offering costs related to the million convertible debentures sold in july  interest income and interest expense 
interest income for increased by to approximately million from approximately  in this increase was attributable to higher average cash balances in due to the million of net proceeds from the series a convertible preferred stock offering in march interest income for decreased by from approximately  in this decrease in interest income was due to the reduced funds available for investment during the first half of interest expense for decreased by to approximately  from approximately  this decrease was due to the conversion to equity of a substantial portion of the convertible debentures 
there was no interest expense in net loss 
the net loss for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this increase was due primarily to higher spending on the immunotherapeutics and synovir programs  as discussed above 
the net loss for increased by to approximately million from approximately million for this increase in net loss was due to the absence of losses from discontinued operations offset by increased spending for the synovir development program and lower sales of chirally pure intermediates 
net loss for included the loss from the company s discontinued biotreatment operations of million 
loss from continuing operations during increased approximately million due primarily to lower sales of chirally pure intermediates and higher spending on synovir 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has financed its working capital requirements primarily through private and public sales of its debt and equity securities  income earned on the investment of the proceeds from the sale of such securities  and revenues from product sales 
the company has raised approximately million in net proceeds from two public and two private offerings  including its initial public offering in july in july  the company issued and sold in a private placement offering million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due july  for total net proceeds  after offering costs  of approximately million 
as of march   approximately million principal amount of the convertible debentures had been converted into common stock  and the remaining debentures are convertible into common stock at the option of either the holder or the company 
in march  the company issued and sold in a private placement offering shares of series a convertible preferred stock at  per share  for total gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds  after offering costs  of approximately million 
see notes and to the financial statements 
the company s net working capital at december   increased by to approximately million from approximately million at december  this increase in working capital was due primarily to the million of net proceeds from the series a convertible preferred stock offering in march the company s net working capital at december  consisted principally of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents increased by  in this increase reflected the receipt of net proceeds of million from financing activities offset by million of cash used in operations  million of capital expenditures and million of investments in marketable securities 
current research commitments for  primarily for the rockefeller university  are the company expects that its rate of spending will increase as the result of increased clinical trial costs and expenses associated with the regulatory approval process and commercialization of products now in development 
in order to assure funding for the company s future operations  the company needs to seek additional capital resources 
however  no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in raising additional capital 
if the company is unable to raise additional funds  the company believes that its current financial resources could fund operations based on reduced levels of research and development and administrative activities through as of december   the company had for federal income tax purposes a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million 
if not utilized to offset future taxable income  such loss carryforward will expire between and certain events  including any sales by the company of shares of its stock and or transfers of a substantial number of shares of common stock by the current stockholders  may restrict the ability of the company to utilize its net operating loss carryforward
