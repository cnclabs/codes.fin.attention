the company derives substantially all of its revenues from the management of correctional and detention facilities for national  federal  state and local governmental agencies in the united states and abroad

revenues for operation of correctional and detention facilities are recognized as the services are provided  based on a net rate per day per inmate per diem rate or on a fixed monthly rate fixed or determined rate 
of the company s domestic facilities in operation  are compensated on a per diem basis and four are compensated at fixed monthly rates 
the per diem rates or fixed monthly rates vary according to the type of facility and the extent of services provided at the facility 
transportation revenues are based on a per mile charge or a fixed fee per trip 
the company incurs all facility operating expenses  except for certain debt service and lease payments with respect to certain facilities that the company does not own or lease

the company currently manages domestic facilities that are owned or leased by a governmental agency  construction of which as been financed by the agency through one or more of a variety of methods 
facility payroll and related taxes constitute the majority of facility operating expenses 
substantially all other operating expenses consist of food  clothing  medical services  utilities  supplies  maintenance  insurance and other general operating expenses 
as inmate populations increase following the start up of a facility  operating expenses generally decrease as a percentage of related revenues 
each facility is fully staffed at the time it is open or taken over by the company  although it may be operating at a relatively low occupancy rate at such time 
general and administrative costs consist of salaries of officers and other corporate headquarters personnel  legal  accounting and other professional fees including pooling expenses related to certain acquisitions  travel expenses  executive office rental  and promotional and marketing expenses 
the most significant component of these costs relates to the hiring and training of experienced corrections and administrative personnel necessary for the implementation and maintenance of the facility management and transportation contracts 
operating income for each facility depends upon the relationship between operating costs  the rate at which the company is compensated per manday  and the occupancy rate 
the rates of compensation are fixed by contract and approximately two thirds of all operating costs are fixed costs 
therefore  operating income will vary from period to period as occupancy rates fluctuate 
operating income will be affected adversely as the company increases the number of newly constructed or expanded facilities under management and experiences initial low occupancy rates 
after a management contract has been awarded  the company incurs facility start up costs that consist principally of initial employee training  travel and other direct expenses incurred in connection with the contract 
these costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the term of the contract plus renewals  or five years 
depending on the contract  start up costs are either fully recoverable as pass through costs or are billable to the contracting agency over the original term of the contract plus renewals 
the company has historically financed start up costs through available cash  the issuance of various securities  cash from operations and borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
newly opened facilities are staffed according to contract requirements when the company begins receiving inmates 
inmates are typically assigned to a newly opened facility on a regulated  structured basis over a one to three month period 
until expected occupancy levels are reached  operating losses may be incurred
