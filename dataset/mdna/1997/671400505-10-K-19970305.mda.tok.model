risks and uncertainties revenues from sales of communications components will account for a majority of the company s future revenues 
although demand for these products has grown in recent years with the buildout of communications networks in domestic and international markets  a decrease in the rate of infrastructure construction or upgrade programs could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the communications industry is very competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  new product development  product obsolescence and evolving product specifications 
additionally  price competition in this market is intense with significant price erosion over the life cycle of a product 
the ability of the company to compete successfully depends on the continued introduction of new products and ongoing manufacturing cost reduction

these price pressures  if not offset by cost reductions  could result in lower average gross margins

in most cases there are readily available and qualified external alternative sources of supply 
although the company does not at this time have a qualified second external source for one critical component used in the production of fiber optic modules  management believes there are other suppliers that could provide a like quality product on comparable terms 
a change in suppliers for this product could cause a delay in manufacturing and adversely impact operating results

the company s management  based upon advice of legal counsel representing the company with respect to each of these proceedings  does not believe any of these proceedings will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
the company s international operations and its results could be affected by changes in policies of foreign governments and in social and economic conditions outside the us including civil unrest  changing inflation and foreign exchange rates  and trade restrictions or prohibitions
