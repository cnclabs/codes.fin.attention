management attributes this moderate increase in sales for the period entirely to the core semiconductor distribution business which experienced excess inventory levels at the semiconductor manufacturing supplier level which resulted in reduced unit pricing and lower overall sales volume 
management believes that this situation is temporary and is now in the process of correction  however  no assurance can be given in this regard 
gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately for the year ended february  as compared to for the year ended february  management attributes this lower profit margin primarily to a general downward correction of selling prices in the marketplace  for both semiconductors and passive components  during the period and a greater volume of larger orders at lower gross profit margins
