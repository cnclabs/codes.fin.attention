printer sales decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease in printer sales was due to two major factors the introduction by hewlett packard of a competing page per minute printer  and the oce acquisition of siemens nixdorf the company s largest printer customer 
although oce formally siemens nixdorf is currently purchasing printers from kentek  total year printer volumes sold to oce declined by from fiscal to fiscal consumable supplies and spare parts sales 
consumable supplies and spare parts sales declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease was due in part to customers returning to normal inventory levels after a large build up in the last six months of fiscal in addition  lower printer sales have an immediate impact of reducing related consumable supplies and spare parts sales 
finally  older models of installed printers are being removed from service  reducing the amount of consumable supplies sales 
gross profit 
gross profit declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the gross margin increased from to in the same period 
the decrease in gross profit dollars is directly attributable to the reduction in total net sales between the two years 
the improved gross margin was primarily caused by reduced manufacturing and material costs as the company realizes the benefit of moving supplies manufacturing from japan to the united states 
furthermore  the shift of sales from printers to that of consumable supplies and spare parts  which have a higher gross margin  contributed to improved gross margin 
the continued strengthening of the dollar in relation to the japanese yen also assisted in improving the gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses

comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year total net sales 
total net sales increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal printer sales constituted and  respectively  of total net sales in fiscal and fiscal consumable supplies and spare parts sales constituted and  respectively  of total net sales in fiscal and fiscal printers 
printer sales decreased by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decreases in sales revenue and unit volumes are primarily the result of lower sales to ibm 
this was due in large part to a decision by ibm in fiscal to purchase the competition s ppm printer 
total unit sales of printers to ibm declined from units and revenue of  in fiscal to units and revenue of  in fiscal this reduction in printer revenue was partially offset by increased unit sales of the kd printer 
oem printer revenue totaled  in fiscal  increasing to  in fiscal consumable supplies and spare parts sales 
consumable supplies and spare parts sales increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the company s consumable supplies sales for higher speed printers  which use more consumable supplies  more than offset the decline in spare parts sales to ibm caused by their reduced printer purchases 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal the gross margin increased from to in the same period 
the increase in dollars and as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the significant increase in sales of the higher margin kd printer as well as reduced manufacturing and material costs as the company completed the movement of supplies manufacturing from japan to the united states 
this increase was attributable to a lesser extent to an increase in higher margin supplies sales and to an increase in consumable supplies sales as a percentage of total net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this increase was due primarily to increases in salary and profit sharing payout 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase was due to the expenses associated with the continued development of the kw product line 
interest expense and other income expense 
interest expense and other income expense decreased from  of expense in fiscal to  of income in fiscal net interest expense at june  was  while at june  net interest income of  was realized as a result of greater cash available for investment  as well as reduction of debt obligations 
other income expense decreased primarily due to all customers who previously paid in yen now paying in us dollars during this period  which results in no foreign exchange gain 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for fiscal was  or an effective tax rate of  as a result of the utilization of available net operating loss carryforwards which offset taxable income 
income tax expense for fiscal was  or an effective rate of  due to recognition of a deferred tax asset of  in the period 
a reconciliation of the income tax rates to the federal statutory rate is presented in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
as of june   the company has utilized all of its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
therefore  management anticipates that its future net income will be less than its historical net income because of its future effective tax rate will approximate compared to an effective tax rate of and in fiscal and  respectively 
the following table summarizes the adjusted pro forma effect to net income per common share assuming the company had an effective tax rate of for fiscal and and assuming the payment of the excess liquidation preference elp 
elp was a one time dividend paid to holders of senior convertible preferred stock scps during the company s ipo 
fiscal year ended june  in thousands  except per share data income before tax   elp   income tax expense   adjusted net income applicable to common stockholders   adjusted net income per common share international sales direct sales to customers not located in the united states represented  and of the company s total net sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
substantially all of the sales made by the company in international markets are priced in dollars to eliminate currency risk 
the company s international sales are concentrated in europe  and for the year ended june   and  respectively  of such sales were to customers located in germany and the netherlands 
the company believes that its recent decline in international printer sales is primarily attributable to a change in practice by certain oem customers to purchase more products in the united states for resale abroad 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations historically through internally generated cash  investing  subordinated debt and equity financing  and bank borrowings 
in november  the company sold its manufacturing facility in tama  japan 
the proceeds from the sale were used to pay off the company s short term debt and the remaining mortgage on the property 
changes in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal resulted in a net decrease of  as compared to an increase of  during fiscal the primary reasons for this decrease were the purchases of marketable securities of  as well as the payoff of the long term debt associated with the sale of the japan property 
the increase of  in cash provided by operations was a result of a significant decrease in inventory and others assets partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
on april   the company completed an initial public offering ipo 
the company received net proceeds from the sale of its common stock of  after deducting underwriting discounts and commission  offering expenses totaling  and from the net proceeds the company paid the elp of  on the company s scps 
changes in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal resulted in a net increase of  as compared to an increase during fiscal of  the primary factors for this increase were the net proceeds of  offset by the payment of elp of  from the company s ipo in april  as well as  less cash being used in financing activities to reduce debt obligations in fiscal and a reduction in equipment purchases of  offset in part by a  decrease in net cash provided by operations 
the primary factor for the decrease in cash provided by operations was an increase in inventory 
this factor was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable due to lower sales volume and the reduced cost of manufacturing in the us as compared with japan 
the company has a  unsecured line of credit with a bank which expires in october as of june   the company had no outstanding balance under this loan 
the company does not actively draw on this line of credit  and does not anticipate drawing on this line over the next several months 
at june  the company had recorded a  net deferred tax asset 
the company had determined that it is more likely than not that it will have sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the corresponding tax benefit resulting from the deferred tax asset 
this determination is based on several recurring periods of profitable operations  continuing efforts to enhance and develop existing and new customer relationships  the company s movement of a substantial portion of its supplies manufacturing to the united states from japan and the strengthening of the dollar against the yen 
management plans to reevaluate the positive and negative evidence to this effect on a quarterly basis and make appropriate adjustments to the deferred tax asset 
as of june   the net deferred tax asset totaled  with  classified as non current as a result of the nature of these temporary differences 
the non current portion is attributable to property and equipment 
financial information about income taxes is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements which appear elsewhere in this form k 
the company believes that funds from operations  together with its bank line  will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for at least twelve months from the date of this form k 
the company pays an annual cash dividend to holders of its common stock equal to 
per share  payable quarterly 
foreign currency exchange the company has sizable operations in japan  and as a result  operating expenses and production costs are dependent on dollar yen exchange rates 
as the yen strengthens in relation to the dollar  kentek s manufacturing costs and operating expenses in japan increase  thereby adversely affecting results of operations 
kentek has a currency risk sharing arrangement with its major customers which mitigates  but does not eliminate  currency risk 
the company has taken steps to reduce this exposure by relocating approximately one half of its manufacturing operations to the us and plans to manufacture its kw printers and consumable supplies in the united states 
in addition  certain of the company s contracts with its customers contain pricing schedules that are designed to share any financial benefit or burden arising from fluctuations in the yen equally between kentek and the customer 
currently  these schedules apply primarily to printers and spare parts  whereas most supplies are sold at fixed prices 
in addition  the company from time to time purchases forward contracts to hedge its currency exposure 
as of june  the company had no outstanding forward contracts
