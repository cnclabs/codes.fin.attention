this compares to net income of million  or per share  for fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
historical results and percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of operating results for any future period

the following table sets forth net revenues by product category and the percentage relationship to total net revenues 
the enterprise graphics category includes micrografx flowcharter r  micrografx graphics suite tm  small business graphics and print studio r  micrografx designer tm  designer power pack  abc toolkit tm and abc snapgraphics tm 
the web graphics category includes webtricity tm  simply d tm  picture publisher r  photomagic r  instant d tm and visual reality r 
the personal creativity category includes american greetings r creatacard r plus tm  american greetings r creatacard r gold tm  crayola tm amazing art adventure tm  crayola tm art studio tm  crayola tm art studio tm  crayola tm art tm  and hallmark connections tm card studio tm 
revenues from windows draw r are categorized as either enterprise graphics or personal creativity depending on the company s assessment of the market or channel into which the product is sold 
optima tm was acquired on june  through the acquisition of advanedge and therefore did not contribute revenue in either year 
years ended june  enterprise graphics   web graphics   personal creativity   total revenues   enterprise graphics the twelve percent decline in enterprise graphics revenues resulted from the decline in sales relating to products that the company no longer actively markets which was not fully offset by growth in the sales of products which the company continues to actively market 
the lack of growth in sales of products the company actively markets was primarily a result of a delayed product release cycle in fiscal due to the rapid change in technology related to personal computers and software  the majority of sales for a version of a software product occur within the first year of its release 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company decided to shift the release of its enterprise graphics software to the third quarter of fiscal  after the close of the christmas season 
while the company did release new versions of flowcharter and graphics suite during the third quarter of fiscal  the delay in introducing these products meant that older titles such as designer power pack had lost their prior year sales momentum 
the decline in revenue is also attributable to the delay in corporations adopting windows and windows nt  the operating systems for which the company s principal business products are designed 
the company s future business graphics revenues are expected to continue to be substantially dependent upon sales of micrografx graphics suite and flowcharter as companies migrate to windows and windows nt software applications 
during the year  revenues from the micrografx graphics suite and the standalone versions of micrografx flowcharter combined represented more than two thirds of the company s enterprise graphics revenues 
additionally  the company released the small business graphics and print studio in the first quarter and revenues for windows draw sold through international corporate channels almost doubled compared to the prior year 
in this category  the company is continuing to focus on increasing its corporate license sales 
web graphics the thirty three percent decline in web graphics resulted from the same factors that caused the decline in enterprise graphics  partially offset by the introduction of a new product 
web graphics and enterprise graphics products have the same development and release cycle  thus webtricity  simply d  and picture publisher were released in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal while initial sales of these products were strong  it was not sufficient to offset the decline in revenues related to older products such as instant d  visual reality  and photomagic 
the change in the product release cycle also resulted in lower revenues for simply d and picture publisher in versus in this category  the company is working with oem original equipment manufacturer customers and has recently announced alliances with companies such as stb systems and matrox graphics to bundle certain of these products with graphics accelerator boards they produce 
personal creativity the revenue growth in the company s personal creativity products resulted from the release of two new greeting card products partially offset by the discontinuance of two products 
the company introduced american greetings r creatacard r plus tm and american greetings r creatacard r gold tm in the first and third fiscal quarters  respectively  while the company s agreements to market the hallmark and crayola products expired in the first and third quarters  respectively 
revenues from the creatacard products exceeded prior year sales of the company s hallmark product despite lower prices and the introduction and intense competition from microsoft s hallmark greetings workshop 
fiscal revenues for windows draw remained constant with the prior year 
for the year  the creatacard products represented more than half of the company s consumer product revenues 
the company plans to release new versions of windows draw and the creatacard products in time for the christmas selling season 
in this category  the company also bundles products with those of oems

net revenues by geographic region and as a percentage of total revenues are as follows years ended june  americas   europe   pacific rim   total net revenues   revenue declines were across all geographic regions and resulted from the change in the product release schedule as discussed earlier and the lack of localized versions of personal creativity products 
the effect of delaying the release schedule approximately two quarters had a more severe impact on international locations because of the effort required to localize the product 
localization consists of modifying and translating the software as well as the box and its contents to a suitable product for another market such as germany  france  or japan 
this additional work usually results in an international version of a product being released the quarter following the product s english release 
cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues includes the cost of documentation  diskettes or compact disks cds  packaging and production overhead for the company s application software products  amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired product rights  and external product royalties 
cost of revenues in fiscal were million  or of net revenues  compared to million or of net revenues in fiscal the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal is attributable to lower selling prices on the company s greeting card software products  increased amortization of acquired product rights  and increased external royalties 
also contributing to the rise in cost of revenues as a percent of revenues was an unfavorable shift in product mix to boxed products which contain typical content packaging  manuals  cds or floppy disks from oem and license revenues which require substantially less content 
the company s objective is to return the product mix to a more historically normal relationship between boxed products and oem and license products 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expenses include the cost of advertising  promotions  co op  rebate and incentive programs with distributors  trade shows  marketing  technical support  and the company s sales force 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars reflects the efficiencies gained by eliminating duplicate costs subsequent to the acquisition of visual  the recent reduction in executive overhead and management layers  and cost control measures 
the rise in sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenue was due primarily to the increased promotional costs related to selling product through retail channels in conjunction with the rise of personal creativity revenues 
the effect of the retail promotions coupled with an overall retail slowdown during the fiscal fourth quarter resulted in lower revenues with relatively higher costs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses include the costs of the company s information systems  human resources  finance and administrative functions 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal research and development expense research and development expenses include compensation  benefits  and incentives paid to developers 
in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  the company capitalizes certain software development costs incurred after technological feasibility is achieved 
these costs are amortized over the estimated economic life of the products  generally to months 
amortization of capitalized software development costs is included in cost of revenues 
research and development expenses net of amounts capitalized in fiscal were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal gross research and development expenses  before capitalization  for fiscal were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of revenues for fiscal during fiscal  the company capitalized approximately million in software development costs and amortized million in software development costs 
this compares to capitalization of million and amortization of million for fiscal in process research and development charge on june   the company acquired advanedge technologies  inc for approximately million 
the purchase price consisted of million in cash paid on june   million to be paid in cash or company stock over the subsequent months  and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the acquisition was effected by a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company into advanedge technologies  inc a substantial portion of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development based on an independent valuation study as technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative commercial use had been identified 
the purchase price allocated to in process research and development resulted in a million charge to expense  with no related tax benefit in fiscal the technology acquired will be utilized in future products 
the company allocated the total purchase price as follows in thousands tangible and intangible assets  purchased in process research and  development goodwill total  restructuring charges effective december   j 
paul grayson resigned as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the company 
an evaluation of the company s organization and operations resulted in the decision to make certain organization changes 
these changes resulted in a charge of million for the termination of seven members of management 
the company also recorded a million charge related to the termination of commitments made by the previous management for which no future benefit will be received 
as of june   the company has paid approximately million in termination benefits under this restructuring 
approximately million of this charge remains classified as an accrued liability as of june  the company expects that the remaining liability will be paid out over the next six months 
acquisition charges in fiscal  micrografx acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock and options of visual software  inc visual  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
as a result of this acquisition  the company incurred charges for professional services  the write off of costs related to certain software products which were no longer actively marketed  exit costs  and costs to eliminate excess personnel and duplicate leases of approximately  of which  was non cash 
components of the acquisition related charges consisted of the following in thousands acquisition transaction costs  asset write downs inventory and accounts receivable acquired product rights fixed assets severance and other  total acquisition charges  the severance charges resulted from the closing of visual s general and administrative support office and the related termination of visual employees 
none of this charge remains as an accrued liability as of june effect of exchange rates exchange rates during fiscal had an unfavorable impact on net revenues reported by the company 
if exchange rates had not changed from their rates  the company would have reported approximately million more in net revenues in fiscal this decrease resulted from the change in exchange rates of european currencies and the japanese yen versus the us dollar 
since european manufacturing costs and european and japanese operating expenses are also incurred in those local currencies  the relative translation impact of exchange rates on net income loss is less than on revenues 
the company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge against certain exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure results from the company s foreign operations in countries including germany  france  the united kingdom  the netherlands  and japan that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
see foreign forward exchange contracts under summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements 
nonoperating income expense non operating income expense includes interest income  interest expense and other income expense 
other income expense  net includes the gain or loss resulting from revaluation of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currency  and gains or losses when receivables and payables denominated in foreign currency are settled 
interest income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  while unfavorable exchange rate variations charged million to other expense in fiscal and million in income taxes the company recognized a tax benefit of million in fiscal  compared to a tax provision of million in fiscal for further information on income taxes  see notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal on april   the company acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock and options of visual software  inc visual for approximately  shares of micrografx common stock 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  the financial information of micrografx prior to june  has been restated to retroactively include the accounts and operations of visual 
net revenues years ended june  enterprise graphics   web graphics   personal creativity   total revenues   enterprise graphics and web graphics the combined revenues from the company s enterprise graphics and web graphics products declined from fiscal to fiscal despite the successful introduction of micrografx graphics suite  which made up more than of the company s enterprise graphics revenues 
during the company s fiscal  microsoft introduced windows and windows nt which changed the standard computer operating systems from a bit architecture to bit 
the effect of the changing standard resulted in the need to re write software programs to run efficiently on this new operating system 
the company focused its efforts on re writing its software to stay on the forefront of technology instead of updating its products for the predecessor windows as a result  the products introduced by the company were well suited for the new operating systems but customers continued buying products made for windows the decline in revenue reflects the delay of customers adopting windows and windows nt 
personal creativity the revenue growth in the company s consumer products was primarily attributable to the release of the initial version of the hallmark connections tm card studio tm in august during the year ended june   revenue from the hallmark connections tm card studio tm represented more than half of the company s personal creativity revenues 
in addition  revenue from windows draw and the products licensed under the crayola brand name increased year over year 
see licensing agreements under trends and risk factors for further discussion of hallmark connections tm card studio tm and the crayola brand name products 
net revenues by geographic region and as a percentage of total revenues are as follows years ended june  americas   europe   asia pacific   total net revenues   the growth of net revenues during the year was greatest in japan and the united states  which grew and  respectively  over fiscal revenues in the united states were positively impacted by the release of micrografx graphics suite and the company s personal creativity offerings 
revenue declined slightly in europe due to general economic conditions  slower transition to windows and windows nt  and that the company s consumer products are not distributed in europe 
cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues in fiscal were million  or of net revenues  compared to million or of net revenues in fiscal the improvement in cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal is attributable to a product mix that includes more oem products bundled by original equipment manufacturers and license revenues  which have lower cost of revenues than full product versions 
this improvement was offset in part by increased external royalties associated with certain of the company s consumer products 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expenses in fiscal were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue reflects the efficiencies gained by marketing fewer products as a result of their combination into suite offerings 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflects efficiencies realized by leveraging the company s organization over a larger revenue base 
research and development expense research and development expenses net of amounts capitalized in fiscal were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal  an increase of million 
gross research and development expenses  before capitalization  for fiscal were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of revenues for fiscal the increase in gross spending is due to increased investment across all product lines

quarters ended previously reported net revenues     gross profit     income loss from operations    net income loss   income loss per share shares used in computing income loss per share     trends and risk factors the following discusses trends and risk factors inherent in the company s business environment 
new product introductions the company s future financial performance will depend in significant part upon the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced versions of its products and customer acceptance of these products  of which there can be no assurance 
additionally  the timing of new product introductions which are updates of previously released products can have a significant impact on profitability of the older version of the product 
to the extent that the distributors were unable to sell the older version at the rate they anticipated when they purchased the product  additional marketing expenditures are generally required to promote the older version in order to reduce stocking levels in anticipation of the release of the new version of the product 
licensing agreements the company s business strategy includes entering into licensing agreements with third parties in an effort to increase brand awareness for the company s products by associating the micrografx name with products and services which customers already know 
the company has entered into a licensing agreement with american greetings corporation relating to american greetings creatacard plus and the american greetings creatacard gold products 
the agreement expires on august   and automatically renews for successive terms of one year each  unless terminated by either party prior to the expiration of the initial term 
the company s product offering in fiscal included hallmark connections card studio  pursuant to a license agreement between the company and hallmark cards  inc this product represented million or of fiscal revenues 
the license expired in september the company s product offering in fiscal included crayola art and crayola art studio  pursuant to a license agreement between the company and binney smith properties  inc  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  inc 
together these products accounted for million or of fiscal revenues 
this license agreement expired on december   at which time the company discontinued production of these products  except that it was contractually allowed to sell off existing inventories through march  technological change the personal computer industry is subject to rapid technological change and continuing development of new and enhanced operating environments 
the success of the company s products will depend to a large extent upon the company s ability to continue to develop and introduce innovative and competitive products on a cost effective and timely basis  of which there can be no assurance 
competition the personal computer applications software market is highly competitive 
the company s competitors include many companies who have larger technical staffs  more established and larger marketing and sales organizations and significantly greater financial resources than does the company 
additionally  merger activity in the applications software market serves to strengthen the merging companies ability to compete 
international operations the company anticipates that international net revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of net revenues  which will result in a significant portion of the company s net revenues being subject to the risks inherent in international operations 
these risks include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
changes in distribution channels the retail distribution channel for software products is currently undergoing significant changes  with the expansion of software products into mass merchandisers and computer superstores 
additionally  the company distributes its consumer products through channels not typically associated with software products  including mass merchandisers and toy stores 
the company s success depends in part on the ability to identify and respond to changes in the distribution channel 
seasonality the company s results of operations are subject to significant quarterly variations 
causes of these variations include seasonality of the retail software market  delays in the introduction of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  timing and cost of new product upgrades and introductions  reduced distribution channel sales preceding the introduction of updated products  and large distribution channel sales following the introduction of new or updated products 
historically  as is typical in the retail software industry  the company has experienced some seasonal variations in demand  with sales declining somewhat in the summer months and increasing somewhat during the christmas quarter and first calendar quarter 
upgrades product upgrades  which enable users to upgrade from earlier versions of the company s products  or from competitors products  typically have lower prices than new products  resulting in lower gross profit margins 
the company plans to continue upgrading successful products in the future 
internet the company provides products for use in the internet market 
the internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants 
as is typical in the case of a new and evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet including security  reliability  cost  ease of use and access  and quality of service remain unresolved and may impact the growth of internet use  together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such markets 
gross profit product margins vary according to product mix and the geographical region in which the products are sold 
changes in product mix  including the mix of boxed product full and upgrade product versions relative to the amount of non boxed product oem and corporate licenses  the mix of enterprise and web graphics products to personal creativity products which carry lower margins  the transition to suite products accompanied with value pricing  as well as changes in the components of direct costs  have in the past and may in the future negatively affect the company s gross profit 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
cash flows during fiscal for the year ended june   cash used in investing activities exceeded cash provided by operating and financing activities  resulting in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash flows from operating activities generated million in cash during fiscal the net loss and resulting increase in deferred tax assets was more than offset by the adjustments due to depreciation  the in process research and development charge  and an increase in accounts payable 
accounts receivable allowances increased primarily due to increases of million in accrued rebates and incentives and million in co op funds 
these increases reflect the companies strategic decision to increase the use of distributor rebates 
cash flows from investing activities used million during fiscal and consisted primarily of additions to capitalized software development costs and acquired product rights and purchases of property and equipment 
expenditures for property and equipment during fiscal were million and consisted primarily of computer and equipment upgrades 
investments of million were also made in capitalized software development costs and acquired product rights related to the development of new and enhanced versions of the company s products 
cash flows from financing activities provided million in cash during fiscal  due primarily to proceeds received from employee stock programs 
as discussed in the footnotes to the financial statements  approximately million of the million restructuring charge remains classified as an accrued liability as of june  the company expects to pay this amount during the next six months 
capital resources as of june   the company had no significant commitments for capital expenditures 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and existing cash will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements in the short term 
the company believes that thereafter its liquidity requirements could be met with cash flow from operations  and existing cash and short term investment balances 
other matters the assets and liabilities of non us operations are translated into non us dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the respective balance sheet dates  and revenue and expense accounts of these operations are translated at average exchange rates during the month the transactions occurred 
unrealized translation gains and losses are included as an adjustment to shareholders equity 
the company has mitigated a portion of its currency exposure through decentralized sales  marketing and administrative operations 
when necessary  the company may also hedge to prevent material exposure 
litigation the company is party to various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities  none of which  in management s opinion  is expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 earnings per share  sfas which will become effective december  early adoption of the standard is not permitted 
upon adoption in the second quarter of fiscal  the company will be required to change the method currently used to compute earnings per share and to restate all prior periods 
under the new requirements  the dilutive effect of stock options will be excluded from primary earnings per share calculation 
adoption of sfas will not materially impact either primary or fully diluted earnings loss per share for the years ended june    and because the dilutive effect of stock options was not significant 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  reporting comprehensive income and sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
both standards become effective in early adoption of sfas is permitted  and early adoption of sfas is encouraged 
the effects of both of these standards on the company are currently being determined 
forward looking statements the company notes that  with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed above are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  without limitation  changes in the market  new products and announcements from other companies  changes in technology  and competition from larger  more established competitors as discussed in the trends and risk factors of this item
