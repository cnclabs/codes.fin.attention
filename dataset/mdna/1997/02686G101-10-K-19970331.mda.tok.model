until the change in the partnership s investment policy  as discussed below  the partnership was in the business of originating mortgage loans originated insured mortgages and acquiring mortgage loans acquired insured mortgages  and together with originated insured mortgages  referred to herein as insured mortgages 
as of december   the partnership had invested in either originated insured mortgages which are insured or guaranteed  in whole or in part  by the federal housing administration fha or acquired insured mortgages which are fully insured as more fully described below 
the partnership s reinvestment period expired on december   and the partnership agreement states that the partnership will terminate on december   unless previously terminated under the provisions of the partnership agreement 
the partnership s principal investment objectives are to invest in insured mortgages which i preserve and protect the partnership s invested capital  ii provide quarterly distributions of adjusted cash from operations which may be increased over time as a result of participations as defined below  when obtainable  on originated insured mortgages  and iii provide appreciation by selecting acquired insured mortgages which present the possibility of early prepayment 
as of december   the partnership had invested in insured mortgages with aggregate amortized cost  face and fair values of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued investment in insured mortgages the partnership s investment in insured mortgages is comprised of participation certificates evidencing a undivided beneficial interest in government insured multifamily mortgages issued or sold pursuant to fha programs fha insured certificates  mortgage backed securities guaranteed by gnma gnma mortgage backed securities and fha insured mortgage loans fha insured loans 
the mortgages underlying the fha insured certificates  the gnma mortgage backed securities and the fha insured loans are non recourse first liens on multifamily residential developments or retirement homes 
payments of principal and interest on fha insured certificates and fha insured loans are insured by the united states department of housing and urban development hud pursuant to title of the national housing act 
payments of principal and interest on gnma mortgage backed securities are guaranteed by gnma pursuant to title of the national housing act 
the following is a discussion of the partnership s mortgage investments  along with the risks related to each type of investment 
a 
fully insured fha insured certificates and gnma mortgage backed securities listed below is the partnership s aggregate investment in fully insured acquired insured mortgages as of december  and december  number of gnma mortgage backed securities fha insured certificates amortized cost   face value   fair value   during  the partnership purchased three acquired insured mortgages totalling approximately million  as discussed below 
listed below is the partnership s aggregate investment in fully insured originated insured mortgages as of december  and december  number of mortgages amortized cost   face value   fair value   as of february   all fully insured mortgages were current with respect to the payment of principal and interest 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in february  the general partner instructed the servicer for the mortgage on water s edge of new jersey  a fully insured acquired construction loan  to file a notice of default and an election to assign the mortgage with the department of housing and urban development hud 
the property underlying this construction loan is a nursing home located in trenton  new jersey 
as of december   the partnership had received approximately million from the assignment including repayment of accrued interest 
the remainder of the proceeds  approximately million  is included in due from hud and receivables and other assets 
in january  the partnership received additional gross proceeds of approximately million from hud 
these proceeds of per unit were declared as part of the january distribution and will be distributed in may hud has disallowed approximately million of the assignment claim 
the servicer is currently negotiating with hud in regard to collection of the disallowed portion of the claim 
the general partner believes the full amount of the receivable will be recovered from either hud or the servicer 
in conjunction with the assignment of the mortgage  the partnership recognized a net loss of approximately  in the second quarter of during march  a retained yield holder in the harbor view estates loan exercised its right to purchase the participation certificate with respect to this insured mortgage after a notice of default was filed with hud 
in march  the partnership received approximately  in disposition proceeds  including approximately  of interest due to the partnership from this prepayment 
the net principal proceeds were approximately  resulting in a gain of approximately the net proceeds were reinvested in fully insured mortgages 
in april  approximately  was remitted to the retained yield holder in the harbor view estates mortgage in connection with the final accounting of this disposition 
this resulted in a net loss of approximately  which is included on the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended december  in june  the partnership entered into a modification agreement with the mortgagor of turn at gresham 
this agreement effectively lowered the interest rate on the mortgage from to for a period until maturity 
in addition  a seven year prepayment lockout was included in the modification  followed by a   and penalty in years eight  nine  and ten  respectively 
the partnership incurred a loss of approximately  in connection with this modification which represents the write off of unamortized costs 
in the case of fully insured originated insured mortgages and acquired insured mortgages  the partnership s maximum exposure for purposes of determining loan losses would generally be approximately of the unpaid principal balance of the insured mortgage an assignment fee charged by fha at the date of a default  plus the unamortized balance of acquisition fees and closing costs paid in connection with the acquisition of the insured mortgages and the loss of approximately days accrued interest 
b 
coinsured fha insured certificates under the hud coinsurance program  both hud and the coinsurance lender are responsible for paying a portion of the insurance benefits if a mortgagor defaults and the sale of the development collateralizing the mortgage produces insufficient net proceeds to repay the mortgage obligation 
in such cases  the coinsurance lender will be liable to the partnership for the first part of such loss in an amount up to of the part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued outstanding principal balance of the mortgage as of the date foreclosure proceedings are instituted or the deed is acquired in lieu of foreclosure 
for any loss greater than of the outstanding principal balance  the responsibility for paying the insurance benefits will be borne on a pro rata basis  by hud and by the coinsurance lender 
while the partnership is due payment of all amounts owed under the mortgage  the coinsurance lender is responsible for the timely payment of principal and interest to the partnership 
the coinsurance lender is prohibited from entering into any workout arrangement with the borrower without the partnership s consent and must file a claim for coinsurance benefits with hud  upon default  if the partnership so directs 
as an ongoing hud approved coinsurance lender  and under the terms of the participation documents  the coinsurance lender is required to satisfy certain minimum net worth requirements as set forth by hud 
however  it is possible that the coinsurance lender s potential liability for loss on these developments  and others  could exceed its hud required minimum net worth 
in such case  the partnership would bear the risk of loss if the coinsurance lenders were unable to meet their coinsurance obligations 
in addition  hud s obligation for the payment of its share of the loss could be diminished under certain conditions  such as the lender not adequately pursuing regulatory violations of the borrower or the failure to comply with other terms of the mortgage 
however  the general partner is not aware of any conditions or actions that would result in hud diminishing its insurance coverage 
as of december  and  the partnership held investments in three coinsured fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages 
one of these coinsured mortgage investments  the mortgage on st 
charles place phase ii  is coinsured by the patrician mortgage company patrician  an unaffiliated third party coinsurance lender under the hud coinsurance program

the general partner intends to continue to oversee the partnership s interest in this mortgage investment to ensure that patrician meets its coinsurance obligations 
the general partner s assessment of the realizability of the carrying value of the st 
charles place phase ii mortgage is based on the most recent information available  and to the extent these conditions change or additional information becomes available  the general partner s assessment may change 
however  the general partner does not believe that there would be a material adverse impact on the partnership s financial condition or its results of operations should patrician be unable to comply with its full coinsurance obligation 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued coinsured by affiliate as of december  and  the partnership held investments in two fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages  where the coinsurance lender is ifi

all of the fha insured loans contain participations 
during the years ended december   and  the partnership received additional interest of   and  respectively  from the fha insured loans which contain participations 
these amounts are included in mortgage investment income on the accompanying statements of operations 
results of operations versus net earnings decreased for as compared to primarily as a result of a reduction in net gains on mortgage dispositions and modifications  as discussed below 
also contributing to this decrease were decreases in mortgage investment income and interest and other income  as discussed below 
mortgage investment income decreased for as compared to this decrease was primarily due to the timing of the reinvestment of net proceeds from the may assignment of the water s edge of new jersey mortgage 
additionally  the participation agreement with the breakers at golf mill was terminated effective march   therefore participations received by the partnership decreased from  in to  in interest and other income decreased for as compared to this decrease was primarily due to interest earned on claim proceeds from hazeltine shores and pinewood park apartments during also contributing to this decrease was a decrease in short term investment income 
general and administrative expenses decreased for as compared to this decrease was primarily the result of non recurring professional fees in connection with the disposition of problem mortgages in  as well as a decrease in service fee expense as a result of the reduction in the mortgage base 
net gains on mortgage dispositions and modifications decreased for as compared to gains or losses on mortgage dispositions and modifications are based on the number  carrying amounts and proceeds of mortgage investments disposed of during the period 
during  the partnership incurred net losses on mortgage dispositions and modifications part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of approximately  related to the prepayment of the mortgage on harbor view estates  the partial settlement of the coinsurance claim on water s edge of new jersey and the modification of the mortgage on turn at gresham

part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources the partnership s operating cash receipts  derived from payments of principal and interest on insured mortgages  plus cash receipts from interest on short term investments  were sufficient during to meet operating requirements 
the basis for paying distributions to unitholders is cash flow from operations  which includes regular interest income and principal from insured mortgages  and gains  if any  from mortgage dispositions 
although the insured mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each quarter due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market where the monthly mortgage payments received are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base and monthly mortgage payments due to monthly mortgage payments received or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages and professional fees and foreclosure and acquisition costs incurred in connection with those insured mortgages and variations in the partnership s operating expenses

net cash provided by investing activities decreased for as compared to primarily due to an increase in the acquisition of acquired insured mortgages from approximately million in to approximately million in this decrease was also due to a reduction in proceeds from mortgage dispositions and modifications from approximately million in to approximately million in net cash used in financing activities decreased for as compared to primarily due to a decrease in distributions paid to partners as a result of special distributions related to the receipt of previously undistributed accrued interest and capital gain in connection with the disposition of the mortgages on hazeltine shores  pinewood park apartments and hamlet at cobb s landing during the first three quarters of cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities increased for as compared to primarily due to an increase in receivables and other assets during as a result of the disposition of the properties underlying the coinsured mortgages on pinewood park apartments  hazeltine shores and hamlet at cobb s landing  as discussed above 
also contributing to the increase was a decrease in payments made and treated as an addition to ahfs and due from hud during  as compared to  as well as a decrease in general and administrative costs  as previously discussed
