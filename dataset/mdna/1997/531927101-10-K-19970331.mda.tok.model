in june  lifecell engaged dentsply to distribute alloderm grafts for periodontal surgery on a worldwide basis 
in march  however  dentsply advised lifecell that it intends to discontinue operations of the division with responsibility for distributing alloderm 
accordingly  lifecell expects that it will terminate the agreement with dentsply and in the near future will resume marketing alloderm for periodontal applications through its direct sales force 
while the company anticipates that the termination of the dentsply agreement may have some impact on revenues attributable to sales of alloderm for periodontal applications during this transition  lifecell believes that it will not materially affect the company s overall revenues attributable to alloderm sales

the company currently intends to fund these activities from its existing cash resources  sales of products  and research and development funding received from others 
there can be no assurance that such sources of funds will be sufficient to meet these future expenses 
the company s need for additional financing will be principally dependent on the degree of market acceptance achieved by the company s products and the extent to which the company can achieve substantial growth in product sales during and as well as the extent to which the company may decide or may be required to use its own resources  in addition to external funding  to expand its product development efforts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any such additional financing on acceptable terms

federal tax laws provide for a limitation on the use of nol and tax credit carryforwards following certain ownership changes that could limit lifecell s ability to use its nol and tax credit carryforwards 
a recapitalization effected by lifecell in  the issuance of additional capital stock pursuant to its initial public offering in and its sales of equity securities in and may cause a more than percent change in ownership as defined in the applicable tax laws 
accordingly  lifecell s ability to use its nol and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future taxable income may be restricted
