item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this annual report on form k  including discussions of the company s product development plans and business strategies and market factors influencing the company s results  are forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ from those anticipated by the company as a result of various factors  both foreseen and unforeseen  including  but not limited to  the company s ability to continue to develop new products and increase systems sales in markets characterized by rapid technological evolution  consolidation  and competition from larger  better capitalized competitors 
many other economic  competitive  governmental and technological factors could impact the company s ability to achieve its goals and interested persons are urged to review the risks described in item business 
risk factors 
and in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation set forth below  as well as in the company s other public disclosures and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
general since fiscal  approximately one half of the company s revenues have been derived from sales of computer systems  upgrades and supplies  with the balance derived from systems maintenance agreements and other support services 
on sales of its systems  upgrades and supplies  the company generally recognizes its contract revenues upon shipment of its systems and products so long as the estimated costs to complete the systems are insignificant 
if such estimates to complete are significant  revenues are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the related agreements 
in the last several years  the majority of the company s clients have elected to purchase the company s maintenance and support services 
revenues from systems maintenance are typically recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
in recent years  the company s maintenance revenues have been increasing and the company anticipates that these revenues will continue to increase if systems sales increase 
however  there can be no assurance that future purchasers of the company s systems will also purchase the company s maintenance services 
furthermore  if new systems sales do not materialize  maintenance service revenues can be expected to decrease over time due to failure to capture new maintenance revenues therefrom and to attrition of existing maintenance revenues associated with the company s existing clients whose systems become obsolete or are replaced by competitors products 
in the recent past  the company s systems sales have been impacted by a number of factors which have had the effect of reducing systems sales revenues and systems upgrade revenues while at the same time increasing the potential relative profitability in percentage terms of these sales 
for example  the costs of the hardware components used in the company s systems have declined while the performance and capacity of such components have continually increased 
consistent with the marketplace  the company has adjusted its systems pricing to its clients to reflect these decreased hardware costs 
furthermore  the company increasingly encounters prospective clients that already own  or desire to acquire from third parties  significant quantities of hardware which may be utilized with the company s software 
in such instances  the revenues generated from such clients are lower than they otherwise would be 
as a result of these market changes  the company has increasingly experienced a number of new systems sales comprised of greater revenues as a percentage of the total system sale from the software user licenses and services components with reduced or no revenues from hardware components  and such systems sales generally yield higher margins than those systems sales that also include significant hardware components 
there can be no assurance that these trends will continue 
with the recent increase in the capacity of the hardware components which the company markets  the company has experienced a significant market for the sale of additional software user licenses to its existing clients because such clients can often add more software user capacity to their systems with minimal or no change to their current central processing unit 
such clients frequently also purchase hardware peripherals from the company for use with the newly purchased software user licenses 
however  there can be no assurance that these trends will continue and the company s existing client base represents a finite market that will not generate new sales indefinitely 
this trend may also negatively impact the company s sales of hardware upgrades in the future 
ultimately  the company s growth depends on new client sales 
health care providers  faced with economic pressures to reduce costs and increase productivity  are increasingly aligning with health maintenance organizations  hospitals and other health care organizations as well as consolidating with other health care providers into larger  more efficient business entities 
this trend results in an increase in the number of large and complex health care organizations that are potential clients for the company s sophisticated systems 
in addition  the potential growth of these organizations after they become clients of the company presents the potential for the company to increase sales of upgrades and additional software user licenses 
the company s ability to address the complex software requirements of such newly forming or growing business entities  in particular in the area of managed care  is a key to success in this changing health care delivery environment 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to market its systems to a significant number of these newly formed organizations and an inability to do so can have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the sales cycle for the company s systems typically ranges from three to months from initial contact to contract execution shipment 
the installation cycle is typically two to four months from contract execution shipment to completion of installation 
the company s products are generally shipped as orders are received and accordingly  the company has historically operated with minimal backlog 
as a result  sales in any quarter are dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and are not predictable with any degree of certainty 
furthermore  the company s systems can be relatively large and expensive  and individual systems sales can represent a significant portion of the company s revenues for a quarter such that the loss of even one such sale can have a significant adverse impact on the company s quarterly profitability 
clients often defer systems purchases until the company s quarter end  so quarterly results generally cannot be predicted and frequently are not known until the quarter has concluded 
because a significant percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of systems sales and installations can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
thus  the company believes that interim period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the company s research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and equipment costs required to conduct the company s product development effort 
the company believes that significant investments in research and development are required to remain competitive 
as a consequence  in recent years  the company has increased the amount of its expenditures on research and development mainly through the employment of additional development personnel 
while the company s current cash position supports research and development expenditures even during periods with relatively low revenues or gross profits  ultimately the company s ability to continue development of new products depends upon its ability to generate new revenues 
because new revenues depend to a significant degree upon new products  any interruption in either revenues or research and development efforts could adversely affect the company 
development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after technological feasibility is established  any additional development costs are capitalized and generally are amortized over three years 
in april  the company entered into a strategic relationship with clinitec  a developer of electronic medical records software systems 
in may  in connection with this relationship  the company acquired a ownership interest in clinitec for million in cash 
on may   the company acquired the remaining of clinitec for approximately million in cash plus  shares of qsi common stock and is operating clinitec as a wholly owned subsidiary 
for purposes of the may acquisition  the qsi common stock was valued at approximately million  or per share 
for accounting purposes  the acquisition was treated as a purchase transaction 
in connection with this treatment  the company incurred an million charge for purchased in process research and development during the quarter ended june  clinitec was formed in january to develop and market electronic medical records software systems 
the clinitec software products are complementary to the company s existing medical and dental practice management product solutions 
clinitec s software products have been developed using a graphical user interface client server platform utilizing desktop  laptop or pen based pc configurations for compatibility with the unix  microsoft windows  windows nt and windows operating systems together with a relational database enabling flexibility in screen customization  reporting and logic flow 
clinitec was not operating profitably prior to the acquisition and the absorption of clinitec s operating costs since the acquisition has adversely affected the company s profitability 
the company anticipates that increased sales of clinitec s products  together with operational synergies  will ultimately contribute to greater profitability 
however  clinitec s proprietary software products are relatively new and clinitec has sold only a limited quantity of these products to date 
there can be no assurance that clinitec s products will achieve broad market acceptance 
if clinitec s products are not successful  the clinitec operation will continue to impair the company s profitability 
in may  the company purchased substantially all of the assets of micromed  a developer and marketer of proprietary medical practice management systems  for up to million 
the purchase price consists of an initial cash payment of million paid upon the may closing of the transaction with an additional payment of up to million due no later than june  the additional payment will be determined using a formula based primarily upon revenues and pre tax operating income  as each is defined in the related asset purchase agreement  for the twelve month period ending march  up to of the additional payment  if any  is payable in the company s common stock at the sole election of the company with the balance of any such payment payable in cash 
the acquisition will be treated as a purchase for accounting purposes 
in connection with this treatment  the company expects to allocate a significant portion of the purchase price paid at the closing of the transaction to purchased in process research and development during the quarter ending june  micromed offers software applications that are complementary to nextgen and expands the company s practice management system product line which historically has primarily been character based software solutions 
micromed s software product has been developed using a gui client server platform for compatibility with windows and windows nt operating systems  and a relational database that is ansi sql compliant 
micromed was formed in and immediately prior to the acquisition  micromed was not operating profitably 
the company anticipates that increased sales of micromed s products  together with operational synergies  will ultimately contribute to greater profitability 
however  micromed s proprietary software products are new and micromed has sold only a limited quantity to date 
there can be no assurance that micromed s products will achieve broad market acceptance 
if micromed s products are not successful  the micromed operation will impair the company s profitability 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
historical results of operations  percentage margin fluctuations and any trends that may be inferred from the discussion below are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  the percentage of net revenues represented by each item in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the consolidated statements of operations include the operations of clinitec from may  the date of its acquisition through march  year ended march  net revenues sales of computer systems  upgrades and supplies maintenance and other services cost of products and services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development costs purchased in process research and development income loss from operations investment income equity in loss of clinitec international  inc income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss for the years ended march  and after recognizing an million charge for purchased in process research and development in connection with the clinitec acquisition  the company incurred a net loss of million  or per share on  weighted average shares outstanding  for the year ended march  as compared to net income of million  or per share on  weighted average shares outstanding  for the year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  sales of computer systems  upgrades and supplies for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  after the consolidation of clinitec s net revenues in fiscal without the inclusion of clinitec s revenues  the company s sales of computer systems  upgrades and supplies declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal net revenues from maintenance and other services during the year ended march  grew to million from million for the year ended march  resulting primarily from an increase in revenues from the company s larger client base for recurring maintenance and other services together with the consolidation of clinitec s revenues in fiscal cost of products and services 
cost of products and services for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  while costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenues increased to from during the comparable periods 
the increase in costs of products and services in both amount and as a percentage of net revenues during the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  resulted primarily from increased customer service  support  and training personnel for qsi during fiscal plus the addition of such costs for clinitec s personnel 
the increase in the amount of costs of products and services also resulted from the higher net revenues attained in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  representing and of net revenues  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in both amount and as a percentage of net revenues is primarily the result of the consolidation of clinitec s selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal and amortization expense related to certain intangible assets acquired in connection with the clinitec acquisition during fiscal as well as higher selling  general and administrative expenses resulting from an increase in qsi s selling efforts  including sales personnel  and administrative infrastructure 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues between the comparable periods also resulted from the differing cost structure of clinitec as compared to qsi s cost structure prior to the acquisition as well as qsi s decrease in revenues before the inclusion of the clinitec revenues 
research and development costs 
research and development costs for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  primarily due to the consolidation of clinitec s research and development costs during fiscal research and development costs as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively unchanged at and  respectively 
purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of clinitec in may  clinitec s in process research and development for which technological feasibility had not been established was valued at million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  software development costs must be expensed until technological feasibility has been established 
accordingly  the value of the purchased in process research and development was expensed during the year ended march  there were no comparable transactions during the year ended march  investment income and equity in loss of clinitec international  inc investment income for the year ended march  increased to million from  for the year ended march  primarily as a result of an increase in funds available for investment during fiscal arising from the company s million secondary public offering completed in march the company acquired a ownership interest in clinitec in may which the company increased to in may during the period that the company owned of clinitec  its investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting whereby the company recorded its proportionate share of clinitec s losses as equity in loss of clinitec 
commencing in may when the company acquired the remaining of clinitec  the company consolidated clinitec s results with those of its own operations 
accordingly  the equity in loss of clinitec of  for the year ended march  reflects the company s proportionate share of clinitec s net loss from the date the company acquired its ownership interest in clinitec in may through march  correspondingly  the equity in loss of clinitec of  for the year ended march  reflects the company s proportionate share of clinitec s net loss from april  until the company began consolidating clinitec s results in may when the company acquired the remaining ownership interest in clinitec 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  was  and differs from the combined federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the non deductible charge for purchased in process research and development as well as non deductible amortization of certain intangibles acquired in the clinitec purchase 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  was million  yielding a combined federal and state effective rate of which approximates the company s combined statutory rates for that period 
for the years ended march  and net income for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  similarly  net income per share on a fully diluted basis increased to from based on weighted average shares outstanding of  and  respectively 
net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  this increase was due primarily to sales of computer systems  upgrades including software user licenses and supplies which in total grew to million from million 
this growth resulted from an increase in the number of larger systems and increased sales of upgrades 
net revenues from maintenance and other services grew to million from million as a result of a growing client base for recurring services and increased time and materials billings for additional services 
cost of products and services 
cost of products and services for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  this increase was due primarily to the increases in systems sold and net revenues 
as a percentage of net revenues  costs of products and services decreased to from due to an increase in the proportion of net revenues with higher gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  as a result of increases in selling efforts and sales personnel 
however  because net revenues grew more rapidly between fiscal and fiscal as compared to the growth in selling  general and administrative expenses during the comparable period  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues declined to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal research and development costs 
research and development costs for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  total research and development costs and capitalized software costs for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  investment income 
investment income for the year ended march  increased to  from  for the year ended march  primarily as a result of an increase in funds available for investment during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in available funds for investment was significantly augmented during march with the receipt of million in net proceeds from the completion of the company s secondary public offering 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended march  increased to million from  for the year ended march  this increase in fiscal was due to increased earnings before the provision for income taxes and an increase in the company s effective tax rate 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
the effective rate for fiscal was lower than the effective rate for fiscal due to utilization in fiscal of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to net operating loss carryforwards 
all of the company s net operating loss carryforwards were utilized during fiscal and as such there were no similar tax benefits available for use in fiscal liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
net cash provided by operations for the year ended march  consisted primarily of the company s net loss adjusted for the principal non cash operating expenses of depreciation  amortization and the million charge for purchased in process research and development incurred in connection with the acquisition of clinitec  offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable during fiscal results primarily from increased sales and the timing of sales in fiscal net cash provided by operations for the year ended march  consisted principally of net income before depreciation and amortization and an increase in accounts payable offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable during fiscal results primarily from increased sales and the timing of sales in fiscal net cash provided by operations for the year ended march  consisted principally of net income before depreciation and amortization 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended march  and was principally impacted by qsi s purchase of a ownership interest in clinitec for million in cash during fiscal and qsi s purchase of the remaining ownership interest during fiscal for million in cash and  shares of common stock 
net cash provided by used in investing activities for all three years also consists of changes in short term investments as well as additions to equipment and improvements and capitalized software 
net cash provided by financing activities was  million and  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended march  consists of million of net proceeds from the company s march secondary public offering of one million shares of the company s common stock and  of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options during the year 
net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended march  and consists of the proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
at march   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of  short term investments include a  investment in a fund which trades in special situation securities 
there can be no assurance that the markets for these securities will not change  causing a loss of principal 
in march  qsi raised million to be used for general corporate purposes  including the financing of product sales growth  development of new products  working capital requirements  an increase in its ownership interest in clinitec which was completed in may  and the possible acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
the company continues to evaluate potential investment opportunities and in may acquired substantially all of the assets of micromed see item business 
micromed 
for an initial cash payment of million with an additional payment of up to million due on or before june  except for the acquisition of micromed and the company s intention to expend funds on capitalized software in connection with complementary products to its existing product line  alternative versions of certain of its products for the client server environment to take advantage of more powerful technologies and to enable a more seamless integration of the company s products  the company has no other significant capital commitments and currently anticipates that additions to equipment and improvements for fiscal will be comparable to fiscal the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand at march   together with the cash flows from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next year
