offsetting these improvements were increases in the cost of the company s basic raw materials 
the company implemented two price increases during the year in both its truck body and bus product lines to mitigate the effect of raw material cost increases 
however  based on production cycles  benefits from the selling price increases were delayed an average to weeks from the announcement while the higher raw material costs were more immediate in their impact on cost of goods sold
