 accounting for income taxes  for financial statement reporting purposes  which required a change from the deferred method apb to the assets and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
the assets and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the effect of future tax planning strategies to reduce any deferred tax liability 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements
