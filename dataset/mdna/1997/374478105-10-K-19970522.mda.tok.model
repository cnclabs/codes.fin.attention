significant factors in this slow growth in sales were increasing outside competition  low inflation and internal competition attributable to our opening new stores located near existing company stores 
the company s fourth quarter sales for the fiscal year totaled  million  which represented a decrease of million  or over the same period in fiscal same store sales during the fourth quarter of decreased as compared to fiscal these declines in the fourth quarter sales were attributable to a five week strike by the company s truck drivers and  to a lesser extent  to competition and to the unusually mild winter 
the strike caused a reduction in customer traffic and the closures of the company s distribution facilities and processing plants and also required the use of outside distributing companies to supply merchandise to the stores 
following the strike  which ended january   the company implemented an aggressive promotional discount campaign to reestablish long standing customer ties 
fourth quarter sales were also affected adversely by the unusually mild winter season in as compared to the severe winter weather in  which had resulted in record sales 
sales for the fiscal year were billion  representing an increase of million or  over sales of billion for the fiscal year 
same store sales for the fiscal year increased over fiscal this increase was principally the result of the severe winter weather in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  offset slightly by softening economic conditions and internal competition attributable to new store openings in fiscal year the cost of sales for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal  and for fiscal year the increase  in cost of sales as a percentage of sales in fiscal was attributable to strike related issues and an unusually mild winter and to changes in buying patterns and product mix

the company uses the lifo method for its nonperishable inventory 
during the last three years  the company has experienced low to moderate inflation as it relates to these inventories 
this year s lifo charge of million compares with charges of million and million for the two prior fiscal years

in  
in  and 
in for many years  the company has sought to improve its operating results by engaging in various activities which are used in support of its retail operations 
the company maintains manufacturing and processing activities in bakery  dairy  ice cream  beverage and ice cube operations 
other areas maintained in support of the retail stores are wholesaling activities including produce  pharmaceutical  snacks  magazine and vending operations 
the company has also developed support activities in the area of real estate operations through its gfs realty subsidiary  which currently manages twenty nine shopping centers 
transfer sales from manufacturing  processing and wholesaling activities approximated million during fiscal year the transfer sales represent the estimated amounts that would have been paid to an outside entity for these products 
the activities associated with these operations generated approximately million or of the company s million consolidated pre tax earnings 
both transfer sales and the associated income were lower in fiscal than in the prior year because of the work stoppage that occurred during the five week strike 
this reduction in transfer sales and the associated income contributed to the reduction of the company s margins and net income in the fourth quarter and for the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal this year s increase was principally caused by the negligible change in year to year sales resulting from the combined effects of the strike  increased competition  and the milder winter 
other factors contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were increases in occupancy costs related to new stores and the cost of electronic payments via a debit or credit card which continued to grow in fiscal the effect of the increases in occupancy costs will be reduced as the planned new stores reach projected sales levels 
in march  the company offered a co branded credit card to its customers which provided rebates of for purchases made with the card at giant or super g stores and for other purchases made with the card 
this program was well received and was advantageous to the company because the issuing bank  m t bank of new york  agreed to bear the full cost of the rebates  and also reimbursed part of the company s credit card transaction costs on all purchases made with the card at giant or super g stores 
m t bank abruptly ended the program in the first year of the five year agreement and has asserted that unforseen circumstances relating to customer payment patterns permitted this action 
in order to maintain the program  the company now offers a substitute card issued by chevy chase bank of maryland 
in order to keep the same customer rebate provision  the company will share in the cost of the rebates offered for purchases at giant or super g stores with the co branded card 
this change in terms imposes upon the company additional costs equal to of all purchases made with the card at giant or super g stores 
the company is seeking the recovery of its increased costs for the remainder of the term of the m t agreement in an arbitration proceeding

this was principally the result of lower outstanding debt due to scheduled repayments and increased capitalization of interest 
income before income taxes was million for fiscal  representing of sales  compared to million  representing of sales in the prior year 
the decrease of in income before taxes resulted from the strike  increased competition  and the milder winter  which resulted in negligible growth in total sales volume  as well as the cost of sales due to alternative procurement and reduced benefits from manufacturing and wholesaling activities during the strike 
income before income taxes for the fiscal year was million  of sales 
the increase in income from fiscal to fiscal of million  or resulted largely from the weather related increase in fourth quarter sales and the resulting increase in gross margins

competitive environment competition in the washington  dc and baltimore metropolitan areas  where the majority of the company s stores are located  has increased considerably over the past several years as additional supermarket chains and alternative format competitors have entered the market 
further  in its stores in pennsylvania  new jersey and delaware  the company is faced with intense competition from supermarket chains which are more established in these markets and its operation in these states have not yet become profitable

the new contracts are effective through march the work stoppage relating to the truck drivers was settled january  with a new agreement through may the new agreement with the truck drivers sustains the company s options to use alternative methods of supplying the company s stores when it is advantageous to the company

this clause should not materially affect the company s operation since it will allow employment of the present drivers while having the flexibility to use alternative distribution methods

under this method  the cost of merchandise sold approximates current cost and thus reduces the distortion  if any  in reported income due to increasing costs 
the historical costs of property  plant and equipment recorded by the company were incurred over a period of many years 
the cost of replacement of property  plant and equipment is generally greater than the cost on the books of the company as a result of inflation that has occurred over the years since property  plant and equipment were placed in service
