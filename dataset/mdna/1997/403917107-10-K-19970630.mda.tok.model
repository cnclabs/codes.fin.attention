overview the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
hmt technology corporation is an independent supplier of high performance thin film disks for high end  high capacity hard disk drives  which in turn are used in high end pcs  network servers and workstations 
hmt was incorporated in as a subsidiary of hitachi metals for the purpose of acquiring certain assets and certain liabilities of the thin film division of xidex corporation  which had been producing thin film disks since since completing the xidex acquisition  the company has continued to supply thin film disks to manufacturers of hard disk drives 
on november   the company effected the leveraged recapitalization pursuant to which the company repurchased from hitachi metals  then the sole stockholder of the company  all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company  and certain investment funds  members of management and hitachi metals  purchased common stock  mandatorily redeemable series a preferred stock and subordinated promissory notes 
during march and april  the company sold  shares of common stock at per share including exercise of the underwriters over allotment option through its initial public offering 
the net proceeds after underwriter s discounts and commissions and other costs associated with the initial public offering totaled million 
in january  the company completed a million private placement of the convertible notes to qualified institutional investors  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after offering costs 
proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes were used to fully redeem the million of mandatorily redeemable series a preferred stock and to prepay the million principal balance of the subordinated promissory notes issued pursuant to the leverage recapitalization plus accrued interest and to fully repay million in long term borrowings outstanding 
beginning in fiscal  hmt s management team  many of whom had joined the company since february  refocused the strategy and operations of the company 
the new management concentrated on the inch disk form factor  focused on the high end  high capacity segment of the disk drive market and expanded the company s customer base 
in addition  hmt implemented an extensive quality assurance program  developed proprietary manufacturing processes and optimized production capacity utilization 
these changes resulted in higher production volumes  lower unit costs  and higher average selling prices primarily associated with new high end products 
as a result  the company has increased sales and improved gross margins  achieving net income of million for fiscal compared with a net loss of million for fiscal the rate of improvement in the company s operating results experienced over the past two years is not expected to continue in future periods 
the company recently completed construction of a new  square foot production facility at its fremont  california site 
the administrative office areas and four production scale sputtering lines were brought into service during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company plans to install up to additional production scale sputtering lines in this new facility 
in addition  the company completed the expansion of its facility in eugene  oregon during fiscal  commencing volume production of aluminum substrates and nickel plated and polished substrates at that site 
the company derives substantially all of its sales from the sale of thin film disks to a small number of customers 
loss of or a reduction in orders from one or more of the company s customers could result in a substantial reduction in net sales 
because many of the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenues  decreases in net sales may result in a disproportionately greater negative impact on operating results 
due to the rapid technological change and frequent development of new disk drive products  it is common in the industry for the relative mix of customers and products to change rapidly  even from quarter to quarter 
at any one time the company typically supplies disks in volume for fewer than ten disk drive products 
the company has experienced a period of rapid expansion in its operations  including the organization and management of a significant expansion in manufacturing capacity that has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on the company s management and other resources 
the company s status as a public company since its march initial public offering has placed additional demands on the company s management  including its finance and accounting organization 
the company s ability to manage its operations effectively will require it to continue to improve its operational  financial and management information systems  and to train  motivate and manage its employees 
if the company s management is unable to manage its operations effectively  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
due to the changes in ownership resulting from the leveraged recapitalization  utilization of net operating losses is limited to approximately million per year over the loss carryforward period expiring between and 
the benefit from the net operating losses was recorded in the quarter ended december  had the company been obligated to pay taxes at the statutory rates for fiscal  net income would have been million

net sales were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal this represented an increase of from fiscal to fiscal  and an increase of from fiscal to fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in manufacturing capacity  resulting from the addition of new sputtering lines  and improved utilization of existing capacity and improved manufacturing processes  resulting in higher production volume and unit shipments 
the unit sales volume increased from fiscal to fiscal while average selling prices declined over the same period 
the increase in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in manufacturing capacity  primarily from improved utilization of existing capacity  improved manufacturing processes  and increased yields  resulting in higher production volume and unit shipments  as well as higher average selling prices primarily associated with the sale of new high end products 
the company anticipates that average selling prices will fluctuate with industry supply and demand 
substantially all of the company s net sales consist of products delivered to customers in asia  primarily foreign subsidiaries of us companies 
gross profit 
gross margin was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increases in gross margin in fiscal and fiscal were primarily a result of decreased unit production costs  improved utilization of manufacturing capacity  improved manufacturing processes  and the absorption of fixed costs over higher unit production volume 
production of aluminum and nickel plated substrates at the eugene  oregon manufacturing facility which was acquired during the first quarter of fiscal and lower substrate and other raw material prices also contributed to a decrease in the unit cost during fiscal increased yields in fiscal  and a manufacturing disruption experienced during the last quarter of fiscal also contributed to improved margins in fiscal compared to fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or of net sales  in fiscal  million  or of net sales  in fiscal  and million  or of net sales  in fiscal research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars in fiscal and due to an increase in headcount related to the company s new product introductions  as well as increased efforts to expand research and to provide enabling technology elements for advanced products 
the decrease of research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was primarily a result of the substantial increase in net sales over the same period 
the company develops manufacturing processes for new products directly on active production lines during the research and development phase  avoiding the need for substantial capital investment in dedicated research equipment 
the company anticipates that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods  although as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses may fluctuate 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  in fiscal  million  or of net sales  in fiscal and million  or of net sales  in fiscal the fiscal and fiscal increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars primarily reflected increased headcount necessary to support higher production volume and unit shipments 
the fiscal decline in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales primarily reflected the increase in net sales over the same period  partially offset by an increase in the selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars 
the company anticipates that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as headcount is increased to support anticipated higher levels of production volume  although as a percentage of net sales  selling general and administrative expenses may fluctuate from period to period 
recapitalization expenses 
the company effected the leveraged recapitalization on november   and recorded a million charge for related expenses for the quarter ended december  interest expense  net 
interest expense  net was million  or of net sales  in fiscal  million  or of net sales  in fiscal and million or of net sales in fiscal the fiscal decrease was primarily a result of interest earned on excess cash balances  lower average debt balances and a million increase in capitalized interest 
the fiscal increase in absolute dollars was primarily a result of higher average debt balances and interest rates  as compared to fiscal the company anticipates interest expense  net will increase in absolute dollars as a result of higher average debt balances a result of the completion of the sale of the convertible notes in january  lower invested cash balances and lower capitalized interest as construction in progress balances decrease 
provision for income taxes 
the company recorded income tax provisions of million  million and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal tax rate of approximately reflected statutory federal and state rates  reduced primarily by benefits realized from the establishment of a foreign sales corporation  utilization of state credits and implementation of other state tax planning strategies 
during fiscal  the company assessed the recoverability of deferred tax assets and  based on expectations about operating results for the fiscal year ending march  and future years  determined it was more likely than not that the entire balance of deferred tax assets would be recovered 
as the facts that supported the reduction of the valuation allowance related to the period immediately following the leveraged recapitalization  the company reduced its fiscal income tax expense by approximately million to reflect the tax benefit associated with recognition of deferred tax assets at december  the recognition of deferred tax assets and the utilization of million of net operating loss carryforwards produced an effective tax rate of for fiscal due to a loss in fiscal  the company required no federal income tax provision 
the income tax provision recorded during fiscal was based upon state income taxes of hitachi metals allocated to the company 
extraordinary debt extinguishment costs  net of income taxes 
the company repaid the balance of a senior bank term loan incurred in connection with the leveraged recapitalization on march   after completion of its initial public offering 
as a result  the company recorded a one time non cash charge of million  net of income taxes  for the write off of the portion of unamortized debt issue costs related to the senior bank term loan during fiscal liquidity and capital resources during fiscal and fiscal  the company financed its cash requirements through cash from financing activities and operations 
in fiscal  the company financed its cash requirements primarily through cash from operations 
the company s operations provided net cash of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash generated during fiscal reflected net income plus depreciation and amortization  an increase in total liabilities  and the utilization of deferred tax assets  partially offset by increases in inventories and receivables 
increased sales and improved margins contributed to the positive cash flow provided by operations in each of the past two fiscal years 
for fiscal and fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was million and million  respectively 
the company invested million and million in property  plant and equipment during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal and  net cash from financing activities was million and million  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal reflects the issuance of million in convertible notes  and the related redemption of million in series a preferred stock  prepayment of the million in subordinated promissory notes  and repayment of million in long term borrowings  as well as the receipt of million from the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option pursuant to the company s initial public offering 
as of march   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and a million unsecured revolving credit facility under which there were no borrowings 
at march   the company had indebtedness of million in convertible notes  that require semi annual interest payments beginning july  the company expects to spend in excess of million on capital expenditures directed toward expansion of production capacity over the next twelve months 
the company believes existing cash balances  cash generated from operations  and funds available under its credit facilities will provide adequate cash to fund its operations for at least the next twelve months 
while operating activities are expected to provide cash in certain periods  continued expansion of the company s manufacturing capacity may require the company to obtain additional sources of financing 
additional sources of long term liquidity could include cash generated from operations and debt and equity financings 
the company continues to have significant future obligations and expects that it may require additional capital to support continued expansion of the company s manufacturing capacity and growth  if any 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain alternative sources of financing on favorable terms  if at all  at such time or times as the company may require such capital 
recent pronouncements 
during february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 earnings per share sfas no 
which establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share eps more comparable to international eps standards 
it replaces the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps 
it also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted eps on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic eps computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted eps computation 
while the company studies the impact of the pronouncement  it continues to calculate eps based on accounting pronouncements board opinion no 
 earnings per share 
sfas no 
will be effective for the company s fiscal year  including interim periods  with a restatement of all prior period eps data presented
