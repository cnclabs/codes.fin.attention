item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s primary products during the fiscal year ended november  were telephone entertainment services  billed as pay per call services through the use of numbers and monthly billed vm services and club memberships 
these services are billed and collected through the use of service bureaus and local and long distance telephone companies and carriers 
historically  the products have evolved based on changing consumer tastes as well as changes in telephone billing practices and government regulations 
revenues are recorded at the time a customer initiates a billable transaction  except for customer fees for club and vm products and services 
new customer club and vm product fees are recognized upon approved enrollment and when the service is rendered 
continuing club and vm product fees are recognized as customers automatically renew each month 
all revenues are recognized net of an estimated provision for customer chargebacks  which include refunds  credits and uncollectible amounts 
the company estimates the reserve for monthly customer chargebacks based on updated chargeback history 
new products and platforms without a history are reserved based on experience with similar products and platforms and adjusted as further information becomes available 
since reserves are established prior to the periods in which chargebacks are actually incurred  the company s revenues may be adjusted in later periods in the event that the company s incurred chargebacks vary from estimated amounts 
during the fiscal year ended november   the company successfully marketed a new voice mail service and experienced high enrollments of new customers along with a high level of acceptance difficulties both at the consumer and regional telephone carrier levels 
this caused temporary suspensions of the company s billings by five regional telephone carriers and high levels of customer cancellations and chargebacks for the new product 
this problem began in the early part of the fiscal year and continued through the third quarter 
the company no longer markets the voice mail product but continues to service approximately  subscribers to this product and other products no longer marketed for new enrollments

such increase in chargebacks was partially offset by the change of the company s telephone entertainment services from billable numbers to numbers and the addition of the original membership clubs  both of which have historically lower chargeback rates  as well as the company s more efficient utilization of database management systems designed to reduce the number of unbillable records 
cost of sales for the year ended november  was  an increase of  or  as compared to  for the year ended november  the increase was primarily attributable to increased service bureau fees and increases in advertising expenditures for television commercials and infomercials and telemarketing

liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of  at november  the company has historically financed its working capital requirements principally through cash flow from operations and receivables financing 
in december  the company received net proceeds of approximately  from the initial public offering of its shares of common stock 
during the year ended november   the company repaid all loans related to advances received for accounts receivable financing and fully paid the notes due to shareholders for undistributed s corporation earnings 
such payments amounted to  and  respectively 
while the company is not currently financing any accounts receivable  credit lines for this purpose are being maintained and the company may incur obligations for such financing in the future 
the company s primary cash requirements have been to fund the cost of advertising and promotion 
chargebacks are paid currently from collections of receivables from carriers through the company s service bureaus 
other than the purchase of equipment in connection with the establishment of in house telemarketing operations  the expansion of its customer service department  the relocation of it its new lauderdale offices and the expansion of its computer database capabilities  the company currently has no plans or material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company anticipates  based on currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to its operations including the substantial costs associated with its proposed advertising and marketing activities  that projected cash flow from operations and available cash resources  including its financing arrangements with service bureaus  will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company does not currently have any long term obligations and currently has no plans to incur any such obligations in the future 
as the company seeks to diversify with new programs and endeavors  the board of directors  may  at its discretion  authorize the use of existing cash reserves  long term financing  or other means to finance such programs and endeavors 
during the year ended november   the company formed several new wholly owned subsidiaries and entered into two new joint venture agreements 
the joint venture agreements require the company to provide loans to the ventures in initial amounts of  each with additional amounts at the company s discretion 
such loans would bear interest at the rate of per annum and are to be repaid in installments as a percentage of the venture s retained earnings or net available cash as specified in each agreement 
additionally  the company will also advance  per month to labuick entertainment  inc for services rendered to one of the joint ventures 
such advances are deductible from distributions  if any  due labuick entertainment  inc under the agreement 
the company expects to be able to fund such loans and advances from its operating cash flow over the next twelve months and that such loans and advances  as extended  would not have a significant effect on the working capital position of the company 
during the fiscal year ended november   the new subsidiary and joint venture operations have not had a significant effect on net income and did not impose any significant cash requirements on the company 
the company does not anticipate any of these new subsidiaries or joint ventures to significantly alter the working capital or cash requirements of the company during the next twelve months 
increased chargebacks  regional telephone carrier and regulatory matters during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended november  the three month period ended february   the company increased marketing activities and experienced high enrollments of new customers which caused the company to experience a high level of acceptance difficulties with its vm enhanced product 
these acceptance difficulties occurred at two levels  consumer and regional telephone carrier 
at the consumer level  customers did not always relate the vm enhanced product billing description on their telephone bills to the entertainment service that they purchased 
this prompted an increase in customer service inquiries to both the company and esbi  the billing service bureau conduit to the regional telephone carriers and telephone companies 
accordingly  for the first nine months of  the company experienced a higher level of customer cancellations and chargebacks relating to the per month vm enhanced product 
the company no longer markets the vm enhanced product but continues to service approximately  subscribers to this and other products not marketed for new enrollments 
the company modified and repositioned this product to service the existing customer base 
the company and esbi expanded their customer service departments during the first fiscal quarter of three months ended february  to better educate the consumer about the product 
telemarketing efforts for new products during the second fiscal quarter of three months ended may  were reduced as the repositioning was being accomplished 
although there can be no assurance that these marketing efforts and changes will continue to be successful  management anticipates that the repositioning along with the expansions in customer service will maintain customer cancellations and chargebacks for the vm enhanced product and new products at acceptable levels 
several variations  including the change to offer customers a basic vm service or theme related club membership product  continue to be tested with many tests yielding positive results 
currently  only per month club products are being marketed to new customers 
the pace of telemarketing and enrollments will continue to proceed gradually  along with increased customer service support  so as not to repeat the difficulties of the first quarter 
due to the telephone company billing and collection delays inherent in the telemarketing business  the higher cancellation and chargeback level began in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended november  and continued during the current fiscal year 
see forward looking information may prove inaccurate 
at the regional telephone carrier level  five of the regional telephone carriers suspended billing of the company s vm enhanced products at different times during the fiscal year ended november  the suspensions were the result of the carriers belief that the company and esbi were unable to provide adequate customer services to vm enhanced product customers in the regions serviced by the carriers 
the company did not anticipate the increase in customer service calls during the first three months of the fiscal year ended november  and was not able to adequately handle the increased customer service call volume 
as stated above  both the company and esbi expanded their customer service departments in response to such needs 
four of the five carriers  in reaching their decisions to suspend billings  specifically addressed the company s vm enhanced product and the remaining carrier addressed the billing platform that encompasses the company s vm enhanced product 
the company has resumed billing the vm enhanced product with the four carriers that specifically addressed the difficulties associated with the vm enhanced product 
for the carrier that addressed the difficulties associated with the billing platform  the company resumed billing through an alternate platform with another service bureau 
for four of these carriers  the suspensions each lasted less than sixty days and did not have a material impact on the company s cash flows and operations 
for the fifth carrier  the suspension lasted several months and resulted in lost revenues 
during the fiscal year ended november   vm enhanced product net revenues billed through this carrier approximated of total net revenues 
marketing shifts between the vm enhanced product and business are expected to partially offset the impact of this carrier s suspension 
though the full amount of the impact of the lost revenues is not known  the company did incur marketing and fulfillment costs in this carrier s regions during the first six months of the fiscal year ended november  therefore  the impact to date has been significant as costs were incurred without a corresponding revenue stream 
the vm enhanced product is independent of the company s number entertainment services and these difficulties do not impact the number portion of the company s business 
the carrier billing suspensions of the vm enhanced product are also limited to the geographic regions serviced by the individual carriers 
the company intends to continue its promotion of both vm services and theme related club membership products as previously discussed 
also  as previously discussed  recent shifts in marketing and other strategies have increased the company s business net revenues  both absolutely and in relation to these products and services 
while the company is pursuing new vm service and club membership product enrollments  it is possible that revenues from these products and services will account for a stable or decreasing portion of the company s net revenues in the future 
since any reduction in contributions from these products and services to total net revenues are expected to be more than offset by increases in the company s business net revenues  total net revenues are expected to increase 
however no assurance can be given that these projections will prove to be accurate 
see forward looking information may prove inaccurate 
all of the company s entertainment services and advertisements are reviewed by the company s regulatory counsel  and management believes that the company is in substantial compliance with all material federal and state laws and regulations governing its provision of and number entertainment services  all of its billing and collection practices and the advertising of its services and has obtained or is in the process of obtaining all licenses and permits necessary to engage in telemarketing activities 
although the company from time to time receives requests for information from  or is forwarded consumer complaints by  regulatory authorities  the company has not been subject to any enforcement actions by any regulatory authority 
nevertheless  civil investigative demands have been received from the attorneys general of the states of idaho  missouri  new york  pennsylvania and texas  as well as from the tennessee public service commission  seeking certain information relating to the company 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended november   a proposed assurance of discontinuance was received from the oregon department of justice 
in november  the company requested oregon to clarify its position before the company could determine what  if any  future modifications to the company s practices would be necessary 
lastly  certain information relating to the company s programs has been subpoenaed from west outbound by the attorney general of the state of texas and from esbi by the attorneys general of the states of texas and idaho 
the company believes that the information has been sought as part of pending investigations in connection with certain of the company s marketing activities 
the investigation by the state of idaho has been discontinued 
the pennsylvania attorney general s investigation has concluded with issuance of a warning letter to the company 
during the summer of  the attorney general of the state of new york commenced an investigation of the company s pay per call consumer billing practices by issuing subpoenas for documents  which the company provided 
on or about october   the company submitted to the new york attorney general s office a letter  setting forth its position with respect to the investigation 
to date  the company has not received a response to its letter and there has been no further activity with respect to the investigation 
no assurance can be given  however  that such investigation is not pending or  if pending  that management will be able to amicably resolve the outstanding issues with new york state 
in the event the investigation proceeds and the company is unable to resolve the issues in dispute  further proceedings may ensue which  if the company is unsuccessful  may have a materially adverse effect on the company s future operations in new york state 
management further believes that while the other remaining investigations will not result in enforcement actions or claims which would have a material adverse effect on the company  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
amendments to or interpretations and enforcement of existing statutes and regulations  adoption of new statutes and regulations and the company s expansion into new jurisdictions and number services could require the company to continually alter methods of operations  modify the content or use of its services or the manner in which it markets it services  which could result in material interruptions in its operations 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the company to civil remedies  including substantial fines  penalties and injunctions  as well as possible criminal sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on the company
