this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include without limitation  those set forth below under the caption factors that may affect future results 
results of operations cayenne s operating results for the transition period ended december  and prior fiscal periods ended june  and  respectively  were significantly adversely affected by the market trends of the company s customers moving from mainframe development and structured analysis towards client server and object oriented solutions  together with cayenne s efforts to respond to those trends 
additionally  the contraction of federal defense programs has led to industry consolidation thereby reducing the company s customer base for its technical embedded products 
in particular  cayenne s business operations in fiscal were significantly adversely affected by the severing of substantially all of its relationships with ibm 
cayenne historically relied heavily on its relationship with ibm for development and marketing of its products 
prior to fiscal  cayenne s products were designed primarily for organizations that employed ibm and ibm compatible mainframe computers  mvs operating system and the db relational database management system 
as a result  the market for cayenne s products has been directly affected by declines in the acceptance of those ibm and ibm compatible products 
prior to january  cayenne was a member of ibm s international alliances for ad cycle  systemview and information warehouse 
cayenne also maintained a close technical relationship with ibm  which provided cayenne with access to technical information concerning certain current and planned developments in ibm products and systems 
ibm marketed cayenne s products in the united states  canada  puerto rico  and austria prior to july  and continues to be a non exclusive distributor of cayenne s products in certain asia pacific countries and switzerland 
ibm was cayenne s single largest customer during the transition period ended december  and in the previous fiscal years ended june   and when revenue from ibm including license and maintenance fees paid by ibm in connection with its own use of cayenne products  as well as amounts paid by ibm as a distributor and systems integrator accounted for    and of cayenne s total revenue  respectively 
while cayenne expects its broadened focus will benefit cayenne in the long term  there can be no assurance that the foregoing trends will not materially adversely affect either the success with which cayenne develops  supports  and sells products for use with ibm and ibm compatible computers and systems or the extent to which ibm continues to be a customer of cayenne 
the foregoing events may limit cayenne s ability to compete as effectively in the ibm and ibm compatible market  particularly with companies that continue to be members of ibm s international alliances
