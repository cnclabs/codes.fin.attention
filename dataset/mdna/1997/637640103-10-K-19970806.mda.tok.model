item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto overview in the first quarter of fiscal  under the leadership of the company s new chief executive officer  national semiconductor corporation national or the company adopted a strategy to provide system on a chip solutions for its key data highway strategic partners  exploiting its analog and mixed signal expertise as a starting point for forward integration 
this strategy led to the company s decision to de emphasize some of its existing business areas 
in june  the company reorganized its operating structure into four business groups that included the analog group  the communications and consumer group  the personal systems group and the fairchild semiconductor group fairchild 
the reorganization was intended to enhance the company s focus in analog and mixed signal technologies and further its strategy to develop certain highly integrated  application specific semiconductor products systems on a chip for the personal systems  communications and consumer markets 
fairchild was formed as a separate organization consisting of the company s family logic  memory and discrete product lines  which the company announced it planned to divest as part of this strategy 
the fairchild product lines were more mature businesses with slower growth rates and generally lower margins than the analog and mixed signal products  which traditionally have higher margins 
the company completed the disposition of fairchild under a recapitalization transaction with sterling  llc  a citicorp venture capital  ltd 
investment portfolio company in related businesses  and fairchild s management  in march early in fiscal  the company also established three strategic imperatives state of the art process technology  world class manufacturing and a six month time to market methodology as delivery vehicles to enable the company to develop system on a chip products 
in line with the strategic imperatives  the company aggressively developed its own state of the art  submicron wafer fabrication capability and accelerated completion of its new inch manufacturing facility in south portland  maine  to provide the appropriate manufacturing technology for the types of analog and mixed signal devices needed for system on a chip products 
as a result  the company also bypassed previously developed processes that are used in its current manufacturing facilities 
in may  the company announced a comprehensive realignment of its manufacturing facilities intended to reduce costs  rationalize production flows and accelerate its production transition to manufacturing inch wafers with micron circuit geometries 
also consistent with the new strategy were the company s acquisitions of the picopower division of cirrus logic inc picopower in august and mediamatics  inc mediamatics in march the acquisition of picopower  a well established designer and marketer of chip sets for laptop personal computers  allows the company to compete as a supplier of complete chip sets for future generations of products by combining its expertise in circuits for peripheral and input output functions on the personal computer motherboard with picopower s advanced technologies and experience in other components of chip sets 
the company believes that the acquisition of mediamatics  a leading supplier of certain multimedia products in the home connectivity market  will enable the company to accelerate its entry into the rapidly growing world of home entertainment appliances based on new technologies such as digital versatile disk based video players and digital video broadcasting set top boxes 
results of operations the company recorded net sales of billion in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal and billion in fiscal net income for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in net income was primarily attributable to a combination of lower sales from fairchild as a result of its disposition early in the fourth quarter of fiscal and special charges of million 
the special charges comprised million for restructuring of operations that included million related to the company s reorganization of its operating structure and million related to the planned realignment of its manufacturing facilities  plus million for in process research and development charges related to the acquisition of picopower million and mediamatics million  offset by a million gain from the disposition of fairchild 
in connection with the company s acquisition of mediamatics  the company issued or reserved for future issuance an aggregate of million shares of common stock  with million of these shares reserved for stock options and employee retention arrangements 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase accounting method with a net adjusted purchase price after acquisition expenses of million 
in addition to the charge to expense of in process research and development  the company recorded million of unearned compensation related to employee retention arrangements which will be charged to operating expenses  primarily research and development  over the next months 
the decrease in net income for fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to a combination of lower than expected sales and higher costs associated with reduced factory utilization experienced in the second half of fiscal as the company and the global semiconductor industry experienced much slower order activity due to over inventory conditions at its customers and distributors 
results for fiscal also included special charges of million related to the acquisition of sitel sierra  bv sitel  a netherlands company that designs and supplies integrated circuits and software based on the digital european cordless telephone dect telecommunications protocol for the wireless market  and a charge of million associated with various cost reduction programs announced in late fiscal taken to align costs with market conditions 
the following table summarizes selected financial information for the national core businesses excluding the effect of special charges related to the company s reorganization of its operating structure  its planned realignment of manufacturing facilities and in process research and development charges related to the acquisitions of picopower and mediamatics in fiscal and sitel in fiscal  as previously described  and the results of operations of fairchild and dynacraft  inc dci  which was sold in the third quarter of fiscal years ended may  may  may  in millions net sales    gross profit gross margin net income fully diluted earnings per share the presentation of these separate national core business earnings per share eps amounts is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company believes  however  that for analytical purposes  these eps amounts represent the contributions of the national core businesses and are an appropriate basis for comparison with future financial results from the national core businesses 
sales sales in fiscal decreased overall by percent from sales for fiscal while sales declined in the first half of fiscal by percent  sales for the second half of fiscal grew percent despite lower sales from fairchild due to the disposition of fairchild in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in sales for the first half of fiscal reflected the general slowdown in new orders that began in fiscal and continued into the first half of fiscal as customers and distributors reduced inventories 
the sales growth experienced in the second half of fiscal reflected an improvement in new orders that began in the second half of calendar year and continued to strengthen through the rest of the fiscal year 
national core businesses include the analog group  the communications and consumer group  and the personal systems group 
the sales discussion that follows for fiscal is presented separately for the national core businesses and fairchild 
sales for fiscal for national s core businesses were billion  or percent of total sales  compared to billion  or percent  for fiscal this growth in sales for the national core businesses was driven by the company s focus on analog and mixed signal market opportunities and reflects the continued growth in sales for local area network products and wide area network products  including application specific wireless communication products  each of which grew with increases of percent and percent  respectively  over fiscal in addition  sales strengthened for personal computer products  which grew percent over fiscal sales increases for all of these product areas were the result of increased unit shipments 
overall  increased unit shipments for the national core businesses resulted in increased sales for the year despite some modest price declines 
sales for fiscal for fairchild were billion  or percent of total sales  compared to billion  or percent  for fiscal the decline in sales for fairchild reflects the company s continued de emphasis of those businesses as well as the effect of the disposition of fairchild in the fourth quarter of fiscal overall decreases in unit shipments as older product lines were reduced  together with some modest price declines  resulted in decreased sales for fairchild year over year 
overall  fiscal sales decreased in all geographic regions from fiscal the decreases were percent for the americas  percent for europe  percent for japan and percent for asia 
although the dollar value of foreign currency denominated sales had an unfavorable impact in japan as the dollar strengthened against the japanese yen  it was offset by a favorable impact experienced in europe  particularly from the german deutsche mark 
overall  exchange rates had a minimal effect on total sales since the majority of the company s sales are us dollar denominated 
in fiscal  sales in the americas increased to percent of total sales  while sales for europe declined to percent of total sales and sales remained consistent at percent of total sales for japan and percent of total sales for asia 
the disposition of fairchild had an immaterial effect on these percentages 
sales for fiscal increased overall by percent over fiscal while sales growth for the first half of fiscal was percent over sales for the first half of fiscal  sales for the second half of fiscal remained flat with sales for the second half of fiscal moreover  sales for the second half of fiscal actually declined percent from sales for the first half of fiscal  reflecting a general slowdown in new orders that was experienced as customers and distributors reduced inventories 
fiscal sales increased in all geographic regions over fiscal the increases were percent for the americas  percent for europe  percent for japan and percent for asia 
the dollar value of foreign currency denominated sales was minimally affected by exchange rates as favorable currency movements in the first half of the year were offset in the second half of the year as the dollar began to strengthen against the japanese yen and major european currencies 
overall  the americas  europe  japan and asia regions accounted for   and percent of total fiscal sales  respectively 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales declined to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal the primary factor contributing to the decline was reduced factory utilization  particularly in the first half of fiscal when factory utilization was reduced due to the slowdown in new orders as customers and distributors reduced inventories 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization declined to percent for the first half of fiscal resulting in gross margin of percent for the first half of the year 
although gross margin for fiscal was lower than fiscal  it reflects a recovery in gross margin since the beginning of the fiscal year as factory utilization reached percent in the second half of fiscal this resulted in gross margin of percent for the second half of the year as new order rates that began improving in august strengthened through the remainder of the fiscal year 
gross margin for fiscal also reflects the positive effect of ceasing depreciation expense on the property and equipment of the fairchild businesses held for disposition 
had the company continued to record depreciation expense on those assets during the year  gross margin for the year would have been percent 
included in the fiscal cost of sales are special charges of million related to the write down of fairchild inventory to net realizable value and million for other cost reduction activities see restructuring of operations 
gross margin for fiscal for the national core businesses without fairchild and excluding these special charges was percent 
gross margin as a percentage of sales declined to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the primary factor contributing to the decline was reduced factory utilization in the second half of fiscal due to the slowdown in new orders as customers and distributors reduced inventories coupled with a general increase in operating expenses 
in fiscal  gross margin for the first half of the year increased to percent due to high product demand  particularly in the higher margin analog products 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization reached percent 
in the second half of the year  wafer fabrication capacity utilization declined to approximately percent as the company reduced production output in an effort to keep inventories in balance with decreasing demand 
this resulted in a decline in gross margin to percent for the second half of fiscal research and development research and development r d expenses were million for fiscal  or percent of sales  compared to million in fiscal  or percent of sales  and million in fiscal  or percent of sales 
these amounts exclude in process r d charges of million related to the acquisitions of picopower million and mediamatics million in fiscal  million related to the acquisition of sitel in fiscal and million related to the acquisition of comlinear corporation in fiscal  which have been separately presented in the consolidated statement of operations as special items 
the increase in fiscal r d expenses reflects the company s accelerated investment in advanced submicron cmos process technology  which was directly attributable to the company s strategic imperative for state of the art process technology 
the increase also reflects continued investment in the development of new analog and mixed signal based products for applications in the personal systems  communications and consumer markets 
for fiscal  the company expended percent of its r d effort toward the development of state of the art process technology and the remaining percent for new product development 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal from million  or percent of sales  in fiscal and million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the decrease is attributable to certain ongoing cost reduction actions that were implemented in response to the slowdown in market conditions that affected the first half of fiscal and the effect of centralization initiatives to reduce the company s infrastructure in both fairchild and the continuing national core business areas 
the decrease also reflects lower expenses due to the disposition of fairchild in the fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring of operations in connection with the reorganization  the company recorded a million net special charge for fiscal that included a million restructuring charge for the write down of fixed assets to estimated fair value  as well as costs associated with staffing reductions and other exit costs necessary to reduce the company s infrastructure in both fairchild and the remaining national core businesses 
the remaining components of the million special charge are recorded in cost of sales and consist of million to write down certain fairchild inventory to net realizable value and million for other cost reduction activities 
in connection with the company s planned realignment of its manufacturing facilities  the company recorded a restructuring charge of million that included an impairment loss of million related to the write down of certain assets in its arlington  texas  wafer manufacturing facility 
this impairment arose from the company s decision to cancel further investment in its inch  micron wafer fabrication expansion that began in the company s acceleration of investment in its inch wafer fabrication facility in maine  which is expected to result in availability of micron capacity sooner than previously expected  will allow the company to bypass the micron generation of capacity 
in addition to the impairment loss  the company also recorded million of exit costs primarily related to the closure of its and inch wafer fabrication facilities in santa clara  california 
the closure process  which began in may  is expected to occur over the next months  during which time the company will transfer the production activities to other existing manufacturing lines 
the exit costs primarily relate to severance costs  the removal of production equipment and the dismantling of the production facilities 
approximately employees are currently employed in these two wafer fabrication facilities and the company does not expect to place the majority of the affected employees elsewhere in the organization 
the company also recorded million of exit costs associated with the company s decision to halt expansion of its inch wafer fabrication line in greenock  scotland 
these costs primarily relate to asset write off of previously capitalized construction in progress costs and other exit costs including employee related costs 
the remaining million relates to severance and other exit costs at other manufacturing facilities 
included in accrued liabilities at may  is million of the restructuring charge that represents cash charges 
noncash charges of million include the impairment loss and other fixed asset write downs 
interest income and interest expense net interest income was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to lower interest expense reflecting the company s efforts to accelerate the paydown of certain debt balances  as interest income remained constant 
in addition  the company capitalized million of interest associated with capital expansion projects in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net interest income was lower in fiscal than in fiscal as the increase in interest expense associated with the million convertible subordinated notes issued in fiscal more than offset the increase in interest income earned from higher cash balances during fiscal other income  net other income  net was million for fiscal compared to million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal  other income  net included million of net intellectual property income  plus a million net gain from the sale of stock from the company s investment holdings  a million gain from the sale of a digital answering machine integrated circuit business and million of dividend income from an investment holding  offset by million attributable to the write down of an investment to net realizable value 
this compares to net intellectual property income of million  plus a million net gain from the sale of investment holdings and a million gain from the sale of dci  offset by million attributable to the write down of certain investments to net realizable value for fiscal and net intellectual property income of million  plus a million net gain from the sale of investment holdings  offset by a special royalty charge of million for fiscal in fiscal  the company s intellectual property income declined because several large license arrangements expired in fiscal although the expired licenses had generated an aggregate of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  none of the license arrangements was considered individually material 
income tax expense income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was percent as compared to approximately percent and percent in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was attributable to the exhaustion of tax credits and certain net operating loss carryovers in various tax jurisdictions 
the primary cause of the increase in the fiscal tax rate is the effect of the million nondeductible charge for in process r d related to the acquisition of mediamatics through the issuance of the company s common stock 
foreign operations the company has manufacturing facilities in southeast asia and europe and sales offices throughout the united states  southeast asia  europe and japan 
a portion of the transactions at these facilities are denominated in local currency  which exposes the company to risk from exchange rate fluctuations 
the company s risk exposure from expenses at foreign manufacturing facilities is concentrated in pound sterling  singapore dollar and malaysian ringgit 
net non us dollar denominated asset and liability positions are hedged  where practical  using forward exchange and purchased option contracts 
the company s risk exposure from foreign revenue is limited to the japanese yen and major european currencies  primarily german deutsche marks  french francs and italian lira 
the company hedges up to percent of the notional value of outstanding customer orders denominated in foreign currency using forward exchange contracts and over the counter foreign currency options 
a portion of anticipated foreign sales commitments is  at times  managed using purchased option contracts that have an original maturity of one year or less 
financial condition as of may   cash and short term investments increased to a total of million from a total of million at may  cash generated from operating activities was million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  primarily due to increasing working capital as a result of decreases in inventories and receivables and an increase in income taxes 
cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal for fiscal  capital expenditures of million were offset by cash proceeds of million from the disposition of fairchild and million from the sale of a note receivable resulting in decreased cash used for investing activities compared to previous years 
capital expenditures for fiscal slightly decreased from million in fiscal as the company continued to invest in property  plant and equipment to expand its manufacturing capabilities and modernize existing plants 
the decrease reflects the effect of the fairchild disposition in the fourth quarter of fiscal as well as the effect of the company s decision to cancel further investment in the inch wafer fabrication expansion in arlington  texas 
capital expenditures in fiscal included construction of an inch  micron pilot wafer fabrication line at its research and development facility in santa clara  california  expansion of the company s bicmos inch wafer fabrication facility in south portland  maine  that was later transferred to fairchild  construction of an inch  micron wafer fabrication facility  also in south portland  and expansion of a cmos wafer fabrication facility in arlington  texas 
the company s financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal primarily from the proceeds of a million draw down in november on a new equipment loan and million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans  offset by general debt repayment of million 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities of million was primarily due to the proceeds of million  net of issuance costs  from the private placement of convertible subordinated notes and million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans  offset by the repurchase of  shares of common stock on the open market for million 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities of million was provided by debt proceeds of million and million from issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans  offset by million of debt repayment and the repurchase of  shares of common stock on the open market for million 
management foresees significant cash outlays for plant and equipment throughout fiscal the fiscal capital expenditure level is expected to be slightly higher than the fiscal level 
existing cash and investment balances  together with existing lines of credit  are expected to be sufficient to finance planned fiscal capital investments 
recently issued financial accounting standards in  the financial accounting standards board released three new statements 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosure of information about capital structure  requires certain disclosures regarding capital structure and is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is presently analyzing these statements and has not yet determined their impact on the company s financial statements 
outlook the statements contained in this outlook and in the financial condition section of management s discussion and analysis are forward looking based on current expectations and management s estimates 
actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such forward looking statements 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent introduction of new technology leading to more complex and more integrated products 
the result is a cyclical environment with short product life  price erosion and high sensitivity to the overall business cycle 
in addition  substantial capital and r d investment is required to support products and manufacturing processes 
as a result of industry conditions  the company may experience periodic fluctuations in its operating results 
the company intends to continue to focus on major customers in the personal systems  communications and consumer markets with continued emphasis in analog and mixed signal market opportunities 
the company s strategy is to provide system on a chip solutions for its key data highway strategic partners  exploiting its analog and mixed signal expertise as a starting point for forward integration 
the company expects to grow at or above market rates of growth in particular segments of the analog and mixed signal markets 
although business conditions for the semiconductor industry remained weak as the company entered fiscal  the company saw improving resales in the semiconductor distribution channel in the us market and some improvement in orders from personal computer manufacturers during the first half of fiscal by the second half of fiscal  the company was experiencing significant improvement in new order rates 
new orders were strong and continued to strengthen through the rest of the fiscal year 
the company expects this trend to continue into the first half of fiscal  however  the company faces the risk that the current improvement in the semiconductor industry may be of short duration 
if the rate of new orders does not continue to increase  the company may be unable to attain the level of revenue growth expected for fiscal and operating results will be unfavorably affected 
additionally  the rate of orders and product pricing may be affected by continued and increasing competition and by growth rates in the personal computer and networking industries 
while business conditions and overall market pricing have a major influence on gross margin  the company s planned expansion and modernization of current facilities  improvements in manufacturing efficiency  realignment of wafer fabrication facilities  focus on analog and mixed signal products and introduction of new products are expected to result in future gross margin improvement 
future gross margin improvement is also predicated on increased new order rates in future periods  particularly in the higher margin multimarket analog products 
the company anticipates bringing new manufacturing capacity on line in early fiscal with the accelerated investment in its inch wafer fabrication facility in south portland  maine  which will utilize advanced micron cmos process technology 
if the balance of fixed costs associated with the realignment of wafer fabrication facilities is affected because the new facility is not filled with new products going into fiscal  future gross margin will be unfavorably impacted 
the company has committed substantial capital investments to bring new manufacturing capacity on line for fiscal while management expects to more fully utilize wafer capacity  there is no certainty that the level of demand will be sufficient to fully utilize the additional new capacity when it is brought on line 
failure to improve manufacturing capacity utilization will lead to flat or decreased gross margin for fiscal in addition  unexpected start up expenses  inefficiencies and delays in the start of production in the company s new inch wafer fabrication facility in south portland  maine  may result in lower than expected gross margin for fiscal the company s focus is to continue to introduce new products  particularly higher margin analog and mixed signal based products  and to reposition its product portfolio so that it is less exposed to the pricing declines of older commodity products 
if the development of new products is delayed or market acceptance is below expectations  future gross margin may also be affected 
in connection with the company s planned comprehensive realignment of its manufacturing facilities  the company faces the risk that the transfer of product manufacturing from existing facilities that are expected to be closed or where capacity levels are expected to be reduced may extend beyond the estimated transition period and that the transition process may not occur smoothly  resulting in an unfavorable impact on future gross margin and operating results 
the company believes that continued focused investment in research and development is a key factor to the company s successful growth 
ongoing research and development spending for fiscal is expected to exceed fiscal levels 
national s product portfolio  particularly products in the personal systems and communications area  have short product life cycles and successfully developing and introducing new products is critical to the company s ability to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace 
the company s ability to achieve strong financial performance is also dependent on the development of new manufacturing processes and the timely development and market acceptance of new products 
the company does expect  however  that overall sg a expenses will be lower for fiscal than for fiscal as management continues to evaluate strategies to align its cost structure with current market conditions 
national continues to pursue opportunities to leverage its intellectual property 
however  the timing and amount of future licensing income over time cannot be forecast with certainty 
in addition  the company continues to pursue opportunities to develop joint venture partnerships or potential acquisitions which enhance its product portfolio in analog and mixed signal applications and pursue its system on a chip strategy 
the company expects that its involvement in such opportunities  particularly in the acquisition of key technology  will become more significant in the future  as the company pursues acquisitions of key technology to augment technical capability or achieve faster time to market rather than internally developing them 
with such acquisitions  the company faces the risk that future operating performance may be unfavorably impacted due to acquisition related costs  such as but not limited to  in process r d charges  added r d expenses  lower gross margins from acquired product portfolios and restructure costs associated with duplicate facilities 
the company s joint venture in the people s republic of china china to design  manufacture and market subscriber line interface modules and other products using similar technologies is dependent on the development of a telecommunication infrastructure in china 
the company also has another joint venture in china to establish the dect technology in china and pursue the development  manufacturing and sale of related products 
the success of these joint ventures is subject to market acceptance  as well as the general economic conditions and political environment in china 
the company continues to critically evaluate product lines and divisions where short or long term prospects do not coincide with its overall strategic direction 
in these cases  the company will consider dispositions of assets or business entities as necessary 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in these endeavors or that such endeavors will provide future growth 
because of significant international operations  the company benefits overall from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
as such  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may unfavorably affect the company s consolidated sales and net income 
the company attempts to manage the short term exposures to foreign currency fluctuations  but there can be no assurance that the company s risk management activities will offset the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange 
although the company transferred four manufacturing facilities as a part of the fairchild transaction  the company believes that its remaining captive manufacturing capacity and its third party subcontract manufacturing arrangements  including manufacturing arrangements with fairchild  will be adequate to supply the needs of its core business operations 
moreover  the company believes the portfolio of products for its core businesses provides the company the opportunity to improve future profitability since such products have higher margins historically than those of the fairchild businesses 
as part of the fairchild transaction  the company has agreed not to compete with fairchild for five years in any business that has products with substantially the same specifications as the products comprising the fairchild business immediately prior to the transaction 
fairchild has agreed it will not compete with the company in certain products for a period of months 
the company has also agreed not to encourage any fairchild customer  supplier  licensor  licensee or anyone else having a business relationship with fairchild to terminate its business relationship with fairchild 
since the company has exited the logic  memory and discrete product business  the company does not believe these noncompetition and nonsolicitation covenants will materially impact the ongoing operations 
in connection with the fairchild transaction  fairchild and the company have entered into a manufacturing agreement under which the company will purchase goods and services from fairchild during the first months after the transaction 
historically  these goods and services have been provided by fairchild at cost 
under the agreement  the company has committed to purchase goods and services based on specified wafer prices 
such prices may have an unfavorable impact on gross margin 
the agreement also requires the company to purchase a minimum of million in goods and services based on annual minimum levels over the term of the agreement 
the company is committed to these minimum levels whether or not the minimum levels are required based on future demand 
the company also has certain continuing obligations arising from the fairchild transaction that include providing certain transition services to fairchild and indemnification of certain environmental and legal matters 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate satisfaction of these obligations would not have a material adverse impact on the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
the company has received notices of tax assessments from certain governments of countries within which the company operates 
there can be no assurance that these governments or other government entities will not serve future notices of assessments on the company  or that the amounts of such assessments and the failure of the company to favorably resolve such assessments would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the company is engaged in administrative tax appeals with the irs and the company s tax returns for certain years are under examination in the us and malaysia 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of the tax appeals or tax examinations would not have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
the forward looking statements discussed or incorporated by reference in this outlook section involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
other risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the general economy  regulatory and international economic conditions  the changing environment of the semiconductor industry  competitive products and pricing  growth in the personal computer and communications industries  the effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings  and such other risks and uncertainties as may be detailed from time to time in the company s sec reports and filings
