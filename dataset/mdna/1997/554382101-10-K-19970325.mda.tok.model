item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the company s consolidated and predecessor combined financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this k 
general background and performance measurement the company receives income primarily from two sources through its ownership of wholly owned centers 
through its ownership interests in joint venture centers which include panorama mall  broadway plaza  north valley plaza  and west acres shopping center 
general background and performance measurement  continued the company believes that the most significant measures of its operating performance are funds from operations and ebitda 
funds from operations is defined as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities 
adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis 
funds from operations does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
ebitda represents earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  minority interest  income in unconsolidated entities and extraordinary items 
this data is relevant to an understanding of the economics of the shopping center business as it indicates cash flow available from operations to service debt and satisfy certain fixed obligations 
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the company s operating performance  or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
while the performance of individual centers and the management companies determines ebitda  the company s capital structure also influences funds from operations 
the most important component in determining ebitda and funds from operations is center revenues 
center revenues consist primarily of minimum rents  percentage rents and tenant expense recoveries 
minimum rents will increase to the extent that new leases are signed at market rents that are higher than prior rents 
minimum rent will also fluctuate up or down with changes in the occupancy level 
additionally  to the extent that new leases are signed with more favorable expense recovery terms  expense recoveries will increase 
percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant sales 
as leases roll over  however  a significant portion of historical percentage rent is often converted to minimum rent 
it is therefore common for percentage rents to decrease as minimum rents increase 
accordingly  in discussing financial performance  the company combines minimum and percentage rents in order to better measure revenue growth 
the following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the company for the years ended december  and  and for the period from march  commencement of operations through december   and the combined financial statements of macerich predecessor affiliates predecessor for the period from january  through march  the combined financial statements of the predecessor combine the balance sheet data and results of operations of the partnerships that previously owned of the properties and of the management and leasing operations of the predecessor which were contributed to the company 
the predecessor is considered the predecessor entity to the company and the combined financial statements are presented for comparative purposes 
the following discussion compares the activity for the year ended december  to results of operations for also included is a comparison of the activities for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december   which includes a summation of the company s and the predecessor s results of operations for this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements and notes thereto 
on march  the company acquired crossroads mall crossroads ok located in oklahoma city  oklahoma and on july  the company acquired chesterfield towne center chesterfield in richmond  virginia 
crossroads ok and chesterfield are collectively referred to herein as the acquisition centers 
in august   the company acquired the centre at salisbury salisbury in salisbury  maryland  and in december  the company acquired two malls  capitola mall capitola  in capitola  california  and queens center queens  in queens  new york 
these properties are known as the acquisition centers

these properties are known as the acquisition centers 
the financial statements include the results of the acquired properties from their acquisition dates 
as a result  many of the variations in the results of operations  discussed below  occurred due to the addition of these properties to the company s portfolio during  and many factors  such as availability and cost of capital  overall debt to market capitalization level  interest rates and availability of potential acquisition targets that meet the company s criteria  impact the company s ability to acquire additional properties 
accordingly  management is uncertain as to whether during and future years there will be similar acquisitions and corresponding increases in revenues  net income and funds from operations that occurred as a result of the  and acquisitions 
general background and performance measurement  continued the bankruptcy and or closure of retail stores  particularly anchors  may reduce customer traffic and cash flow generated by a center 
during  federated department stores  inc announced the closure of the broadway stores at panorama and huntington center and weinstock s at parklane 
the company acquired weinstock s leasehold interest in and is negotiating with a replacement 
federated is currently negotiating with another retailer to sell the former panorama broadway building 
the huntington center broadway store is being demolished and replaced with a screen theater complex 
all three stores remained closed through december  the long term closure of these or other stores could adversely affect the company s performance 
in addition  the company s success in the highly competitive real estate shopping center business depends upon many other factors  including general economic conditions  the ability of tenants to make rent payments  increases or decreases in operating expenses and interest rates  occupancy levels  changes in demographics  competition from other centers and forms of retailing and the ability to renew leases or relet space upon the expiration or termination of leases

these reductions partially offset the increase of million from the and acquisition centers 
depreciation and amortization depreciation increased to million from million in an increase of approximately million related to the and acquisition centers 
this increase was offset by a decrease of approximately million in amortization of financial instruments in which resulted from several financial instruments becoming fully amortized in minority interest the minority interest represents the weighted average interest of the operating partnership that is not owned by the company during gain loss from unconsolidated joint ventures and management companies the gain from unconsolidated joint ventures and the management companies was million for  essentially the same as extraordinary loss on early retirement of debt in connection with the sale of an interest rate cap  the company wrote off unamortized financing costs of million in in the company wrote off million of loan costs concurrent with the refinancing of lakewood mall 
net income as a result of the foregoing  net income increased to million in from million in operating activities cash flow from operations increased to million compared to million in the increase resulted from the factors discussed above  primarily the impact of the and acquisition centers

the primary reason for the balance of the increase was contractual rent increases in existing leases  and replacement of expiring leases with renewal leases at higher minimum rents 
tenant recoveries increased by  to  for the year ended december   compared to the same period of the acquisition centers accounted for  of this increase in recoveries and the acquisition centers accounted for  the balance of the increase resulted primarily from increased recoverable expenses at the other properties

subsequent to the ipo  the management companies are accounted for on the equity method and included in income from unconsolidated joint ventures and management companies

expenses shopping center expenses increased by  to  for an increase of  was due to the acquisition centers and  was due to the acquisition centers 
the increase due to the acquisition centers was partially offset by reduced expense of  due to the purchase in october of a parcel of land at crossroads mall boulder which had previously been ground leased 
in addition  real estate taxes  excluding the and acquisition centers  increased by  due to reassessments 
there were no management and leasing expenses in compared to  for this decrease is a result of the management companies being accounted for on the equity method after march  general and administrative expenses of the company were  compared to  during this difference was primarily due to the company being operational for only nine and one half months in interest expense interest expense increased by from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for this was partially due to interest expense of  for the acquisition centers and  for the acquisition centers 
there was a reduction in same center interest expense in primarily due to the net reduction of approximately  of debt in march  subsequent to the ipo 
during  there was a full year of benefit from those reductions 
depreciation and amortization depreciation increased by  to  for the twelve months ended december  the acquisition centers accounted for  of the difference and the acquisition centers that were purchased in  but depreciated for a full year in  accounted for  also contributing to this increase was  related to additional depreciation of the acquisition cost of partnership interests 
minority interest in operating partnership the minority interest in the operating partnership represents the weighted average interest in the operating partnership that is not owned by the company at december  gain loss from unconsolidated joint ventures and management companies the gain from unconsolidated joint ventures and the management companies increased to  for compared to  for this increase was primarily due to net income at broadway plaza increasing by  largely resulting from the addition of  square feet of space which was completed during and reduction of the interest expense due to a debt reduction in march  the company owns a joint venture interest in broadway plaza

also contributing to the decrease was  of contributions to joint ventures which was primarily used to pay down debt at the joint ventures 
during  the decrease in cash flow due to investing activities related primarily to cash expended for the acquisition centers 
financing activities financing activities reflected net cash flow of  in  compared to  in this was primarily the result of the ipo in compared to the equity offering and refinancings in ebitda and funds from operations due to factors described above  ebitda increased to  from  in funds from operations increased by to  in from  in liquidity and capital resources the company intends to meet its short term liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations and working capital reserves 
the company anticipates that revenues will continue to provide necessary funds for its operating expenses and debt service requirements  and to pay dividends to stockholders in accordance with reit requirements 
the company anticipates that cash generated from operations  together with cash on hand  will be adequate to fund capital expenditures which will not be reimbursed by tenants  other than non recurring capital expenditures 
capital for major expenditures or redevelopments has been  and is expected to continue to be  obtained from equity or debt financings

the company has a line of credit up to million 
there was million outstanding at december  and outstanding at december  at december  the company had cash and cash equivalents available of million 
funds from operations the company believes that the most significant measure of its performance is funds from operations ffo 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit to be net income  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
this is herein referred to as ffo original definition 
in may  nareit issued a revised interpretation of ffo 
this revised definition of ffo ffo new definition excludes the add back of non real estate depreciation and amortization 
extraordinary items and significant non recurring events are also excluded from ffo new definition 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
the following reconciles net income to the ffo original definition to the ffo new definition 
pro forma amounts in thousands net income    adjustments to reconcile net income to ffo original definition minority interest    depreciation and amortization on wholly owned properties    pro rata share of unconsolidated entity depreciation and amortization    extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt  pro rata share of gain loss on sale of joint venture assets sub total ffo original definition    adjustments to reconcile to ffo new definition amortization of loan costs  including interest rate caps and swaps    depreciation of personal property ffo new definition    company s share of ffo new definition    weighted average number of shares outstanding  assuming full conversion of op units    included in minimum rents were rents attributable to the accounting practice of straight lining of rents 
the amount of straight lining of rents that impacted minimum rents was  for  for and  for pro forma 
inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company or the predecessor because of a relatively low inflation rate 
substantially all the leases at the centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term 
these rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on increases in the consumer price index 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years  which enables the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
additionally  most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses 
this reduces the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
new pronouncements issued none
