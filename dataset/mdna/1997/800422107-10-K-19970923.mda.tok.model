item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the statements contained in the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements  which are generally followed and therefore identified by a cross reference to factors that may affect future results  represent the company s present expectations or beliefs concerning future events 
the company cautions that such statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including the factors described below under factors that may affect future results 
results actually achieved thus may differ materially from expected results included in these statements 
general the company s business is seasonal 
demand for peanut and other nut products is highest during the months of october  november and december 
peanuts  pecans  walnuts  almonds and cashews  the company s principal raw materials  are purchased primarily during the period from august to february and are processed throughout the year 
as a result of this seasonality  the company s personnel and working capital requirements peak during the last four months of the calendar year 
also  due primarily to the seasonal nature of the company s business  the company maintains significant inventories of peanuts  pecans  walnuts  almonds and other nuts at certain times of the calendar year  especially during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year 
fluctuations in the market prices of such nuts may affect the value of the company s inventory and thus the company s profitability 
during the transition period  the company has not been adversely affected by market fluctuations 
however  declines in the market prices for pecans and the resulting reduction in the company s selling price for pecans negatively affected the company s gross profit and gross profit margin generally for the year ended december  and required the company to record a million charge in the third quarter of to write down the carrying value of its pecan inventory to the lower of cost or market value of such inventory as of september  see results of operations compared to gross profit 
the company was also required to write down the value of its peanut inventory during the third quarter of due to market conditions 
see results of operations compared to gross profit 
there can be no assurance that future write downs of the company s inventory may not be required from time to time because of market price fluctuations  competitive pricing pressures  the effects of various laws or regulations or other factors 
see factors that may affect future results availability of raw materials and market price fluctuations 
at june   the company s inventories totalled approximately million compared to approximately million at june   and million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
inventory levels at june  were lower than inventories at june  due primarily to reductions in the company s total pounds of inshell pecans on hand 
the company began operations at its new pecan shelling facility in early  and processing during the first quarter of was affected by normal start up inefficiencies 
consequently  the level of inshell pecan inventories at both june  and december  were abnormally high 
a million inventory write down was recorded in the third quarter of to reflect significant declines in the market price for pecans 
see factors that may affect future results availability of raw materials and market price fluctuations 
in order to enhance consumer awareness of dietary issues associated with the consumption of peanuts and other nut products  the company has taken steps to educate the consumer about the benefits of nut consumption 
the company has no experience or data that indicates that the growth in the number of health conscious consumers will cause a decline in nut consumption 
also  recently there has been some publicity concerning allergic reactions to peanuts and other nuts 
however  the company has no experience or data that indicates the peanut and other nut related allergies have affected or will affect the company s business

increases in the floating interest rate applicable to borrowings under the working capital revolving loan component of the company s prior bank credit facility also contributed to the increase in interest expense 
the floating rate increased as a result of increases generally in market rates of interest such as libor and the prime rate on which such interest rate is based  and an increase in the interest rate applicable to the working capital revolving loan component of the company s prior bank credit facility resulting from certain amendments to the company s prior bank credit facility in september of income taxes

the company has not made any stock repurchases since capital resources as of june   the company had approximately million of available credit under the bank credit facility 
the company believes that cash flow from operating activities and funds available under the bank credit facility will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
see factors that may affect future results growth initiatives 
factors that may affect future results a growth initiatives over the past five years  the company has substantially increased its shelling  processing and manufacturing capacity through a combination of strategic acquisitions and improvements and expansions of its facilities 
the company increased its borrowings to finance these acquisitions  improvements and expansions 
the company s growth initiatives also increased the cost of operations and increased investments in inventory related to the resulting increased production capacity 
underutilization of its increased production capacity has had a negative impact on the company s gross profit and gross profit margin 
until such time as the company is able to more fully utilize its increased production capacity through further increases in its sales volume  the company s results of operations may continue to be adversely affected 
furthermore  although the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds available under its credit facilities assuming the company maintains compliance with its covenants under its financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal  there can be no assurance that such cash flow and credit availability will be sufficient to meet future capital requirements or that the company will remain in compliance with such covenants 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the company strives to update and improve its management information systems to ensure their adequacy 
although the company believes that its management information systems currently provide the company with the information necessary to manage its business  there can be no assurance that the company s management information systems will meet the company s future requirements 
b availability of raw materials and market price fluctuations the availability and cost of raw materials for the production of the company s products  including peanuts  pecans  other nuts  dried fruit and chocolate  are subject to crop size and yield fluctuations caused by factors beyond the company s control  such as weather condition and plant diseases 
additionally  the supply of edible nuts and other raw materials used in the company s products could be reduced upon a determination by the united states department of agriculture or other government agency that certain pesticides  herbicides or other chemicals used by growers have left harmful residues on portions of the crop or that the crop has been contaminated by aflatoxin or other agents 
shortages in the supply of and resulting increases in the prices of nuts and other raw materials used by the company in its products could have an adverse impact on the company s profitability 
furthermore  fluctuations in the market prices of nuts  dried fruit or chocolate may affect the value of the company s inventory and the company s profitability 
for example  during the third quarter of the company was required to record a million charge against its earnings to reflect the impact of a lower cost or market adjustment of its pecan inventory 
the company has a significant inventory of nuts  dried fruit and chocolate that would be adversely affected by any decrease in the market price of such raw materials 
see general 
c competitive environment the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
the company s principal products compete against food and snack products manufactured and sold by numerous regional and national companies  some of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than jbss  such as planters livesavers company a subsidiary of rjr nabisco  inc 
jbss also competes with other shellers in the industrial market and with regional processors in the retail and wholesale markets 
in order to maintain or increase its market share  the company must continue to price its products competitively  which may lower revenue per unit and cause declines in gross margin  if the company is unable to increase unit volumes as well as reduce its costs 
d sales to industrial customers the increase in the company s processing and shelling capacity created by its facility construction and expansion programs over the past four years and increased sales by sunshine may result in further increases in net sales to industrial customers  both in amount and as a percentage of the company s total sales 
because sales to industrial customers are generally made at lower margins than sales to other customers  increases in such sales may adversely affect the company s profit margins 
e fixed price commitments from time to time  the company enters into fixed price commitments with its customers 
such commitments typically represent or less of the company s annual net sales and are normally entered into after the company s cost to acquire the nut products necessary to satisfy the fixed price commitment is substantially fixed 
the company plans to continue entering into fixed price commitments in respect to certain of its nut products prior to fixing its acquisition cost when  in management s judgment  market or crop harvest conditions so warrant 
to the extent the company does so  these fixed price commitments may result in losses 
historically  however  such losses have generally been offset by gains on other fixed price commitments 
however  there can be no assurance that losses from fixed price commitments may not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
f federal regulation of peanut prices  quotas and poundage allotments peanuts are an important part of the company s product line 
the company processed approximately million pounds of peanuts during the transition period  which represents approximately of the total pounds of products processed by the company for the period 
the production and marketing of peanuts are regulated by the usda under the agricultural adjustment act of the agricultural adjustment act 
the agricultural adjustment act  and regulations promulgated thereunder  support the peanut crop by i limiting peanut imports  ii limiting the amount of peanuts that american farmers are allowed to take to the domestic market each year  and iii setting a minimum price that a sheller must pay for peanuts which may be sold for domestic consumption 
the amount of peanuts that american farmers can sell each year is determined by the secretary of agriculture and is based upon the prior year s peanut consumption in the united states 
only peanuts that qualify under the quota may be sold for domestic food products and seed 
the peanut quota for the calendar year is  million tons 
peanuts in excess of the quota are called additional peanuts and generally may only be exported or used domestically for crushing into oil or meal 
current regulations permit additional peanuts to be domestically processed and exported as finished goods to any foreign country 
the quota support price for the calendar year is per ton 
the farm bill extended the federal support and subsidy program for peanuts for seven years 
however  there are no assurances that congress will not change or eliminate the program prior to its scheduled expiration 
changes in the federal peanut program could significantly affect the supply of  and price for  peanuts 
while jbss has successfully operated in a market shaped by the federal peanut program for many years  jbss believes that it could adapt to a market without federal regulation if that were to become necessary 
however  jbss has no experience in operating in such a peanut market  and no assurances can be given that the elimination or modification of the federal peanut program would not adversely affect jbss s business 
future changes in import quota limitations or the quota support price for peanuts at a time when the company is maintaining a significant inventory of peanuts or has significant outstanding purchase commitments could adversely affect the company s business by lowering the market value of the peanuts in its inventory or the peanuts which it is committed to buy 
while the company believes that its ability to use its raw peanut inventories in its own processing operations gives it greater protection against these changes than is possessed by certain competitors whose operations are limited to either shelling or processing  no assurances can be given that future changes in  or the elimination of  the federal peanut program or import quotas will not adversely affect the company s business 
the north american free trade agreement nafta  effective january   committed the united states  mexico and canada to the elimination of quantitative restrictions and tariffs on the cross border movement of industrial and agricultural products 
under nafta  united states import restrictions on mexican shelled and inshell peanuts are replaced by a tariff rate quota  initially set at  tons  which will increase by a compound rate each year until shipments within the quota s parameters enter the us duty free  while imports above quota parameters from mexico face tariff rates equivalent to approximately on shelled and on inshell peanuts 
the tariffs will be phased out gradually by the uruguay round agreement of the general agreement on trade and tariffs gatt took effect on july  under gatt  the united states must allow peanut imports to grow to of domestic consumption by import quotas on peanuts have been replaced by high ad valorem tariffs  which must be reduced by annually for each of the next six years 
also under gatt  the united states may limit imports of peanut butter  but must establish a tariff rate quota for peanut butter imports based on import levels 
peanut butter imports above the quota will be subject to an over quota ad valorem tariff  which also will be reduced by annually for each of the next six years 
although nafta and gatt do not directly affect the federal peanut program  the federal government may  in future legislative initiatives  reconsider the federal peanut program in light of these agreements 
the company does not believe that nafta and gatt have had a material impact on the company s business or will have a material impact on the company s business in the near term
