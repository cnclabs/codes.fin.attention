the company has since expanded its operations to provide its products to grocery and club stores throughout the united states 
the company s overall strategic plan is to enhance the value of the monterey pasta company brand name by distributing its gourmet pasta products through multiple channels of distribution 
the company s distribution of pasta and pasta sauces to grocery and club stores increased from approximately stores as of december  to approximately  in december  and declined to approximately  as of december  the company plans to continue significant expansion of its distribution to grocery and club stores in its current market area and to further its penetration in other geographic regions of the us during  and  significant costs were incurred to promote this expansion including product demonstration  advertising  warehousing  and distribution costs and the hiring of additional personnel

the company sold its restaurant subsidiary to an affiliate of mr 
lance mortensen  a former chief executive officer and director of the company 
the success of the company depends on a number of factors including whether grocery and club store chains will continue to expand the number of their stores offering the company s products and whether the company can continue to increase the number of grocery and club store chains offering its products 
grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s products will continue to do so in the future 
the company believes that access to substantially greater capital resources  coupled with continued reduction of its administrative and production costs  will be key requirements in the company s efforts to enhance its competitive position and increase its market penetration 
in order to support its expansion program  the company has developed  and is continuing to develop new products for the consumers and revised advertising and promotional activities for its retail grocery and club store accounts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its net revenues from grocery and club stores 
because the company will continue to make expenditures associated with the expansion of its business  the company s results of operations may be affected 
continuing operations for  and net revenues from continuing operations were   and  for  and  respectively  reflecting annual increases in sales of for when compared to and for when compared to these increases are the result of increased distribution on a per store basis to approximately  individual grocery and club stores by year end of compared to approximately  and  for and  respectively 
gross margins decreased from in to in  in large part due to the attempted penetration of the east coast and southern california markets during the first three quarters of although the company was successful in increasing its overall sales figures by adding customers in these areas  the terms given to the new customers were often at severely reduced margins 
beginning in late and early  the company has since discontinued relationships with or renegotiated terms with the bulk of those customers accounting for the reduced margins  thereby beginning a reversal of the negative gross margin trend 
margins increased from in to in  due to the positive impact created by significantly increased sales  reducing previously under utilized capacity 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in these expenses totaled  in and  in  reflecting a growth of  or from to included in s increased spending is over million specifically for sales and marketing including incremental headcount and promotional expenses deemed necessary to expand the business base 
the increases were also attributable to expansion of the company s infrastructure  including increased administrative and management salaries  recruiting and training  and facilities costs 
additionally  selling costs were high as a result of the company s efforts to obtain new customers and enter new geographic markets 
this trend is expected to be reversed in as a result of redefined marketing focus  reduced headcounts and related overhead expenses implemented in late and early depreciation and amortization expense  included in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses  increased to  or of net revenues in  compared to  or of net revenues in and  or in these increases relate primarily to capital expenditures in the monterey county production facility 
the company anticipates further increases in depreciation and amortization in future periods as additional equipment is purchased and placed into service

the total losses from discontinued operations also included provisions covering losses prior to sale of ufo  accruals related to discontinued operations  and provisions to reduce the net assets from discontinued operations to their net realizable value 
the losses were charged directly to the resulting reserves  as were actual expenditures related to the restaurant and franchising operations 
during  the reserves were also reduced by  to reflect adjustments of estimates to the actual company expenditures 
remaining reserves of  are expected to be utilized during as the company finalizes all arrangements winding up its involvement in the discontinued operations 
impact of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its operations to date 
substantial increases in labor  employee benefits  freight  energy  ingredients and packaging  rents and other operating expenses could adversely affect the operations of the company s business in future periods 
management cannot predict whether such increases will occur in the future 
liquidity and capital resources during the twelve month period ended december    of cash was used in the company s operations  compared to  used in  related to the operating losses from continuing operations and expenditures related to discontinued operations 
in october  the company entered into a note purchase agreement with an existing institutional shareholder

while there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the company s initiatives  management believes these changes in its business  as discussed above  will allow the company to enhance its financial position and operating results 
management believes that the recently concluded private placement funding and cash generated from continuing operations will provide adequate funding to meet its needs through mid however  as a result of the company s desire to significantly expand and develop its customer base and distribution network  the company is evaluating additional financing opportunities to support such expansion 
sales and marketing as part of the company s efforts to build national brand recognition and loyalty  the company introduced new product labels and promotional materials in however  reserves and accruals against trade receivables totaling  at december  include estimated product returns  spoilage  customer allowances and adjustments  and bad debts 
as a part of the company s plans to return to profitability  the company has withdrawn from the food service  kiosk  and military markets 
as a result  the company took a writedown of  in for manufacturing equipment and vendor carts directly associated with these activities 
in addition  a  writedown to estimated fair value was taken in for certain plant equipment replaced when the company updated its production lines  as well as certain excess or overvalued office equipment 
in  the company expended substantial resources on slotting allowances and other incentives in order to attract new customers 
the company re evaluated the effectiveness of these expenditures and wrote off  for slotting allowances which were determined to be non recoverable and of no future benefit see below 
further  as part of the company s strategic refocusing  the company has re evaluated its advertising and marketing strategy 
as previously disclosed in prior company s forms k and q  the company s strategy contained risks associated with expenditures related to attempts to increase market share and attract new customers 
based on an evaluation of the potential benefits from significant media advertising campaigns  the company has decided to withdraw its current media advertising efforts and forego additional media advertising expenditures 
as a result  during the company wrote off related  non recoverable prepaid advertising and advertising production expenses totaling  the company has also accrued for future commitments for which there are contractual obligations 
as part of this change in strategy  the company significantly reduced the staffing of its marketing department subsequent to the third quarter of since october  the sales staff has reported directly to the ceo and has consisted of regional sales personnel and support staff  focusing on the retail and club store markets  together with the direct store delivery dsd group  supporting current dsd customers 
in addition  the company will continue to support its sales efforts to the club stores  through the continued use of in store demonstration programs 
in march  the company discontinued the dsd program  converting the largest portion safeway retail locations to warehouse delivery 
the company is in negotiations with a distribution group formed by an ex employee to service the other dsd customers 
this arrangement will be an asset sale  primarily delivery vehicles and inventory  and will provide favorable credit terms for the first days 
the target date for completing the transaction is mid april 
the company successfully began implementation of an overall price increase to the retail grocery trade starting october cost reductions the company significantly reduced its total corporate and plant administrative headcount and costs on a going forward basis as part of the plan adopted in the fourth quarter of to return to profitable operations and optimize financial performance 
in january  the company relocated its corporate headquarters from san francisco  california to its manufacturing facility in salinas  california 
this move is expected to result in a substantial reduction of future corporate and overhead costs  beginning in the second quarter of in addition  the company significantly reduced the scope of its advertising and media campaigns 
the company will continue with those promotional activities  such as in store demonstrations  that it considers effective and consistent with its ongoing sales objectives 
in this light  the company s slotting fees from club stores and grocery chains for shelf space allocations  for example  declined significantly starting in the fourth quarter of consistent with these cost reduction initiatives  the company has invested million in machinery and equipment and leasehold improvements in retooling its salinas production facilities to increase operating efficiencies as well as shelf life of its products 
in a complementary move  the company announced a uniform overall retail grocery price increase and in some cases revised its trade allowance and product return policies to those accounts with insufficient profit margins commencing in the fourth quarter of although the company was generally successful in revising its sales agreements with specific customers  it voluntarily discontinued the supply of products to selected retail grocery accounts 
settlements with former employees the company had outstanding employment related disputes with a number of employees 
total settlement costs are included either in the reserves for discontinued operations or in continuing operations as appropriate 
major customers two of the company s retail customers  price costco and safeway  accounted for and respectively of the company s sales for the twelve months ended december  no other customer accounted for greater than of net revenues for the period 
business risks certain characteristics and dynamics of the company s business and of financial markets generally create risks to the company s long term success and to predictable quarterly results 
these risks include recent operating losses no assurance of profitability the company s profitability began to decline in in the second quarter of  the company reported its first operating loss from continuing operations 
the company reported additional operating losses from continuing operations in eight of ten quarters since then 
the company s operating loss for the quarter ended december was  at december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  there can be no assurance that the company will return to profitability in the short term or ever 
liquidity  need for additional capital 
management believes that it will have sufficient resources to provide adequate liquidity to meet the company s planned capital and operating requirements through mid thereafter  the company s operations will need to be funded either with funds generated through operations or with additional debt or equity financing 
if the company s operations do not provide funds sufficient to fund its operations and the company seeks outside financing  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing when needed  on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  any future equity financing or convertible debt financing would cause the company s shareholders to incur dilution in net tangible book value per share of common stock 
hiring and retention of key personnel  management transition 
the success of the company depends on the efforts of key management personnel 
in the fourth quarter of  a number of corporate officers left the company 
these included its president and chief executive officer  executive vice president and vice president legal affairs  who resigned on october  together with three additional board members  and its chief financial officer  who resigned on november  in addition  the interim president appointed in december resigned in march the company currently has a chief executive officer and a new chief financial officer  neither of whom has previously been a part of the company s management team  and both of whom may not continue in their current positions on a long term basis 
the board of directors began a search for a new chief executive officer in the first quarter of the company s success will depend on its ability to operate under new management  to attract qualified candidates  to effect a smooth transition to new management with minimal disruption in operations  and to motivate and retain key employees and officers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effect smooth transitions from its management team to a new management team  that new officers will be hired or if hired will be able to perform effectively  or that significant management turnover will not continue in the future 
at december   there are no keyman insurance policies in place 
impact of inflation 
the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its operations to date 
substantial increases in labor  employee benefits  freight  energy  ingredients and packaging  rents and other operating expenses could adversely affect the operations of the company s business in future periods 
the company cannot predict whether such increases will occur in the future 
volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated substantially since the initial public offering of the common stock in december such volatility may  in part  be attributable to the company s operating results or to changes in the direction of the company s expansion efforts 
in addition  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets or the food industry  natural disasters or other developments affecting the company or its competitors could cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies  including the company  for reasons sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
any shortfall in the company s net sales or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts or the market could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
risks inherent in food production 
the company faces all of the risks inherent in the production and distribution of refrigerated food products  including contamination  adulteration and spoilage  and the associated risks of product liability litigation and declines in the price of its stock may be associated with even an isolated event 
the company has a modern production facility  employs what it believes is state of the art thermal processing  temperature controlled storage  haacp programs intended to insure food safety  and has obtained usda approval for its production plant 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s procedures will be adequate to prevent the occurrence of such events 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s grocery and club store accounts are expected to experience seasonal fluctuations to some extent 
the company s business in general may also be affected by a variety of other factors  including but not limited to general economic trends  competition  marketing programs  and special or unusual events 
competition and dependence on common carriers the company s business continues to be dominated by several very large competitors which have significantly greater resources than the company  such competitors can outspend the company and negatively affect the company s market share and results of operations 
the company also continues to be dependent on common carriers to distribute its products 
any disruption in the company s distribution system or increase in the costs thereof could have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
marketing and sales risks the future success of the company s efforts will depend on a number of factors  including whether grocery and club store chains will continue to expand the number of their individual stores offering the company s products and whether allowances and other incentives will expand retail distribution 
expansion into new markets increases the risk of significant product returns resulting from the company s supply of slower selling items to its customers 
in addition  grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s products will continue to do so in the future 
should these channels choose to reduce or eliminate products  the company could experience a significant reduction in its product sales 
as indicated previously  the company remains dependent on the use of slotting allowances and other incentives to expand retail distribution 
in order to reduce risk  the company has significantly reduced expansion into new markets requiring such major expenditures 
furthermore  the improvement in profitability resulting from the company s overall retail grocery price increase and revision of its trade allowance and product return policies to previously low margin customers is contingent on the degree of ongoing acceptance of these changes
