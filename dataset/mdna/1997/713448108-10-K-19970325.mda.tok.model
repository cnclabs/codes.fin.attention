item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations  cash flows and financial condition management s analysis introduction management s analysis is presented in four sections 
the first section provides introductory comments  highlights items that significantly impact comparability of reported financial information and provides some perspective of our operations outside of the united states pages 
the second section analyzes the results of operations  first on a consolidated basis and then for each of our three industry segments pages 
the final two sections address our consolidated cash flows and financial condition  which also includes our cautionary statements pages as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we had a two for one stock split in all share data in management s analysis have been adjusted to reflect the stock split 
change in segment reporting beginning in the fourth quarter of  we changed the segment reporting which supports our management s analysis to more closely reflect how we manage the business 
as a result  our beverages and snack foods segments are now reported on a north american basis us and canada combined and an international basis all other international while the restaurants segment continues to be reported on a us and international basis 
also  the net sales and operating profit we report externally now generally match the net sales and operating profit our operating units report to our senior management 
the operating profit reported on this management basis does not reflect items the operating units are not held accountable for  such as the million initial impact of adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  in see note 
it also does not reflect insignificant allocations for corporate items directly attributable to the segments or exclude results from unconsolidated affiliates  both of which are required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise 
the management basis operating profit page includes a reconciliation to the operating profit disclosure required by sfas  which is provided in note prior year amounts and related management s analysis have been restated 
certain factors affecting comparability the following table summarizes items impacting comparability  which are described in notes  and we believe the items included in the first section are so unusual and distortive that we do not include them when we evaluate the ongoing performances of our businesses

the decline in reflected an operating loss in international beverages compared to an operating profit in the growth in was slowed by mexico  formerly our largest international market  where the mexican peso devalued approximately in late and early consumer demand declined dramatically in response to declining real incomes  increased unemployment and price increases taken to offset rising costs 
our efforts to stimulate demand  reduce costs and reduce capital spending resulted in only a modest decline in peso operating profit 
however  on a us dollar basis  sales  income and identifiable assets in mexico declined dramatically  reflecting the unfavorable translation effect of the much weaker peso  as summarized below in millions except per share amounts decline net sales   net income net income per share identifiable assets results of operations volume is defined as the estimated effect on net sales and operating profit of the year over year change in company owned bottler case sales and concentrate unit sales in beverages  pound or kilo sales in snack foods and transaction counts in restaurants 
consolidated review net sales growth rates in millions net sales    worldwide net sales rose billion in reflecting higher effective net pricing including the effect of product  package and country mix in each of our three business segments and net volume gains of million 
the higher effective net pricing was partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact  primarily reflecting the weaker peso and the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the japanese yen 
the volume gains were driven by worldwide snack foods and north american beverages  partially offset by declines at us restaurants 
the sales growth rate was reduced by point as we reduced our ownership of the restaurant system through refranchising and closing underperforming restaurants  as described in management s analysis restaurants beginning on page worldwide net sales rose billion or in the fifty third week in reduced worldwide net sales growth by approximately points 
the growth benefited from higher effective net pricing in international snack foods  driven by mexico  and in north american beverages  primarily to help offset higher prices for packaging 
these benefits were partially offset by the unfavorable currency translation impact of the weaker peso on international snack foods 
volume gains in worldwide snack foods and beverages added million to net sales 
additional restaurant units contributed million to sales growth 
cost of sales in millions cost of sales    as a percent of net sales cost of sales as a percent of net sales decreased 
of a point in primarily due to lower raw materials costs in north american beverages coupled with the leveraging effect of the higher effective net pricing 
the 
of a point increase in cost of sales as a percent of net sales in was primarily due to higher packaging prices in north american beverages  the effect of which was partially mitigated by increased effective net pricing  and an unfavorable mix shift in international beverages sales from higher margin concentrate to lower margin packaged products 
cost of sales as a percent of net sales in international snack foods increased due to inflation driven cost increases in mexico  which were partially mitigated by price increases

losses from our unconsolidated affiliates  compared to earnings a year ago  primarily reflected our share of operating losses from buenos aires embotelladora sa baesa 
baesa is one of our bottling joint ventures in latin america 
in  sg a grew due to a m  s d and g a all growing at a slower rate than sales 
the slower spending was driven by worldwide beverages and us restaurants 
g a in worldwide beverages benefited from international cost containment initiatives  savings in north american beverages from a reorganization and leverage from the increased effective net pricing in north american beverages 
other income benefited from net refranchising gains of million  compared to store closure costs of million in and a gain on the sale of an international bottling plant in amortization of intangible assets declined in to million as a result of the reduced carrying amount of intangible assets in connection with the adoption of sfas see note  but increased to million in this noncash expense reduced net income per share by in and in unusual impairment  disposal and other charges of million million after tax or per share in were associated with international beverages million and the decision to dispose of our non core us restaurant businesses million

these advances were partially offset by net unfavorable currency translation impacts  primarily related to the peso 
the benefit of higher effective net pricing for all segments combined was almost entirely offset by increased product and operating costs  primarily in mexico  and higher packaging prices in north american beverages 
ongoing operating profit growth benefited from reduced net corporate costs

our reported effective tax rate increased points to  driven by the low tax benefits associated with the unusual impairment  disposal and other charges

our reported effective tax rate increased point to 
our ongoing effective tax rate declined slightly  reflecting benefits from the current year resolution of certain prior years audit issues 
these benefits were partially offset by a higher foreign effective tax rate  primarily due to a provision in us tax legislation and a decrease in the proportion of income taxed at lower foreign rates

system bottler case sales bcs of pepsi corporate brands is our standard volume measure 
it represents company owned brands as well as brands we have the right to produce  distribute and market nationally  and includes sales of packaged products and fountain syrup by company owned and franchised bottlers 
bcs was not impacted by the fifty third week in because it is measured on a calendar year basis 
vs 
north america sales in north america rose million 
the gain reflected volume growth of million  led by carbonated soft drink csd products  and higher effective net pricing 
north american bcs increased  with solid increases in brand pepsi and the mountain dew brand 
alternative beverages  led by aquafina bottled water and hawaiian punch fountain syrup  grew at a double digit rate 
profit in north america increased million 
the growth reflected volume gains of million  lower product costs and the higher effective net pricing 
advertising and marketing expenses grew significantly faster than sales  primarily due to the pepsi stuff promotion 
selling and distribution expense grew at the same rate as sales and volume 
profit growth was aided by lapping charges taken in  primarily for losses on supply contracts  take or pay co packing penalties and a write down of excess co packing assets 
a gain on the sale of an investment in a bottling cooperative and a settlement with a supplier for purchases made in prior years also helped profit growth 
benefits of approximately million related to the us restructuring were achieved in due to the centralization of purchasing and improved administrative and business processes 
benefits are expected to grow until fully realized in  when they are expected to be about million annually 
all benefits from the restructuring will continue to be reinvested in the business to strengthen our competitive position 
international our new strategy for international beverages is to focus on building our core business in markets in which we are already strong and in emerging markets where we believe the competitive playing field is essentially level 
as a result  we took a restructuring charge of million  which is described in note almost all of the charge is expected to be paid by the end of the restructuring is expected to generate about million in savings in  and about million a year thereafter 
see cautionary statements beginning on page in addition  a largely noncash charge of million was recognized in related to the impairment of certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates million  concentrate related assets million  assets not related to the core international beverage business million and our share of the unusual charges recorded by baesa for restructuring actions and noncash accounting charges million 
international sales declined million  primarily due to unfavorable currency translation impacts and lower volume of million 
the volume decline reflected lower concentrate shipments to franchisees  partially offset by higher packaged product sales to retailers 
international bcs decreased 
excluding the fourth quarter impact of the unexpected loss of our venezuelan bottler in august  bcs declined 
a single digit decline in latin america was partially offset by strong double digit growth in china and india 
international beverages reported operating losses of million or a decline of million 
excluding the unusual charges  international beverages reported an ongoing operating loss of million or a decline of million 
the ongoing operating loss reflected broad based increases in advertising and marketing expenses  higher than normal expenses from fourth quarter balance sheet adjustments and actions  increased net losses from our unconsolidated affiliates and a volume decline of million 
the increased net losses from our unconsolidated affiliates was driven by our equity share of baesa s operating losses 
vs 
north america sales in north america rose million or 
the fifty third week in reduced the sales growth by approximately points 
the sales growth reflected higher effective net pricing on most csd packages  primarily in response to significantly higher packaging prices 
sales growth also benefited from increased volume  which contributed million 
north american bcs increased  reflecting double digit growth in the mountain dew brand  solid increases in brand pepsi and strong double digit growth in alternative beverages  led by lipton brand tea and the all sport brand 
north american profit increased million or 
the fifty third week in reduced the operating profit growth by approximately points 
profit growth reflected the higher effective net pricing on csd packages and concentrate which exceeded the increased packaging costs 
volume gains  driven by packaged products  contributed million million excluding the impact of the fifty third week to the profit growth 
administrative expenses declined  reflecting savings from a consolidation of headquarters and field operations in the us selling and distribution expenses declined as a percentage of sales  in part reflecting higher pricing 
advertising and marketing expenses decreased  reflecting a reallocation of funds to support promotional discounts in the fountain channel  which is classified as a reduction of sales 
in the aggregate  advertising and marketing expenses and fountain discounts was about even with the prior year 
in  north america continued to execute actions related to the us restructuring 
benefits in were offset by incremental costs associated with the continued development and implementation of the restructuring 
net benefits of approximately million were expected to begin to be realized in and to increase annually until fully realized in international international sales rose million or 
the fifty third week in reduced the sales growth by approximately point 
start up operations  principally in eastern europe  and net acquisitions  primarily of bottling operations in asia  together contributed points to the sales growth 
sales growth also benefited from volume advances of million and higher effective net pricing 
international bcs grew 
this advance reflected broad based growth partially offset by declines in mexico  our largest international bcs market  and argentina  both of which had adverse economic conditions 
international beverages reported a profit decrease of million or 
ongoing operating profit declined million or 
the fifty third week in reduced the ongoing operating profit decline by approximately points 
the slight decline in ongoing operating profit primarily reflected significantly weaker results in mexico discussed below 
excluding mexico  ongoing operating profit increased million or  reflecting increased volume  primarily concentrate  of million and the higher effective net pricing  partially offset by higher field operating costs and increased headquarters expenses 
profit was also aided by a gain on the sale of a bottling plant 
as discussed in management s analysis international businesses on page  results in mexico were adversely impacted by economic difficulties resulting from the significant devaluation of the peso

discussions include the impact of the fifty third week in see notes and  while pound or kilo growth have been adjusted to exclude its impact 
vs 
north america sales in north america grew million 
the sales increase reflected strong volume growth of million and higher effective net pricing across all core brands in late and late volume grew in almost all core brands with low fat and no fat snacks accounting for over of the sales growth 
pound volume in north america advanced  reflecting exceptional performance from the low fat and no fat categories 
these categories contributed over of the total pound growth  led by baked lay s brand potato crisps 
core brands  excluding their low fat and no fat versions  had mid single digit growth led by double digit growth in lay s brand potato chips and strong double digit growth in tostitos brand tortilla chips 
profit in north america grew million 
the profit increase reflected the volume growth  which contributed million  and the higher effective net pricing  which exceeded increased promotional price allowances and merchandising support 
the growth rate of promotional price allowances moderated in the fourth quarter 
these gains were partially offset by higher operating and manufacturing costs and increased administrative expenses 
the increased operating costs reflected increased selling and distribution and advertising expenses 
selling and distribution expenses and manufacturing costs both reflected higher capacity costs and some inefficiencies incurred to capture the volume opportunities created when anheuser busch exited the salty snack food business 
these inefficiencies began to moderate in the fourth quarter 
operating expenses grew faster than sales for the year 
the increase in operating expenses coupled with higher administrative expenses  partially reflected investment spending to sustain strong volume growth 
this increased investment spending  including costs of developing and testing new products  was partially offset by a gain on the sale of a non core business 
international international sales increased million 
the sales increase reflected inflation based pricing increases in mexico and volume growth of million  partially offset by an unfavorable currency translation impact  led by the peso 
international kilo growth is reported on a systemwide basis  which includes both consolidated businesses and unconsolidated affiliates operating for at least one year 
salty snack kilos rose  reflecting double digit growth at sabritas in mexico and strong single digit growth by walkers in the uk  our two largest salty snack businesses 
sweet snack kilos declined  led by a single digit decline at gamesa in mexico  due to market wide contraction and a double digit decline at alegro  the sweet snack division of sabritas 
international operating profit increased million 
the increase reflected higher effective net pricing in advance of inflation driven product and operating cost increases  primarily in mexico  and the increased volumes of million 
these gains were partially offset by increased administrative expenses and the net unfavorable currency translation impact 
advertising and marketing expenses increased  partially reflecting investment in global advertising and design 
beginning in  we will categorize mexico as highly inflationary and  therefore  the us dollar will be the functional currency 
although difficult to estimate  we expect the reported results of our sabritas and gamesa operations to be slightly lower than what they would have been had we retained the peso as our functional currency

profit in north america grew million or 
the fifty third week in reduced the profit growth by approximately points 
the profit increase reflected strong volume growth  which contributed million million excluding the impact of the fifty third week  and higher pricing that exceeded increased promotional price allowances and merchandising support 
this growth was partially offset by increased operating costs  driven by higher selling  distribution and administrative expenses and increased marketing investment to promote strong volume momentum 
selling and distribution expenses grew at about the same rate as sales  while advertising and marketing costs grew slower than sales 
the higher administrative expenses reflected investment spending to maintain volume growth  including new manufacturing and delivery systems 
the profit growth was also hampered by higher manufacturing costs  reflecting increased capacity costs and an unfavorable sales mix shift to lower margin value oriented packages 
international as discussed in management s analysis international businesses on page  results in mexico were adversely impacted by economic difficulties resulting from the significant devaluation of the peso 
this effect was particularly dramatic on international snack foods results as mexico represented almost of its operating profit 
net sales in mexico declined in  while operating profit declined million or to million 
as a result  mexico represented about half of international snack foods profit 
since the change in results of mexico had such a distortive effect on international results  the following net sales and operating profit discussions exclude the effects of mexico where noted 
international sales decreased million or 
excluding mexico  sales grew more than  the fifty third week in reduced the sales growth by approximately points 
this growth reflected increased volumes of million  a favorable mix shift to higher priced packages and products and acquisitions  which contributed million 
salty snack kilos rose  reflecting strong double digit volume growth in brazil  the uk and our joint ventures in the netherlands and spain 
sweet snack kilos grew  led by a double digit advance at gamesa 
international operating profit decreased million 
the fifty third week in had no effect on operating profit 
the principal cause of the decrease in operating profit was the economic difficulties in mexico 
excluding mexico  operating profit increased million or

profit growth reflected the favorable mix shift to higher priced packages and products and increased volumes of million  partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and increased administrative expenses 
restaurants an update to our restaurant strategy is provided to set the context of the operating results discussion beginning on page strategy update in january  we announced that we would pursue a plan to spin off our core restaurant businesses to our shareholders as an independent publicly traded company 
the new company will include both the us and international operations of pizza hut  taco bell and kfc 
we are exploring the possibility of selling pepsico food systems pfs  our restaurant distribution operation 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a million charge related to a decision to dispose of hot n now hnn 
in the fourth quarter  we recognized an impairment loss of million as a result of our decision to sell our remaining non core us restaurant businesses which include california pizza kitchen cpk  chevys  d angelo sandwich shops d angelo and east side mario s esm 
we reduced our investments in these businesses to estimated fair market value  less costs to sell 
estimated fair market value was based primarily upon the opinion of an investment banking firm 
see notes and and cautionary statements beginning on page in addition  we will continue to execute the strategy we initiated two years ago to reduce our percentage ownership in our restaurant businesses by selling company operated restaurants to franchisees refranchising and closing underperforming units 
although this refranchising strategy reduces reported sales  it improves restaurants returns and profit by eliminating capital investment in stores while generating a franchise royalty revenue stream which  in some cases  exceeds the profit we had earned from the stores prior to refranchising 
in addition  margins benefit from the closing of underperforming stores in the company operated portfolio 
operating profit and cash flows benefit from the one time refranchising gains including initial franchise fees 
our restaurant companies have usually remained contingently liable for restaurant leases assigned as part of the refranchising activity  however  we believe any risk of loss under these assignments would not be material

vs 
us net sales decreased million 
the decrease was driven by volume declines of million  partially due to lapping the second quarter introduction of stuffed crust pizza  and the unfavorable impact of fewer company units of million 
these declines were partially offset by higher effective net pricing and the consolidation of cpk at the end of the second quarter of same store sales decreased and at pizza hut and taco bell  respectively  reflecting fewer transaction counts 
kfc s same store sales increased due primarily to the impact of new products such as tender roast chicken  colonel s crispy strips and chunky chicken pot pies

ongoing operating profit decreased million because of higher store operating costs  a volume decrease of million and recurring noncash sfas impairment charges of million 
the higher store operating costs reflected increased labor and food costs  partially offset by reduced depreciation and amortization expense of million in connection with the adoption of sfas the above effects were partially offset by the higher effective net pricing which exceeded the increased store operating costs  and by a net refranchising gain of million in compared to million in international international sales increased million  driven by the favorable impact of net additional company units of million  higher effective net pricing and increased volumes  which contributed million

our puerto rico portfolio totaled million at year end and million at year end we expect to repatriate most of the year end balance in the increase in prepaid expenses  deferred income taxes and other current assets principally reflected a reclassification of the carrying amount of our non core us restaurant long lived assets  partially offset by a significant decline in current deferred income taxes 
these non core restaurants assets are now being held for disposal and carried at estimated fair market value 
liabilities decreased million or to billion 
the decline reflected the pay down of short term debt with the funds repatriated from puerto rico  partially offset by increased accounts payable and other current liabilities  due in part to the international beverages restructuring charge 
at year end and  billion of short term borrowings were reclassified as long term  reflecting our intent and ability  through the existence of our unused revolving credit facilities  to refinance these borrowings 
our unused credit facilities  which exist largely to support the issuances of short term borrowings  were billion at year end and effective january   we extended to billion of these credit facilities 
annually  these facilities can be extended an additional year upon the mutual consent of pepsico and the lending institutions 
our strong cash generating capability and our strong financial condition give us ready access to capital markets throughout the world 
we measure financial leverage on both a market value and historical cost basis 
we believe that the most meaningful measure of debt is on a net basis  which takes into account our investment portfolios held outside the us these portfolios are managed as part of our overall financing strategy and are not required to support day to day operations 
net debt reflects the pro forma remittance of the portfolios net of related taxes as a reduction of total debt 
total debt includes the present value of operating lease commitments 
we also use market leverage to measure our long term financial leverage 
we define market leverage as net debt as a percent of net debt plus the market value of equity  based on the year end stock price 
unlike historical cost measures  the market value of equity primarily reflects the estimated net present value of expected future cash flows that will both support debt and provide returns to shareholders 
the market net debt ratio was unchanged in  largely because the increase in our year end stock price was offset by a decline in our shares outstanding 
in  the market net debt ratio declined points to due primarily to a increase in our stock price 
measured on a historical cost basis  the ratio of net debt to net capital employed defined as net debt  other liabilities  deferred income taxes and shareholders equity increased points to in  reflecting a decline in net capital employed 
the point decline to in reflected a decline in net debt and a increase in net capital employed 
graph market net debt ratio graph historical net debt ratio our negative operating working capital position  which reflects the cash sales nature of our restaurant operations partially offset by our more working capital intensive packaged goods businesses  effectively provides additional capital for investment 
operating working capital  which excludes short term investments and short term borrowings  was a negative million and negative million at year end and  respectively 
the million increase in negative working capital in primarily reflected reclassifications of a portion of other liabilities and deferred income taxes to income taxes payable and accounts payable and other current liabilities  respectively  and a decline in operating working capital in our international beverages business 
the increase was partially offset by the reclassification of our non core us restaurant long lived assets held for disposal to prepaid expenses  deferred income taxes and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the decline in international beverages reflected higher accrued liabilities due to the restructuring charge  coupled with lower receivables from a decline in sales 
shareholders equity decreased million or to billion 
this change was the result of a billion increase in treasury stock  reflecting repurchases of million shares offset by million shares used for stock option exercises 
this decrease was mitigated by a increase in retained earnings due to billion in net income less dividends declared of million 
cautionary statements from time to time  in written reports and oral statements  we discuss our expectations regarding future performance of the company 
these forward looking statements are based on currently available competitive  financial and economic data and our operating plans 
they are also inherently uncertain  and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from what we had expected 
in addition  as discussed in the management s analysis the forecasted annual savings of million in  and about million a year thereafter related to the international beverages restructuring charge page assumes that facilities are vacated and employees are terminated within the time frames used to develop the estimate 
the expectation that our reported results in mexico will be slightly lower than what they would have been had we not changed our functional currency from the peso to the us dollar page assumes that the peso will not devalue significantly in the spin off of our core restaurant businesses page is subject to receipt of a tax ruling by the internal revenue service that would allow it to be tax free to our shareholders  various regulatory approvals  appropriate stock market conditions for distribution and final approval by our board of directors 
the impairment charge recorded to reduce our investment in our non core us restaurant businesses to estimated fair market value assumed certain sales prices based primarily upon the opinion of an investment banking firm 
these estimates could vary significantly from the final sales prices page 
our ability to execute our restaurant refranchising program page depends on our ability to find investors to purchase our restaurants at prices we consider appropriate
