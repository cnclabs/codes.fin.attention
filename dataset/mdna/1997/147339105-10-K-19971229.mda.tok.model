item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following is management s assessment of the company s financial condition and a discussion of the principal factors that affect consolidated results of operations for the month period ended september   and the unaudited twelve month periods ended september   and  and cash flows for the month period ended september   the nine month transition period ended september   and the year ended december  as of september   the company adopted a fiscal year ending september previously  the fiscal year coincided with the calendar year 
the new year end is more compatible with the company s business cycle  and provides for reporting of a heating season october through march in a single fiscal year 
results of operations results of operations for the three fiscal periods were as follows months ended september thousands except per share data operating revenues    less gas purchases    revenue taxes    operating margin    cost of operations operating expenses    depreciation and amortization    property and payroll taxes    earnings from operations    nonoperating expense income interest    interest charged to construction amortization of debt issuance expense other earnings before income taxes    income taxes    net earnings    preferred dividends net earnings available to common shareholders    common shares outstanding weighted average    end of period    net earnings per common share unaudited unaudited earnings per share per share results for the months ended september  were greater than the twelve months ended september  earnings were affected primarily by operating margins 
in fiscal year earnings were reduced 
per share from gas cost increases in the state of oregon 
in fiscal year earnings were negatively affected 
per share due to a second quarter ended june  charge against income for unrecovered gas costs and valuation adjustments to non utility assets 
operating margin residential and commercial margin 
operating margins derived from sales to residential and commercial customers were as set forth in the following table 
residential and commercial operating margins dollars in thousands months ended september degree days    average number of customers residential    commercial    average therm usage per customer residential commercial    operating margin residential    commercial    fiscal operating margins from sales to residential and commercial customers were up  or over the twelve months ended september  fiscal 
factors contributing to this increase were customer growth  higher therm usage per residential customer  and new state of washington tariff rates effective august  these factors resulted in margin increases of approximately   and  respectively 
somewhat offsetting these increases were two factors 
first   of gas cost increases were absorbed in the state of oregon 
second  rates to oregon customers were decreased to recognize decreased property tax expense see cost of operations  reducing margins by approximately  consumption per customer is driven by the mix of customers  particularly in the commercial class  the number and type of appliances used  and weather 
weather for  as measured by estimated degree days  was approximately warmer than fiscal fiscal margins from residential and commercial customers increased by  over the twelve months ended september  fiscal  primarily due to  new customers  coupled with a moderate increase in the average gas usage per residential customer 
industrial and other margin 
the comparison of operating margin from industrial and other customers is affected by the charge of  related to unrecovered gas cost  recorded in the june quarter 
other than the effect of this charge  margins increased by  or  for fiscal these increases are primarily due to the addition of new customers  including service to a new cogeneration customer that began commercial operation in june fiscal margins from industrial and other customers declined by approximately  from fiscal  due primarily to the charge mentioned above 
other than this charge  margins increased by approximately  attributable to the cogeneration customer that started in june and another one that commenced june cost of operations cost of operations consists of operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  and property and payroll taxes 
for the twelve month periods ended september    and  these amounts were   and  respectively 
operating expenses for fiscal  which are primarily labor and benefits expenses  increased by  or  over fiscal of this increase   is attributable to deferred recognition of postretirement benefits other than pensions pbop 
from january through july  a portion of pbop expenses were deferred  in accordance with a policy statement issued by the washington utilities and transportation commission in concurrent with the settlement of the washington rate case  effective august   ongoing pbop expenses are no longer deferred  and amortization of the previously deferred amounts is also included in operating expenses  resulting in the expense increase 
the new customer rates include recognition of this higher level of pbop expenses 
labor costs increased by  or  related to normal wage and salary rate adjustments  as well as to higher compensation levels commensurate with a more highly skilled work force 
fiscal expenses increased by  or over fiscal these increases were primarily attributable to payroll and benefit plan cost increases  as well as additional costs related to the change in the company s fiscal year 
depreciation and amortization for fiscal increased by  or over fiscal  which is attributable to increases in depreciable utility plant to serve a growing customer base 
property and payroll taxes for fiscal decreased by  or  compared to fiscal higher property taxes related to increases in assets are more than offset by reductions in oregon tax rates resulting from a voter referendum 
these oregon rate reductions have no significant effect on net earnings because the effect of reductions had previously been deferred in accordance with the policy established by the oregon public utility commission 
these deferrals are currently being amortized  resulting in current recognition of the effect of the reductions  and rates charged to oregon customers have been reduced accordingly see operating margin 
increases in depreciation and amortization and in property and payroll taxes in fiscal over fiscal are primarily due to increases in utility plant 
nonoperating expense income interest expense decreased by  or from fiscal this is due to lower average amounts of short term debt outstanding  and interest accruals on deferred gas cost savings  partially offset by lower interest accruals on deferred gas cost increases 
other non operating income increased by  to  the primary factors resulting in this increase were a gain of  on the sale of a parcel of land  compared to a charge of  relating to valuation reserves against other assets 
additionally  there was less interest income in fiscal because of fewer amounts of appliance loans outstanding 
income taxes the increase in the provision for federal and state income taxes is primarily attributable to the increase in pre tax earnings 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonal nature of the company s business creates short term cash requirements to finance customer accounts receivable and construction expenditures 
to provide working capital for these requirements  the company has a five year credit commitment for million from three banks 
the committed lines also support a money market facility of a similar amount and a regional commercial paper program 
a subsidiary company has a million five year revolving credit facility used for non regulated business  and at september   million was outstanding 
the company also has million of uncommitted lines from three banks 
the balance of medium term notes at september  was million 
there is remaining million registered under the securities act of and available for issuance 
because of the availability of short term credit and the ability to issue long term debt and additional equity  management believes it has adequate financial flexibility to meet its anticipated cash needs 
operating activities operating activities resulted in a net cash flow of  for fiscal  compared to  for the nine month transition period ended september   in spite of increased net earnings 
the reduction is primarily due to higher gas costs incurred during the heating season 
for  the cost of gas purchased exceeded the gas cost used to establish the company s sales tariffs  resulting in a negative cash flow of  for the nine months ended september   the cost of gas was less than the gas cost level established in the company s sales tariffs  resulting in a positive cash flow of  this represents a difference of  between the two periods 
the effect of these differences in gas costs  except the oregon amounts absorbed by the company  as discussed above under operating margin  has been deferred  and thus had no effect on net earnings 
the company will file for recovery of these deferred amounts from customers through purchased gas rate adjustments over future periods 
by the end of fiscal  gas costs returned to a level approximately equivalent to the base cost level established in the company s tariffs 
operating activities were also affected by seasonal changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued expenses  prepaid expenses  and other  resulting in decreased cash flow of  from the nine month transition period ended september  investing activities cash used by investing activities in fiscal was  compared to  for the transition period 
the reduction in investing activities is the result of an unusually high amount   of customer contributions in aid and advances for construction primarily related to expenditures on a project completed in fiscal in the prior period  the level of customer contributions in aid and advances for construction was a more normal  budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal are approximately million  which is expected to be financed approximately from operating activities  and from a combination of debt and equity financing 
financing activities the principal financing activity for was the issuance of  of new medium term notes  completed in september 
in addition the company raised  of new equity capital through its dividend reinvestment program and through sales of common stock to its k plan 
regulatory matters for the past seven years  the company has been able to achieve normalized results in oregon greater than its allowed rate of return 
recognizing that the limitations inherent in traditional utility regulation could  at some point  inhibit further productivity improvements in that state  the company has been cooperatively exploring alternatives with the staff of the oregon public utility commission 
ideally  both shareholders and customers should be able to benefit fairly from efficiency gains 
in september   the company decreased oregon rates by  annually 
the lower rates share with customers some of the benefits of increased productivity and lower capital costs since the company s last general rate case in  and can better serve as a starting point for new methods it may develop for sharing future improvements 
the new rates are expected to reduce net income by  annually and to produce an implied return on equity of in oregon 
environmental matters as reported in the company s q reports for the quarters ended march and june   the company has received notice and is investigating allegations of environmental contamination from a former manufactured gas plant site in washington previously operated by the company 
the company has not yet determined the existence or extent of the alleged contamination 
to the extent the company may be responsible for all or part of the cost relating to such contamination  it expects to seek contribution from other site owners and its insurers  and would seek appropriate rate relief 
contingent liabilities like most entities that are heavily reliant on business application computer software  the company is affected by the fact that many of its computer programs are not year compliant 
the result would be that in the year  the computer programs would not operate as intended 
the company is currently in the process of identifying and correcting computer programs which are not year compliant 
the implementation plan will involve a combination of correcting existing program code  and acquiring new programs to replace non compliant programs 
much of this effort will coincide with the company s plan to upgrade its applications software over the next few years 
the conversion is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows  or financial position
