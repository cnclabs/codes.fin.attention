item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations compared with national fuel s earnings were million  or per common share  in this compares with earnings of million  or per common share  in the earnings increase in was attributable to higher earnings of the company s utility and pipeline and storage segments  as well as a reduction in losses of its other nonregulated segment  partly offset by lower earnings of the exploration and production segment 
utility earnings increased as a result of new rates effective in october and lower operation and maintenance o m expense 
partly offsetting these positive impacts to earnings was warmer weather in compared with  as well as the inclusion in earnings of a downward revision of estimated purchased gas costs for the pipeline and storage segment earnings increase was attributable to higher revenue from unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation  as well as lower o m expense for the year 
in the other nonregulated segment  net losses in were significantly less than in the losses included expenses associated with the company s withdrawal from participation in an international power project 
exploration and production earnings decreased as a result of higher operation and depletion expense  which more than offset increased revenues resulting from increased prices and the slight increase in production 
compared with national fuel s earnings were million  or per common share  in this compares with earnings of million  or per common share  in the earnings increase in was attributable to higher earnings of the company s exploration and production  utility  and pipeline and storage segments 
the other nonregulated segment incurred losses in as compared with earnings in exploration and production earnings increased because of significant increases in natural gas and oil production combined with higher gas and oil prices 
the earnings increase of the utility segment reflects the positive impact of colder weather  new rates that became effective in september in both the new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions  and the results of management s emphasis on controlling o m expense 
also  purchased gas cost adjustments in the utility segment s new york jurisdiction increased earnings 
the pipeline and storage segment s earnings increase was attributable to a retroactive rate increase combined with the recording of a reserve for a storage project in partly offsetting the increased earnings of the pipeline and storage segment were lower revenues related to unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation 
an early retirement offer to certain salaried  non union hourly and union employees of both the utility and pipeline and storage segments resulted in a reduction to earnings for both segments 
the losses of the other nonregulated segment were mainly attributable to withdrawal from an international power project

the increase in off system sales reflects the continued emphasis by distribution corporation to utilize available capacity on various upstream pipelines 
while off system sales contributed to the revenue increase  the margins on such sales  after sharing with customers  are minimal 
other operating revenues in were reduced by a million cumulative refund provision to the utility s customers for a sharing of earnings over a predetermined amount in accordance with the new york rate settlement of july compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with this increase reflects general rate increases in the new york and pennsylvania rate jurisdictions  effective in september  pass through of increased gas costs  higher transportation volumes and higher off system sales 
the base rate increases amounted to million and million in new york and pennsylvania  respectively 
the recovery of increased gas costs was due to higher gas sales volumes mainly due to weather that was  on average  colder than as well as a increase in the average cost of purchased gas see discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
higher transportation volumes due to colder weather  new customers and increases in production at various manufacturing facilities also contributed to higher operating revenues 
the increase in off system sales reflects the continued utilization of distribution corporation s available capacity on various upstream pipelines 
as noted above  the margins on such sales are minimal 
operating income compared with operating income before income taxes increased million in compared with the increase resulted primarily from the increases in revenue discussed above combined with lower o m expense partly offset by certain purchased gas costs adjustments  totalling million  associated with lost and unaccounted for gas in the new york division of distribution corporation that lowered purchased gas expense in o m expense decreased primarily as a result of an early retirement offer to certain salaried  non union hourly and union employees of distribution corporation that was effective october  the results included expenses for this retirement offer of million 
the results include million of operating expenses associated with an early retirement offer to certain pennsylvania operating union employees in o m expense also decreased as a result of management s continued emphasis on controlling costs 
the impact of weather on distribution corporation s new york rate jurisdiction is tempered by a weather normalization clause wnc 
the wnc in new york  which covers the eight month period from october through may  has had a stabilizing effect on pre tax operating income and earnings for the new york rate jurisdiction 
in addition  in periods of colder than normal weather  the wnc benefits distribution corporation s new york customers 
in  the wnc in new york resulted in a benefit to customers of million as weather  overall  was colder than normal for the period of october through may since the pennsylvania rate jurisdiction does not have a wnc  uncontrollable weather variations directly impact pre tax operating income and earnings 
in the pennsylvania service territory  weather was warmer than last year and colder than normal 
the warmer weather in compared with lowered pre tax operating income by approximately million 
compared with operating income before income taxes increased million in compared with the increase reflects higher gas revenue  as discussed above 
it also reflects certain purchased gas cost adjustments associated with lost and unaccounted for gas in distribution corporation s new york jurisdiction having a net impact of reducing purchased gas expense by million 
partly offsetting the above increases was the impact of an early retirement offer to certain salaried  non union hourly and union employees of distribution corporation resulting in additional operating expenses in the utility segment of million in this offer was undertaken as a means to reduce future costs 
in  the wnc in new york resulted in a benefit to customers of million as weather  overall  was colder than normal for the period of october through may in the pennsylvania service territory  weather in was colder than in and colder than normal 
the colder weather in compared with had a positive impact on the pennsylvania rate jurisdiction s pre tax operating income of approximately million 
degree days percent warmer colder in than year ended september normal actual normal buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   purchased gas the cost of purchased gas is by far the company s single largest operating expense 
annual variations in purchased gas costs can be attributed directly to changes in gas sales volumes  the price of gas purchased and the operation of purchased gas adjustment clauses 
currently  distribution corporation has contracted for long term firm transportation capacity with supply corporation and six other upstream pipeline companies  for long term gas supplies with a combination of producers and marketers and for storage service with supply corporation and three nonaffiliated companies 
in addition  distribution corporation can satisfy a portion of its gas requirements through spot market purchases 
changes in wellhead prices have a direct impact on the cost of purchased gas 
distribution corporation s average cost of purchased gas  including the cost of transportation and storage  was per thousand cubic feet mcf in  an increase of from the average cost of per mcf in the average cost of purchased gas in was higher than the per mcf in pipeline and storage operating revenues compared with operating revenues decreased million in compared with as discussed below  revenues reflected a rate increase which was retroactive to june  the retroactive rates added approximately million to revenues in that related to the corresponding decrease in primarily impacted storage service revenues  which decreased by million 
in addition to the retroactive rate impact  storage service revenues decreased as a result of customers opting for more flexible services at discounted rates 
a slight increase in transportation revenues primarily reflects an increase in surcharge adjustments 
other operating revenues decreased slightly as higher revenues from unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation an increase of million was more than offset by lower cashout revenue a cash resolution of a gas imbalance whereby a customer pays supply corporation for gas it receives in excess of amounts delivered into supply corporation s system by the customer s shipper 
cashout revenue decreased by million 
however  there is no earnings impact as cashout revenue is offset by an equal amount of purchased gas expense 
while transportation volumes in this segment decreased bcf  the decrease in volumes did not have a significant impact on earnings as a result of supply corporation s straight fixed variable sfv rate design 
compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with higher transportation and storage revenues reflect the impact of a million rate increase effective on april  retroactive to june  the retroactive rates added approximately million to revenues in that relate to higher volumes of gas transported as well as certain surcharge adjustments also increased revenues in other operating revenues increased only slightly  but include an increase of approximately million related to cashout revenue mostly offset by a decrease of approximately million related to unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation 
operating income compared with operating income before income taxes increased million in compared with this slight increase primarily reflects lower o m expenses including labor combined with higher revenues related to unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation 
the cost of an early retirement offer to certain pennsylvania operating union employees in resulted in million of additional operating expenses 
however  such expenses were million less than the expenses associated with the early retirement offer  as discussed below 
partly offsetting these increases was the retroactive rate effect recorded in and lower storage service revenues  as discussed above 
compared with operating income before income taxes increased million in compared with this increase reflects the revenue increase discussed above as well as the recording of a million reserve in the fourth quarter of for previously deferred preliminary survey and investigation charges for a storage project 
partly offsetting the increase was the impact of higher operating expenses  including an early retirement offer to certain salaried  non union hourly and union employees of supply corporation resulting in additional operating expenses in the pipeline and storage segment of million in this offer was undertaken as a means to reduce future costs 
exploration and production operating revenues compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with gas revenues increased million as a result of higher prices the weighted average gas price increased per mcf slightly offset by decreased natural gas production 
oil revenues increased million as a result of increases in oil production and prices 
the weighted average oil price increased per barrel bbl see tables below 
the increase in oil production is the result of a full year of production in at vermilion compared with only seven months in partly offsetting the increase in gas and oil revenue was the recognition of a pre tax loss on hedging of approximately million compared with a pre tax loss of million in gains or losses on hedging activities are offset by lower or higher prices received for actual natural gas and crude oil production 
refer to further discussion of the company s hedging activities under financing cash flow and in note f financial instruments in item of this report 
compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with gas revenues increased million as a result of an increase in natural gas production and an increase in the weighted average gas price of per mcf 
oil revenues increased million as a result of production  which was more than twice the prior year  and an increase in the weighted average oil price of per bbl see tables below 
in  natural gas and oil production was delayed when prices were low in order to preserve the value received for reserves 
increased production reflects offshore finds at west cameron and vermilion and the acquisition of west delta block in september  as well as production from the hamp lease acquisition in california 
partly offsetting the above increases in gas and oil revenues was the recognition of a pre tax loss on hedging of approximately million in compared with a pre tax gain of million in refer to further discussion of the company s hedging activities under financing cash flow and in note f financial instruments in item of this report

operating income compared with operating income before income taxes decreased million in compared with this decrease reflects higher depletion expense and higher operating expenses lease operating expenses  salary expenses and production taxes due to increased activities  which more than offset the increase in revenues  discussed above 
compared with operating income before income taxes increased million in compared with this increase reflects the higher operating revenues discussed above  partly offset by higher depletion expense and higher operating expenses lease operating expenses and production taxes due to increased production 
other nonregulated operating revenues compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with the increase primarily reflects higher operating revenues from nfr  the company s gas marketing subsidiary  and highland  the company s sawmill and timber subsidiary 
nfr s operating revenues increased largely because of higher natural gas prices and an increase in marketing volumes 
also  nfr recognized a pre tax gain on futures contracts of approximately million during compared to a pre tax gain of approximately million in refer to further discussion of the company s hedging activities under financing cash flow and in note f financial instruments in item of this report 
highland s operating revenues increased as a result of increased lumber sales resulting from the operation of a new lumber mill beginning in january compared with operating revenues increased million in compared with the increase primarily reflects higher operating revenues from nfr  largely because of higher natural gas prices and an increase in marketing volumes 
also  nfr recognized a pre tax gain on futures contracts of approximately million during compared to a pre tax gain of approximately million in offsetting this increase was a decrease in operating revenues from uci  the company s discontinued pipeline construction subsidiary 
operating income compared with the other nonregulated segment experienced an operating loss before income taxes of million in as compared with an operating loss before income taxes of million in the decrease in operating loss relates primarily to expenses incurred in the prior year by horizon  the company s foreign and domestic energy projects subsidiary  relating to its withdrawal from participation in an international power project in august in  horizon sold its rights to this power project for approximately million  including cash proceeds and the assumption of certain liabilities by the purchaser 
as discussed below  the entire project was written off in partly offsetting the lower losses of horizon was increased depletion expenses in this segment s timber operations related to cutting timber with a higher cost 
compared with the other nonregulated segment experienced an operating loss before income taxes of million in compared with operating income before income taxes of million in expenses incurred by horizon were the main factors in this decrease 
in august  horizon withdrew from participation in the development of a megawatt power plant near kabirwala  punjab province  in east central pakistan kabirwala project 
as a result of this withdrawal  certain pre operating costs were charged to earnings 
total pre tax charges in associated with the kabirwala project were approximately million 
uci also experienced a significant decrease in operating income before income taxes as a result of discontinuing its pipeline construction operations late in nfr experienced an increase in operating income before income taxes based primarily on increased volumes marketed 
income taxes  other income and interest charges income taxes income taxes increased million and million in and  respectively  mainly because of an increase in pre tax income 
other income other income decreased million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease resulted  in part  from certain nonrecurring items recorded in for supply corporation  including a gain on disposition of property  as well as interest income related to a retroactive rate settlement 
in addition  the decrease reflects losses from leidy hub s equity investment in various gas hub partnerships and losses from horizon s equity investment in severoceske teplarny  as sct 
the sct losses relate to the period april when horizon made its initial equity investment in sct through september  since sct is a heating utility  it typically experiences losses during the summer months 
the decrease resulted primarily because included a gain of million recorded by uci on the sale of its pipeline construction equipment 
this was partly offset by the nonrecurring items  noted above  that were recorded in interest charges interest on long term debt increased million in  however  it did not change significantly in compared with the increase in can be attributed to a higher average amount of long term debt outstanding in  offset slightly by a lower average interest rate 
although there was a higher average amount of long term debt outstanding in compared with  this was almost completely offset by a lower average interest rate 
other interest charges decreased million in and increased million in the decrease in resulted primarily from lower interest expense on amounts payable to customers offset in part by higher interest on short term borrowings because of higher average amounts outstanding 
the increase in resulted primarily from a higher average balance of outstanding short term borrowings offset partly by a lower weighted average interest rate on such borrowings 
additionally  experienced an increase in interest expense as a result of higher interest on amounts payable to customers 
capital resources and liquidity the primary sources and uses of cash during the last three years are summarized in the following condensed statement of cash flows sources uses of cash year ended september in millions provided by operating activities capital expenditures short term debt  net change long term debt  net change issuance of common stock common dividends investment in unconsolidated foreign subsidiary other investing activities net increase decrease in cash and temporary cash investments operating cash flow internally generated cash from operating activities consists of net income available for common stock  adjusted for noncash expenses  noncash income and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
noncash items include depreciation  depletion and amortization  deferred income taxes and allowance for funds used during construction 
cash provided by operating activities in the utility and pipeline and storage segments may vary substantially from year to year because of the impact of rate cases 
in the utility segment  supplier refunds  over or under recovered purchased gas costs and weather also significantly impact cash flow 
the company considers supplier refunds and over recovered purchased gas costs as a substitute for short term borrowings 
the impact of weather on cash flow is tempered in the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction by its wnc and in the pipeline and storage segment by supply corporation s sfv rate design 
net cash provided by operating activities totalled million in  an increase of million compared with the million provided by operating activities in the majority of this increase occurred in the utility segment as a result of an increase in cash receipts from gas sales and transportation service  a net increase in cash received as refunds from upstream pipelines  and lower o m costs 
lower o m costs in the pipeline and storage segment also contributed to the increase as did an increase in cash receipts from gas and oil sales in the exploration and production segment 
investing cash flow capital expenditures capital expenditures represent the company s additions to property  plant and equipment and are exclusive of equity investments in corporations and or partnerships 
the company s cash outlay for capital expenditures totalled million in noncash capital expenditures totalled million in the other nonregulated segment and related to seneca s issuance of long term notes to third parties in exchange for land and timber 
the table below presents these expenditures by business segment year ended september in millions utility pipeline and storage exploration and production other nonregulated most of the utility segment s capital expenditures were for the replacement of mains and main extensions  as well as for the replacement of service lines and  to a minor extent  the installation of new services 
the bulk of the pipeline and storage segment s capital expenditures were made for additions  improvements and replacements to this segment s transmission and storage systems 
the exploration and production segment spent approximately million on its offshore program in the gulf of mexico  including offshore drilling expenditures  geological expenditures and lease acquisitions 
offshore exploratory and development drilling was concentrated on ship shoal  vermilion  high island  main pass  main pass  west cameron  west delta  west cameron  vermilion  galveston  high island a and high island offshore lease acquisitions included south marsh island  mustang island and in texas state waters and eugene island and in louisiana state waters 
other offshore acquisitions included east cameron  visca knowl  oxy high island a  barrett high island a and shell high island approximately million was spent on the exploration and production segment s onshore program  including horizontal drilling in central texas and developmental and exploratory drilling in california 
in addition  acquisitions included leases in california and wyoming 
other nonregulated capital expenditures consisted primarily of timberland purchases 
the company s estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are year ended september in millions utility pipeline and storage exploration and production other nonregulated estimated expenditures for the utility segment during the next three years will be concentrated in the areas of main replacements and extensions  service line replacements and  to a minor extent  the installation of new services 
estimated expenditures for the pipeline and storage segment in will be concentrated in the reconditioning of storage wells and the replacement of storage and transmission lines 
approximately million is included in the budget for the niagara expansion project  which would provide approximately  dekatherms dth per day of firm year round capacity and  dth per day of firm winter only capacity from the niagara falls  new york import point to interconnections at leidy and wharton  pennsylvania 
supply corporation began transportation service for the additional  dth per day in november and has filed for federal energy regulatory commission ferc approval concerning the  dth per day expansion of firm winter only capacity 
supply corporation anticipates receiving such ferc approval by april or may of supply corporation also has a proposed niagara expansion project expansion  which would expand transportation capacity from the canadian border at niagara falls  new york  to leidy  pennsylvania 
given the uncertain status of the expansion  no amount has been included in the or budget as the timing of the go ahead for the expansion will depend on several factors  including signed precedent agreements and ferc approval 
a timetable has not been set for filing with the ferc 
estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment are approximately higher than capital spending in as the company sees significant opportunities for growth in this segment 
these expenditures will be directed mainly toward developing seneca s offshore and onshore prospects  reserve acquisitions and significantly expanding exploration activities 
approximately of these expenditures will be directed offshore 
in november  the company signed a letter of intent with the whittier trust company to purchase for cash properties in the midway sunset and lost hills field in the san joaquin basin of california 
this potential acquisition will complement the exploration and production segment s reserve mix  bringing its new potential reserve base to oil and gas 
this potential acquisition would also provide the exploration and production segment with the opportunity to continue its focus of growth by increasing its activities in the domestic onshore areas 
the purchase price of these properties is expected to be in the range of million to million and is dependent upon various factors  including acceptance by trust participants and swapping of certain coalinga field properties for additional properties in the midway sunset fields 
the company anticipates financing this purchase with long term debt 
no amount for this potential acquisition has been included in the estimated capital expenditure table above 
the company s capital expenditure program is under continuous review 
the amounts are subject to modification for opportunities such as the acquisition of attractive oil and gas properties  timber or storage facilities and the expansion of transmission line capacities 
while the majority of capital expenditures in the utility segment are necessitated by the continued need for replacement and upgrading of mains and service lines  the magnitude of future capital expenditures in the company s other business segments depends  to a large degree  upon market conditions 
investment in unconsolidated foreign subsidiary in  horizon s wholly owned subsidiary  bruwabel  acquired a equity interest in sct 
sct is a company with district heating and power generation operations located in the northern part of the czech republic 
for calendar  sct reported profits of approximately million 
bruwabel paid million  including legal and finders fees  for its equity interest 
bruwabel received a dividend of million from its investment in sct during in december  bruwabel acquired an additional equity interest in sct for approximately million  thus raising its total ownership to 
as such  bruwabel will begin to consolidate sct into its financial statements during the first quarter of the acquisition was financed with short term borrowings 
bruwabel s investment in sct is valued in czech korunas  and as such  this investment is subject to currency exchange risk when the czech korunas are translated into us dollars 
during  the czech koruna devalued in relation to the us dollar  resulting in a negative adjustment to stockholders equity in the amount of approximately million 
this amount is reported as a cumulative translation adjustment in common stock equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
if the czech koruna increases in value in relation to the us dollar  the million cumulative translation adjustment could reverse and potentially become a positive adjustment to common stock equity 
management cannot predict whether the czech koruna will increase or decrease in value against the us dollar 
other investing activities other cash provided by or used in investing activities reflects cash received on the sale of the company s investment in property  plant and equipment and cash used for other investments 
in june  the company announced its intention to join as an equal partner in the independence pipeline project  which is designed to bring gas from defiance  ohio to leidy  pennsylvania and is expected to cost million 
the independence pipeline project as filed with the ferc will consist of approximately miles of inch diameter pipe with an initial capacity of approximately  dth per day 
in september  the company formed a new subsidiary  seneca independence pipeline company sip  which has agreed to purchase  upon receipt of regulatory approval  a one third general partnership interest in independence pipeline company  a delaware general partnership 
if the independence pipeline project is not constructed  sip s share of the development costs is estimated not to exceed million to million 
it is expected that sip will invest approximately million in the partnership during sip will most likely use short term borrowings for the projected investments in in november  supply corporation entered into a memorandum of understanding the mou with green canyon gathering company  a subsidiary of el paso energy  regarding a project to develop  construct  finance  own and operate natural gas gathering and processing facilities offshore and onshore louisiana  at an estimated total cost of about million 
the mou has been amended several times since then  and currently provides for the parties to i share past and future development costs for the project through december   and ii negotiate toward definitive agreements to form one or more entities and to finance  develop  build  own and operate the project 
the ferc ruled in march that most of the project would be jurisdictional  so additional regulatory filings would be necessary to construct and operate the project 
the parties will prepare and make those filings whenever justified by customer demand 
if the mou expires without any additional filings at the ferc  supply corporation s share of the development costs through december  is unlikely to exceed million  of which supply corporation had paid about million as of september  these paid costs are recorded in deferred charges on the consolidated balance sheet at september  supply corporation is currently using short term borrowings to finance the project 
financing cash flow in order to meet the company s capital requirements  cash from external sources must periodically be obtained through short term bank loans and commercial paper  as well as through issuances of long term debt and equity securities 
the company expects these traditional sources of cash to continue to supplement its internally generated cash during the next several years 
in august  the company issued million of medium term notes due in august after reflecting underwriting discounts and commissions  the net proceeds to the company amounted to million 
such proceeds were used to reduce short term borrowings 
in november  the company retired million of medium term notes 
short term borrowings were used to retire these notes 
the company s embedded cost of long term debt was and at september  and  respectively 
consolidated short term debt decreased million during the company continues to consider short term bank loans and commercial paper important sources of cash for temporarily financing capital expenditures  gas in storage inventory  unrecovered purchased gas costs  exploration and development expenditures and other working capital needs 
in addition  the company considers supplier refunds and over recovered purchased gas costs as a substitute for short term debt 
fluctuations in these items can have a significant impact on the amount and timing of short term debt 
the company s present liquidity position is believed to be adequate to satisfy known demands 
under the company s covenants contained in its indenture covering its long term debt  as amended  the company would have been permitted to issue up to a maximum of approximately million in additional long term unsecured indebtedness at september   in light of then current long term interest rates 
in addition  at september   the company had regulatory authorizations and unused short term credit lines that would have permitted it to borrow an additional million of short term debt 
the amounts and timing of the issuance and sale of debt and or equity securities will depend on market conditions  regulatory authorizations and the requirements of the company 
the company  through seneca  has entered into certain price swap agreements to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the market price of natural gas and crude oil 
these price swap agreements are not held for trading purposes 
during  seneca utilized natural gas and crude oil price swap agreements with notional amounts of equivalent bcf and  equivalent bbl  respectively 
these hedging activities resulted in the recognition of a pre tax loss of approximately million 
this loss was offset by higher prices received for actual natural gas and crude oil production 
at september   seneca had natural gas price swap agreements outstanding with a notional amount of approximately equivalent bcf at prices ranging from per mcf to per mcf 
the weighted average fixed price of these swap agreements is approximately per mcf 
seneca also had crude oil price swap agreements outstanding at september  with a notional amount of  equivalent bbl at prices ranging from per bbl to per bbl 
the weighted average fixed price of these swap agreements is approximately per bbl 
the company  through nfr  participates in the natural gas futures market to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
such futures are not held for trading purposes 
during  nfr recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million related to such futures contracts 
since these futures contracts qualify and have been designated as hedges  any gains or losses resulting from market price changes are substantially offset by the related commodity transaction 
at september   nfr had long positions in the futures market amounting to a notional amount of bcf at prices ranging from per mcf to per mcf 
the weighted average contract price of these futures contracts is approximately per mcf 
nfr had short positions in the futures market amounting to a notional amount of bcf at prices ranging from per mcf to per mcf 
the weighted average contract price of these futures contracts is approximately per mcf 
in addition  the company has sec authority to enter into certain interest rate swap agreements 
for further discussion of the company s derivative financial instruments  see disclosure in note f financial instruments under the heading derivative financial instruments in item of this report 
the company s credit risk is the risk of loss that the company would incur as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations related to investments  such as temporary cash investments  cash surrender values of insurance contracts  and derivative financial instruments 
the company does not anticipate any material impact to its financial position  results of operations or cash flow as a result of nonperformance by counterparties

the company is involved in litigation arising in the normal course of its business 
in addition to the regulatory matters discussed in note b regulatory matters  in item of this report  the company is involved in other regulatory matters arising in the normal course of business that involve rate base  cost of service and purchased gas cost issues 
while the resolution of such litigation or other regulatory matters could have a material effect on earnings and cash flows in the year of resolution  neither this litigation nor these other regulatory matters are expected to materially change the company s present liquidity position nor have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company at this time 
rate matters utility new york jurisdiction in november  distribution corporation filed in its new york jurisdiction a request for an annual rate increase of million with a requested return on equity of 
a two year settlement with the parties in this rate proceeding was approved by the public service commission of the state of new york psc 
effective october  and october   distribution corporation received annual base rate increases of million 
the settlement did not specify a rate of return on equity 
generally  earnings above a return on equity excluding certain items and determined on a cumulative basis over the three years ending september  will be shared equally between shareholders and ratepayers 
as a result of this sharing mechanism  distribution corporation recorded an estimated cumulative refund provision to its customers of million million after tax during the fourth quarter of the final amount owed to customers  if any  will not be known until the conclusion of the settlement period 
in june  the psc issued an order requiring jurisdictional utilities to file plans to offer heating customers a fixed price service option for the coming winter heating season 
the order also directed the utilities to submit proposals for increased supply diversity with a view toward fostering price stability 
in august  distribution corporation filed in its new york jurisdiction a plan to comply with the psc s order and the psc subsequently approved the plan in october the fixed price service option that was approved gives heating customers the opportunity to be guaranteed a fixed unit price for natural gas during the billing period of december through april the option was made available on a first come  first served basis to a maximum of  heating customers 
approximately  heating customers chose the fixed price service option  which will fix the monthly gas adjustment at 
per hundred cubic feet  which is less than the average gas adjustment experienced during the heating season 
however  this rate is higher than the gas adjustment experienced during the heating season 
distribution corporation locked in commodity prices for approximately of the new york jurisdiction s planned purchases during the period of november through march other components of heating customers rates will remain unchanged 
new york s gas industry restructuring effort continues to develop at a slow pace 
as of the end of september   small volume customers across the state chose aggregator services over their utility 
in distribution corporation s service territory   small volume customers out of over  are purchasing gas from eight aggregators  for a total annual load of just over bcf 
at the urging of the psc  distribution corporation began to offer storage release service to aggregators on june  currently  distribution s is the only actual release storage service available in new york state 
whether aggregators find the service attractive enough to increase marketing activity remains to be seen 
pennsylvania jurisdiction distribution corporation currently does not have a rate case on file with the pennsylvania public utility commission papuc 
management will continue to monitor its financial position in the pennsylvania jurisdiction to determine the necessity of filing a rate case in the future 
in april  distribution corporation filed a proposal for a customer choice pilot program  called energy select  with the papuc 
the papuc approved energy select in june and service commenced on october  energy select  which will last one and one half years  allows approximately  small commercial and residential customers of distribution corporation in the greater sharon  pennsylvania area to purchase gas supplies from qualified  participating non utility suppliers or marketers of gas 
distribution corporation is not a supplier of gas in this pilot 
under energy select  distribution corporation will continue to deliver the gas to the customer s home or business and will remain responsible for reading customer meters  the safety and maintenance of its pipeline system and responding to gas emergencies 
the company s marketing affiliate  nfr  is a participating supplier in energy select 
general rate increases in both the new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions do not reflect the recovery of purchased gas costs 
such costs are recovered through operation of the purchased gas adjustment clauses 
state regulatory environment the new york and pennsylvania regulatory commissions continue to address restructuring of the gas industry in response to the ferc s order distribution corporation is working closely with the state regulatory commissions to resolve issues consistent with distribution corporation objectives 
current proceedings and other regulatory and legislative developments are discussed below new york generic restructuring proceeding 
this proceeding is examining the appropriate retail or end use impacts resulting from the ferc s order pipeline restructuring 
on march   the psc issued an order directing the state s local distribution companies ldcs  including distribution corporation  to file additional tariff amendments regarding this proceeding 
on april   distribution corporation submitted a filing  effective may  on a temporary basis  proposing to amend its services to provide a framework for small customer aggregation in compliance with the psc s march  order distribution corporation already offers unbundled  flexible service to its commercial and industrial customers 
the changes provide the option for all customers to choose from whom they want to buy gas  which could be distribution corporation  another utility  or a non utility supplier or marketer 
if a customer purchases gas from a supplier other than distribution corporation  the supplier would obtain and transport the gas to distribution corporation s pipeline system and distribution corporation would then deliver the gas to the customer 
distribution corporation would continue to be responsible for maintaining its pipelines and responding to safety calls  but billing and other traditional services would be assumed by the alternate supplier 
on september   the psc issued an order approving the april  filing  subject to additional changes 
further revisions were filed as directed for an effective date of october  on june   distribution corporation s tariff was further amended to provide unbundled storage capacity to qualified marketers 
filed and approved in compliance with the psc s restructuring orders  the service allows marketers to take release of distribution corporation s storage and transmission capacity in order to serve retail end users through the aggregation services described above 
the service includes  to the extent necessary  inventory transfers at pre determined prices 
on september   the psc issued an order addressing upstream capacity requirements for ldcs 
in the psc s march  order  the ldcs  including distribution corporation  were authorized to require converting sales customers or their marketers to take an allocation of upstream capacity for up to a three year period 
the psc stated that prior to the start of the third year april  each utility would be required to demonstrate its efforts to relieve itself of excess capacity 
the psc further held that we will address any issues of stranded costs then 
the september  order implements the third year review by directing the state s ldcs to  no later than april   submit plans addressing upstream capacity issues including stranded costs 
distribution corporation is currently reviewing its portfolio of upstream capacity consistent with the provisions of the september  order 
also  on september   the psc issued a notice inviting comments on a report prepared by the psc staff for the department of public service entitled the future of the natural gas industry position paper 
acknowledging that customer choice has not evolved as expected under the generic restructuring orders  the psc staff reaches the fundamental conclusion that the most effective way to establish a robustly competitive market in gas supply is to separate the merchant and distribution functions 
toward that end  the position paper sets forth a variety of recommendations addressing issues such as upstream capacity  rate design  system reliability  market power  customer communication  social programs and taxes 
the psc staff believes that a five year period is necessary for ldcs to transition out of the merchant business 
on november   distribution corporation filed initial comments supporting the psc staff s proposal that ldcs exit the merchant function 
additional comments consistent with distribution corporation s objectives were offered on other issues raised in the position paper 
pennsylvania the papuc has not issued a generic rulemaking for industry restructuring  opting instead for a case by case approach promoting small customer aggregation programs including distribution s energy select pilot described above 
two issues dealt with generically  however  are affiliate transactions and supplier fitness standards  for which the papuc adopted policy statements in june to the extent required  distribution corporation has already implemented procedures consistent with those policy statements 
on the legislative front  a gas restructuring bill was introduced in proposing to amend the public utility code to require that ldcs exit the merchant function in three years 
modeled after the electric competition law  house bill introduced in the senate as s 
would  if enacted  provide direct access to competitive markets for all retail gas customers 
the company is not able to predict the outcome of the bill 
however  it appears that the bill would not become law earlier than pipeline and storage on october   supply corporation filed for an annual rate increase of million  with a requested return on equity of 
in february  the ferc approved a settlement authorizing an annual rate increase of approximately million with a return on equity of 
the new rates were put into effect on april   retroactive to june  with this settlement  supply corporation agreed not to seek recovery for increased cost of service until april  supply corporation also agreed not to seek recovery of revenues related to certain terminated service from other storage customers until april   as long as the terminations were not greater than approximately of the terminable service 
management has been successful in marketing and obtaining executed contracts for such terminated storage service and does not anticipate a problem in obtaining executed contracts for additional terminated storage service as it arises 
other matters environmental matters the company is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
the company has established procedures for on going evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures 
it is the company s policy to accrue estimated environmental clean up costs when such amounts can reasonably be estimated and it is probable that the company will be required to incur such costs 
distribution corporation has estimated that clean up costs related to several former manufactured gas plant sites and several other waste disposal sites are in the range of million to million 
at september   distribution corporation has recorded the minimum liability of million 
the ultimate cost to distribution corporation with respect to the remediation of these sites will depend on such factors as the remediation plan selected  the extent of the site contamination  the number of additional potentially responsible parties at each site and the portion  if any  attributed to distribution corporation 
the company is currently not aware of any material additional exposure to environmental liabilities 
however  adverse changes in environmental regulations or other factors could impact the company
