the following pro forma balance sheet presentation is included to illustrate the effect on the company s financial position of the mip transaction 
these balance sheets show the company s actual financial position at december  as compared to how such balance sheet would appear had the mip transaction occurred on that date

mip is traded in us dollars on the toronto stock exchange the tse under the symbol mptu since the mip shares were restricted from sale by the company for days from the date of closing of the mip transaction  they were not immediately marginable 
in addition  gold line did not make any lease payments to the company in consequently  in order to redeem certain outstanding convertible debentures prior to their conversion by the holders thereof into the company s common stock  and to continue the expansion of its refinery  in april  the company sold  of  two year redeemable convertible debentures pursuant to regulation s the debentures to provide the required cash flows the company needs until it is able to margin or sell the mip shares 
it is the company s intent to margin or sell the mip shares as required and to utilize the proceeds therefrom to redeem all or a portion of the debentures  and certain other outstanding convertible debentures of the company as well  prior to their conversion into shares of the company s common stock 
however  to the extent it can  the company intends to retain the mip shares until the company s capital requirements dictate that they be sold 
the company believes that it has sufficient capital  or access thereto  to complete the expansion of its refinery in lake charles  louisiana the refinery to enable the implementation of its asphalt operations and to make any preliminary oil and gas related expenditures 
the asphalt and tolling operations are expected to provide the company with the future capital necessary to fund its oil and gas operations  or place the company in a position where it is able to access conventional financing for such projects 
the company expects to receive proceeds upon the final adjudication of its claim against gold line although the exact amount  if any  is indeterminable at this time 
during the next twelve months  the company plans to expend up to approximately million for the refinery expansion  which it expects to be funded in part by the debentures  internally generated cash flow from refinery operations  and or by the margin or sale of the mip shares and interest payments received from the exchangeable debenture 
the company is also having discussions with other financing entities who have expressed interest in financing further expansion of the refinery and future operations thereto 
the company s secured debentures the debentures  which had a principal and interest balance at december  of an aggregate of  were paid in full during the first quarter of  mostly from proceeds received from the mip transaction 
as of march   the company amended certain terms of its loan agreement with mg trade finance corp 
mgtf  extending the due date for the unpaid balance from may  to march  in addition  payments on the loan were reduced from to of the monthly lease fee proceeds the company received from leasing the refinery 
see refinery operations below 
if lease fees are not sufficient to satisfy all accrued interest and principal when due  the company is obligated to satisfy any shortfall 
the company may be required to fund future working capital requirements that arise from refinery operations 
the loan agreement contains certain restrictive covenants and requirements  however  the company and mgtf have from time to time amended the loan agreement or waived certain events of technical default 
as part of the mip transaction  the company agreed to change the maturity date for payment of the unpaid balance currently  to september  from march  in addition  the company pledged  shares of its mip common stock to further secure the loan agreement 
the company expects to pay the balance due on the loan agreement by the revised due date by margining or selling some of its mip shares  or with other conventional financing 
during  gold line incurred various financial and purchasing problems which resulted in diminished throughput volumes and lower lease fees to the company than in and also prevented gold line from making its note scheduled payments to the company of approximately  plus interest per quarter in september and december  and throughout these problems resulted in lower cash flow to the company requiring it to utilize other methods to acquire funds necessary to satisfy its monetary and contractual obligations  including the issuance of equity  as described above 
pursuant to the subordination agreement  the company has agreed to defer the receipt of certain amounts owing to it from gold line as at march   together with interest accruing thereon  until such time as gold line is in compliance with certain covenants under its financing with nationsbank 
it is impossible to predict when  if ever  gold line will be in compliance with such covenants and when  if ever  the company will be able to collect such obligations 
nonpayment thereof would not result in and additional charge against earnings 
there is no assurance of success of any financing efforts the company may pursue or the timing or success of it refinery vdu projects and or its potential projects 
in the event the company is not able to fund its projects on its own in a timely manner  management believes it will be able to obtain partners for certain projects  however  such projects could be delayed or curtailed 
impact of changing prices the company s revenues  its ability to repay indebtedness and the carrying value of its oil and gas properties owned from time to time are affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
oil and natural gas prices are subject to substantial seasonal  political and other fluctuations that are beyond the ability of the company to control 
since crude oil prices are an important determining factor in the carrying value of oil and gas assets  significant reductions in the price of crude oil could require non cash write downs of the carrying value of those assets 
for example  this occurred in  when  based on estimates of proven reserve quantities by the company s independent reservoir engineers  the company reduced the carrying value of its oil and gas assets by  during the fourth quarter of results of operations the following table highlights the results of operations for the years ended december   and for the years ended december  exploration and production activity colombia properties revenue oil sales s    lease operating expenses s production volume bbls    average price per bbl production cost per bbl dd a per bbl peru properties revenue oil sales s lease operating expenses s production volume bbls   average price per bbl production cost per bbl dd a per bbl refinery operations refinery lease fees s    average daily throughput bbls    average throughput fee

no dd a was calculated since all properties and related capital expenditures in peru were considered as unevaluated and therefore were excluded from the dd a calculation in each of  and refinery operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the company leased its refinery to gold line refinery ltd 
from until march  as lessee  gold line was responsible for all operating costs of the refinery 
the company charged gold line a fee for each barrel of feedstock processed at the refinery 
the fee during was 
per barrel of throughput  which increased to 
per barrel on january  this rate continued until the lease was terminated on march  refinery lease fee revenue increased by approximately in to  compared to  in the increase was due to the increase in the throughput processing fee from to per barrel processed and in the increase in its throughput barrels by during  primarily due to gold line having its feedstock financing in place throughout compared to being shutdown for the first quarter of due to a lack of financing 
in march of  gold line secured an additional one year  million fuel supply contract with the dfsc which  when combined with its then current dfsc contract increased processing requirements to between  and  barrels of feedstock per day 
however  because of non payment of lease fees and other items of default under the terms of the lease agreement  gold line was evicted from the refinery premises on march  the company plans to implement terminalling operations whereby the company will charge a processing fee for providing its refinery facilities as a terminal to store and process its customer s asphalt for distribution to local markets 
the company is also currently evaluating several fee processing options for operating the crude unit  which could provide the company with similar or better operating income than that formerly provided by the lease agreement 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  refinery lease fees declined by approximately in to  as compared to the decline relates primarily to financing and purchasing problems encountered by gold line during  as discussed above 
as a result  gold line experienced a decline in its annual throughput in compared to oil and gas production activity for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  oil production in decreased to  barrels of oil from  in  a decrease 
approximately of the decrease was attributed to the lack of any production from the peru properties during average oil prices  net of transportation  increased  however  by or per barrel to in  as compared to in due to renegotiated oil sales contracts and higher oil prices in the increase in oil prices during more than offset the decline in oil production for period  resulting in a increase in oil revenues in compared to production costs had a net increase of  or in compared to transportation costs of  accounted for of the increase in during  an increase in g a overhead allocation of  to production costs accounted for of the increase 
this increase in overhead allocation is directly related to a corresponding decrease in total g a expenses 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  oil production in increased to  barrels  a increase over average oil prices declined however  by or 
per barrel  to in as compared to in the net effect of these occurrences resulted in a  increase in the company s oil revenues in compared to production cost declined by  in compared to  primarily due to transportation costs incurred during the first four months of  which were not incurred after that time 
effective may  aipcc sold all of its crude oil directly to an end user at the wellhead  eliminating transportation costs 
other income other income decreased by approximately  during to  compared to  in this was due primarily to a decrease in interest income of to  compared to  in  due to a decrease in funds on deposit during other income increased by  during to  as compared to a increase in interest income in  related to the gold line note  was partially offset by a decrease in compared to of foreign exchange gains  primarily due to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates between the united state and colombia 
general and administrative for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  total general administrative expenses g a decreased during by  or compared to there was an additional  increase in in the provision for excise tax compared to the  provision charged in decreases in other g a expenses during compared to were decrease in payroll expense of  decrease in professional and consulting fees of  decrease in insurance costs of  and an increase in the capitalized and reimbursed g a expenses of  during the construction of the company s refinery project  which commenced during  approximately  of g a expenses were capitalized to the project 
further declines in g a are expected after february   due to the elimination of expenses related to the operation of aipcc and paipc 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  total g a during decreased by  or  compared to payroll expenses declined by  during compared to decreases also occurred in the following categories during versus professional fees   travel   office rents   public relations   insurance   and office operating expenses   interest interest expense increased by  in compared to  due primarily to million in imputed interest recorded for discounted convertible debentures  discussed below  and to  in interest expense related to a pending excise tax dispute with the irs 
the sec staff recently adopted a new position on accounting for convertible debt instruments which are convertible at a discount to the market price 
as a result  interest expense in reflects  related to the presumed incremental yield the investor may derive from the discounted conversion rate of such instruments issued by the company in management believes that the related amount of interest recorded by the company is not necessarily the true cost to the company of the instruments it issued and that it may be reasonable to conclude that the fair value of the common stock into which these securities may be converted was less than such stock s quoted market price at the date the convertible securities were issued considering factors such as the period for which sale of the stock is restricted which in certain cases was as long as six months  large block factors  lack of a sufficiently active market into which the stock can be quickly sold  time value  etc however  the sec believes that an intrinsic value of the conversion feature at the date of issuance should be accounted for and that such incremental yield should be measured based on the stock s quoted market price at the date of issuance  regardless if such yield is assured 
the sec staff has indicated that registrants using another value will bear the difficult burden of providing persuasive evidence that another value is more appropriate 
consequently  the company accounts for such instruments as directed by the sec 
the company also capitalizes certain other costs associated with the offering and sale of debentures 
such costs are amortized as interest expense over the life of the related debt instrument 
debenture costs amortized in increased by  to  as compared to in  interest expense is expected to decrease due to the expected issuance of fewer discounted convertible debt instruments  the pay down of debt in january and february  and anticipated reductions in same later in interest expense decreased by  during the year ended december  as compared to excluding a decrease in non cash amortized bond costs of  which are included in the interest expense category  interest expense decreased by  during versus  primarily due to reduced debt balances
