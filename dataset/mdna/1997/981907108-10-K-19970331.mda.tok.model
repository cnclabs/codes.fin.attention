other operating information worldtex provides service to over  customers  and no single customer accounted for more than of consolidated net sales 
nearly all of worldtex s sales are attributable to the sale of covered elastic yarn 
any significant decline in demand for covered elastic yarn would have a material adverse effect on the operations of worldtex 
the company regularly reviews expansion opportunities  but has no plans to enter any markets other than the manufacture of covered elastic yarns at the present time 
the company believes that recent trends in consumer preferences have put downward pressure on the sheer pantyhose market  and that alternative apparel  such as trouser socks  knee highs and anklets  have gained favor 
although the effect of these trends on the company in cannot be quantified  the company believes that it has not been material 
however  the company cannot predict the extent to which these trends may continue or their future effect on the company 
the company has sought to broaden the range of applications for covered yarn beyond pantyhose to a wide variety of apparel

spandex and nylon are the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of covered elastic yarn by worldtex 
worldtex purchases a significant amount of its nylon and spandex from a single source  dupont 
in recent years  dupont and its competitors have expanded their spandex production capacity  and worldtex has been able to obtain sufficient supplies to meet its customers requirements 
if the supply of spandex from dupont should be interrupted or cease for any reason  worldtex believes it might be difficult to find adequate alternative suppliers of spandex

in addition  at such date filix had million  rubyco million and fibrexa million of us dollar equivalent credit availability under bank lines of credit 
amounts outstanding as of december  were million for fibrexa  
million for rubyco and none outstanding for filix 
the most restrictive covenant of the credit agreement and note agreement limit short term borrowings by the company s subsidiaries to a total of million 
worldtex believes that these lines of credit  together with internally generated funds and access to other financing sources  will provide sufficient liquidity for the company s expected short term and long term cash requirements

worldtex will continue to monitor the impact of inflation in setting its pricing and other policies
