in july  the company completed the sale of million shares of common stock in the offering see note to the consolidated financial statements 
of the net proceeds of million  the company used million to repay  in full  non interest bearing advances from affiliates of knp bt made in and to finance acquisitions 
the company used the remaining net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness under the interest bearing advances from affiliates of knp bt made to the company for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
upon the completion of the offering  the company also entered into the antilliana credit agreement to provide funds for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
on august   the company entered into a million syndicated bank competitive advance and revolving credit facility agreement the bank credit agreement 
the bank credit agreement was used to pay down existing debt owing to affiliates of the company and is being used for working capital needs and general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
after entering into the bank credit agreement  the company reduced the commitments available under the antilliana credit agreement  which will expire in july  to million 
cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december  was million  which included million of net income and million of non cash depreciation and amortization charges 
significant cash requirements for included million related to acquisitions and million for capital expenditures 
these requirements were partially financed by million of net borrowings under notes payable and long term obligations 
the company repaid a significant portion of the borrowings under the antilliana credit agreement with borrowings under the bank credit agreement during the second half of cash used for operating activities for the year ended december  was 
million 
the company generated cash flows of million from net income and million from non cash depreciation and amortization charges 
the cash flow was used to finance its net cash needs of million for other operating activities 
an increase in accounts receivable accounted for million of these needs 
the increase in accounts receivable was attributable to higher sales levels in the us and europe 
other significant cash requirements in included million for the repayment of amounts due under the credit facility with knp bt and its affiliates  million related to acquisitions  million for capital expenditures and 
million for the net repayment of notes payable and long term obligations 
remaining cash for these activities and other uses of funds were provided by the million capital contribution and the net proceeds of the offering 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
the company generated cash flows for million from non cash depreciation and amortization charges offset by a net loss of 
million

the increase in trade receivable was attributable to higher sales levels as days sales outstanding remained constant at days 
the changes from year to year in accounts receivable and inventories are also impacted by the timing of acquisitions and exchange rate fluctuations in translating foreign currency balances into us dollars

the company has budgeted aggregate capital expenditures of million for the year ending december  excluding any expenditures relating to recent acquisitions 
these budgeted expenditures primarily relate to investments in information technology systems  costs associated with its business process reengineering and improvements to existing distribution centers 
the company believes that internally generated funds and available borrowings under its credit agreements will be sufficient to meet its presently anticipated cash requirements for capital expenditures and working capital 
however  since the offering in july  the company has relied principally upon its debt facilities  the most significant of which is currently the million bank credit agreement  to finance acquisitions 
total borrowings under the bank credit agreement at december  were million 
the most restrictive covenant in the bank credit agreement currently limits  and may in the future limit  the company s ability to fully utilize the available capacity remaining under the bank credit agreement and other credit facilities of the company 
while the company continues to seek acquisition candidates on a selective basis  it is expected that the level of acquisition activity in the first half of will be limited  as the focus will be on integrating the acquired companies 
the company anticipates significant future acquisition funding  to the extent required  will necessitate obtaining additional debt and or equity capital resources 
the company is presently examining and evaluating several alternatives 
effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates approximately of the company s operating revenues and operating expenses are generated from its european operations and are denominated in a variety of currencies other than united states dollars 
each of the company s european operations conducts substantially all of its business in its local currency with minimal cross border product movement 
as a result  these operations are not subject to material operational risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company s results of operations  however  are impacted by the translation rate of the european operations currencies into united states dollars 
additionally  because the company intends to expand the size and scope of its international operations  this exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates will be increased 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the company s results of operations will not be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
although the company currently does not engage in any activities with respect to hedging its exposure to such fluctuations  it may consider engaging in such efforts in the future 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its business or results of operations in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future
