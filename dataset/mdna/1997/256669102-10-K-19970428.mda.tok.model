the company improved its timely distribution of merchandise to stores which led to improved in stock levels for basic merchandise 
the company s primary merchandising objectives in were to lower store inventories  reduce hanging apparel and create additional space for more consumable items 
the company was successful in achieving these objectives 
in  average store inventory decreased by while average store softlines inventory decreased on a flat sales comparison of softlines sales compared with the prior year 
customer demand continues to dictate an intensified focus on everyday low pricing and consumable basic merchandise  which resulted in the company s sales mix further shifting to hardlines from softlines during the year hardlines softlines in  hardlines softlines in  hardlines softlines in 
management believes that during the sales mix should continue to shift toward hardlines 
in response  the company has designed a new store layout and product mix 
the new store layout reflects a hardlines to softlines space allocation versus the current allocation 
the new store layout allocates more space to the faster moving consumable merchandise

inventory shrinkage declined to of net sales from in management attributes much of the improvement to a reduction in excess inventories and implementation of several shrinkage reduction programs 
the company will continue these programs in the company will also initiate cycle inventories in  permitting the booking of actual inventory shrinkage throughout the year instead of only at year end 
this process should allow for the early identification of adverse trends that can be addressed immediately 
in august  the federal minimum wage law was changed to increase minimum wage from per hour to per hour effective october  and from per hour to per hour effective september  the company estimates that this change resulted in an increase in wage expense  above otherwise expected levels  of approximately to million for and will result in an approximate million increase in wage expense in the company believes the financial impact of the minimum wage increase to operations for was partially offset by increased sales and employee productivity  and those factors will continue to partially offset the estimated increase in wage expense 
the following table sets forth certain items in the consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated

based upon anticipated net new store growth and same store sales increases for  management anticipates net sales growth in to be comparable with and gross profit gross profit for was million  compared with million in and million in gross profit as a percent to net sales was for  for  and for the lower margin percent in resulted primarily from the further shift in sales mix to hardlines along with continued lower prices  which was partially offset by significantly lower store inventory shrinkage

selling  general and administrative expense for was million  with million  or of net sales in and million or of net sales  in total selling  general and administrative expense increased  primarily from opening and operating net new stores 
the lower operating expense ratio achieved in resulted from i improved labor productivity and store level controls  ii lower advertising costs through the elimination of the back to school direct mail circular  and iii lower self insurance expense primarily the result of improved claims prevention and management 
partially offsetting these improvements were increases to the company s incentive bonus costs 
all other expense categories remained relatively flat as a percent of sales 
total selling  general and administrative expense for increased primarily from opening and operating net new stores 
the net operating expense to net sales ratio in was the result of a reduction in employee incentive based compensation expense reflecting lower performance levels  lower advertising costs and lower self insurance expense 
these reductions were partially offset by higher depreciation related to accelerated new store openings and higher rent expense as a percent of sales resulting from lower than anticipated sales volumes 
interest expense in  interest expense decreased to million as compared with interest expense of million in and million in this significant decrease was primarily the result of lower average short term borrowings throughout the year caused by lower inventory levels  which required less merchandise to be financed through short term borrowings

net cash used by operating activities was million in compared with net cash provided by operations of million in in  cash used to purchase merchandise inventories increased by million while accounts payable decreased million  more than offsetting cash generated from net income including cash from depreciation and amortization 
the higher inventory level was the result of net new stores openings  and slower inventory turns as a result of distribution inefficiencies and lower than expected sales volumes in cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures in totaled million compared with million in and million in the company opened new stores and relocated or remodeled stores at a cost of million in capital expenditures during and for new  relocated and remodeled stores totaled million and million  respectively

earnings per share for the year ended january  this accounting pronouncement requires the disclosure of basic and diluted earnings per share 
the company believes that  upon adoption  diluted earnings per share will approximate earnings per share as previously reported 
because the concept of basic earnings per share does not include the impact of common stock equivalents  such as preferred stock and stock options  basic earnings per share will be significantly higher than diluted earnings per share
