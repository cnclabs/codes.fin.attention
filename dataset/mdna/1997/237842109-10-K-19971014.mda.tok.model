item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth for the fiscal years indicated the percentage of total revenue represented by items reflected in the company s statements of operations 
percentage of total percentage revenue for fiscal years increase decrease ended june  from prior year operating statement data total revenue cost of revenue gross profit loss operating expenses engineering and product development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net income loss before income tax income tax expense benefit net income loss not meaningful from its inception in  the company has designed  manufactured and marketed advanced technology communication products 
the company s strategy is to provide innovative  early to market  high value added solutions to meet the needs of knowledge workers remote from their headquarters office 
historically  sales of custom modem products to notebook computer manufacturers have represented a large portion of the company s total revenue 
the number of notebook computer manufacturers is relatively small  and the number of new notebook computers introduced each year which utilize custom modems are limited 
therefore  the company s custom modem sales are characterized by a small number of contracts  often with gaps between the expiration of one contract and the commencement of another 
to the extent that such gaps continue  the company anticipates large fluctuations in the company s revenue from custom modems 
custom modem products generally yield lower gross margins than the company has historically achieved from its network multiplexer products 
the company and its competitors typically bid for jobs at prices which yield very low initial margins  relying on rapid decreases in component costs to increase the margin to acceptable levels over the life of the contract 
in contrast to the higher gross margin network multiplexer products  the company has historically incurred lower sales and marketing expenses to support the custom modem products 
the company s goal of returning to profitability and developing a more dependable revenue base depends to a large extent on the success of the be there personal multiplexer system 
the be there system represents a new type of product for the company which is significantly different from the company s custom modem and network multiplexer products 
although the company has not recorded significant revenue from sales of the be there system  the company has expended substantial resources on its development and introduction 
in order to successfully penetrate the emerging teleworker market  the company expects that significant additional resources will need to be expended in order to expand its sales and marketing infrastructure and operational systems  and to finance inventory and receivables

the company believes that custom modem revenue  if any  will continue to be characterized by a small number of large contracts  each typically with volume deliveries over a short period 
the active market life of a notebook computer has continued to shorten and is now typically six months or less 
to the extent to which there continue to be gaps between the completion of one contract and the commencement of another  the company anticipates large fluctuations in revenue from custom modems 
as long as the custom modem business continues to dominate the company s revenue  the company anticipates continued fluctuation between periods of profit and loss from custom modem products
