for a discussion of important factors that could affect the company s results  please refer to the business section and financial statement line item discussions set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
summary cyberonics was founded in to design  develop and bring to market medical devices which provide a novel therapy  vagus nerve stimulation  for the treatment of epilepsy and other debilitating neurological disorders 
clinical trials of the ncp system began with the first patient implant in november under an ide from the fda 
the company received fda approval to market the ncp system in the united states in july for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over twelve years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to aeds 
from inception through july  the company s primary focus was on obtaining fda approval for the ncp system 
the company has had minimal revenues to date  primarily consisting of sales to clinical investigators and international sales  and has been unprofitable since inception 
since inception  the company has incurred substantial expenses  primarily for research and development activities including product and process development and clinical trials and related regulatory activities  sales and marketing activities and manufacturing start up 
for the period from inception through june   the company incurred a cumulative net deficit of approximately million 
cyberonics was granted regulatory approval in to market and sell the ncp system in the member countries of the european union and also has permission to sell in certain other international markets 
however  through fiscal  the company devoted only limited resources to marketing and sales activities internationally  and only in early fiscal began initiating significant marketing and sales activities 
international sales of the ncp system have been limited to date 
cyberonics is engaged in obtaining reimbursement approvals from the various health care provider systems in the united states and in key international markets  and has received reimbursement approvals from certain payment authorities in a limited number of international markets 
the company does not expect to achieve significant sales unless and until additional reimbursement approvals are obtained for the ncp system 
the company expects to incur substantial costs related to sales and marketing activities associated with united states and international market entry  expansion of manufacturing capabilities  clinical trials and regulatory activities and product and process development 
it is expected that there will be a significant delay between the increased levels of spending and any resulting increase in revenues 
accordingly  the company expects to remain unprofitable through at least the fiscal year ending june  there can be no assurance that the company will become profitable after that time or  that if it becomes profitable  it will remain so in future periods 
furthermore  the company s results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and will depend upon numerous factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the extent to which the company s ncp system gains market acceptance  any approvals for reimbursement by third party payors  the rate and size of expenditures incurred as the company expands its sales and marketing efforts  availability of key components  materials and contract services which may be dependent on the company s ability to forecast sales and ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and costs 
results of operations net sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended june  totaled million compared to million and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the substantial majority of sales in each period presented were derived from international markets where the company had regulatory approval to sell the ncp system 
through fiscal  domestic sales have depended entirely upon the company s conducting clinical trial activities under arrangements with certain investigational centers  some of which receive research funding from the company 
domestic sales made in connection with such clinical studies have been limited to date and  in certain cases  have been made pursuant to risk sharing provisions 
sales made under risk sharing arrangements are deferred until cyberonics receives payment from the centers and the centers in turn receive third party reimbursement or satisfy other terms set forth in their respective arrangements 
international sales were million  million and  in fiscal  and  respectively  while domestic sales  net of risk sharing provisions  were   and  in such periods 
in july  the company received fda approval to market the ncp system in the united states 
although the company may utilize risk sharing arrangements in connection with clinical trials for additional indications for the ncp system  the company expects that such revenues will not represent a material component of its net sales in any future period 
while the company currently has regulatory approval to sell the ncp system in the united states and in a number of significant key international markets  significant increases in sales will be dependent upon achieving market acceptance for the ncp system and upon obtaining reimbursement approval in key markets 
gross profit 
cost of sales consist primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead and the acquisition cost of raw materials and components 
in addition  the company is obligated to pay royalties ranging from to on the first million in cumulative net sales  and from to thereafter 
expenses related to royalty obligations under the company s license agreements totaled  during each of the years ended june   and  and will continue at or above this level in future years 
the company will include substantially all royalties in cost of sales in future periods 
the company s gross margin percentage was for the year ended june  compared to and for fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal increase is attributable primarily to a shift in international sales mix toward markets where the company sells its products directly  resulting in higher average selling prices and consequently  higher gross margins 
gross margin percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based upon the mix between direct and distributor sales  the ncp system s selling price and the levels of production volume 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses are comprised of both expenses related to the company s product and process development efforts and expenses associated with conducting clinical trials and certain related regulatory activities 
research and development expenses totaled million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
the company s research and development spending decreased during fiscal as the company completed its confirmatory clinical trial 
the increased level of research and development expenditures in over was due primarily to the costs associated with the company s confirmatory clinical trial which was at its peak level of activity during fiscal the company intends to conduct clinical trials of the ncp system for additional indications both within and outside the field of epilepsy 
accordingly  the company expects research and development expenses to fluctuate in future periods depending primarily upon the level of clinical trial activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
the continued increases from year to year were primarily due to expanded international market development activities and  during the second half of fiscal  preparations for united states product launch 
the company began expanding its sales and marketing staff in late calendar and early to more actively pursue international sales and in anticipation of fda approval in the united states and expects to add further sales and marketing personnel during fiscal the company also expects to add administrative personnel in anticipation of higher levels of business activity 
accordingly  the company expects its sales  general and administrative expenses to increase substantially in absolute amount over the fiscal level 
interest income  net 
net interest income totaled   and  during the years ended june   and  respectively 
interest income increased in fiscal over fiscal as a result of higher average cash and investment balances during fiscal due to investment of the proceeds from private placements of common stock completed during fiscal the decrease in interest income in compared to resulted from lower average cash and investment balances available for investment during other expense income  net 
other income expense totaled   and  during the three years ended june   and  respectively 
for each of these years  other income expense consisted of net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency fluctuations 
income taxes 
at june   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million which expire during the years through  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes which expire during the years through due to its net operating loss history  to date the company has established a valuation allowance to fully offset its deferred tax assets  including those related to its carryforwards  resulting in no income tax benefit for financial reporting purposes 
current federal income tax regulations with respect to changes in ownership could limit the utilization of the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through february  the company financed its operations primarily through private placements of its securities through which it raised approximately million in net proceeds 
in february  the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of its common stock  generating net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
in july  the company raised an additional million in net proceeds in a sale of  shares of its common stock to st 
jude and  in march  the company raised an additional approximately million in a sale of  shares of its common stock in a private placement 
additionally  through june   the company has funded approximately  of its equipment needs with proceeds from an equipment lease agreement 
the company had no short or long term borrowings outstanding at june   and had no credit facilities available at that time 
the company expects to incur substantial additional costs related to sales and marketing activities associated with united states and international market entry  expansion of manufacturing capabilities  clinical trials and regulatory activities and product and process development 
the amount and timing of anticipated expenditures will depend upon numerous factors both within and outside of the company s control  including the nature and timing of marketing and sales activities and the nature and timing of additional clinical trials for additional indications  both within and outside the field of epilepsy 
moreover  the company s ability to generate income from operations will be dependent upon obtaining reimbursement approval from government and third party payors as well as receiving market acceptance for the ncp system 
during fiscal  the company used approximately million in cash in operating activities 
during the fiscal year  inventories increased to million from  at june  as the company built inventory levels in anticipation of higher levels of manufacturing and sales activities 
during fiscal  the company raised approximately million from the sale of common stock in two private placement transactions  one of which approximately million was completed in july and the other approximately million was completed in march the company s liquidity will continue to be reduced as amounts are expended for expansion of sales and marketing activities  manufacturing expansion  continuing clinical trials and related regulatory affairs  and product and process development 
although the company has no firm commitments  the company expects to make capital expenditures of approximately million during the remainder of fiscal and approximately million in fiscal  primarily to expand manufacturing capabilities and to enhance general infrastructure and facilities 
the company believes that its current resources  combined with the proceeds from an anticipated public offering of common stock  will be sufficient to fund its operations at least through june  this estimate is based on certain assumptions  which may not hold true  including the timely completion of a financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be completed on a timely basis  or at all  or that proceeds from such financing  if any  combined with the company s available cash  cash equivalents  investment securities and investment income  will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements through june  the availability of financing either before or after that time will depend upon a number of important factors  including the state of the united states capital markets and economy in general and the health care and medical device segments in particular  the status of the company s international and domestic sales activities and the status of the company s clinical and regulatory activities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital when needed or that the terms upon which capital will be available will be favorable to the company 
impact of new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements 
factors affecting future operating results reliance on single product 
the company has only one product  the ncp system  which has been approved by the fda only for a single indication as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over twelve years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic drugs aeds 
the company does not expect to have any other product or approved indication for the ncp system for the foreseeable future 
although the company has been able to sell the ncp system in certain countries in europe since and recently received united states fda approval and canadian approval  it is only now in the process of initiating full scale marketing and sales efforts in the united states and other countries 
the company s inability to commercialize successfully the ncp system would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of market acceptance 
although the ncp system was approved for commercial sale in a number of european countries beginning in  the company has sold  through june   a limited number of ncp systems 
market acceptance of the company s ncp system will depend on the company s ability to convince the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation and the ncp system  and on the approval and availability of adequate levels of reimbursement 
while the ncp system has been used in approximately  patients through june   it provides a new form of therapy with which many physicians are unfamiliar 
the company believes that existing aeds and surgery are the only other approved and currently available therapies competitive with the ncp system in the treatment of epileptic seizures 
such therapies may be more attractive to patients or their physicians than the ncp system in terms of efficacy  cost or reimbursement availability 
there can be no assurance that the ncp system will achieve market acceptance for the treatment of epilepsy or for any other indication or that adequate levels of reimbursement from governmental or third party payors will be available 
failure of the ncp system to gain market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
history of losses  profitability uncertain  fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company has incurred net losses and accumulated a deficit of approximately million through june  in july  the company received fda marketing approval which permits the company to sell the ncp system in the united states for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of refractory partial onset seizures in patients over twelve years of age 
in addition  the company has obtained ce marking  the designation of market approval now accepted by all european union member countries  for its ncp system which  when combined with approvals from canada and certain other countries  permits the company to sell the ncp system internationally 
even with these marketing approvals  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate adequate sales to achieve profitability in the future 
in addition  in order to develop these markets  the company will incur substantial marketing and sales expenses 
the amount and timing of anticipated expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the nature and timing of marketing and sales activities  the expansion of the company s manufacturing capabilities  the nature and timing of additional clinical trials  and the company s product development efforts 
the company s results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and will depend upon numerous factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the extent to which the company s ncp system gains market acceptance  timing of any approvals for reimbursement by third party payors  the rate and size of expenditures occurred as the company expands its sales and marketing efforts and availability of key components  materials and contract services which may be dependent on the company s ability to forecast sales 
limitations on third party reimbursement 
the company s ability to commercialize the ncp system successfully will depend in part on whether third party payors  including private healthcare insurers  managed care plans  the united states government s medicare and medicaid programs  and others  agree both to cover the ncp system  and the procedures and services associated with the ncp system  and to reimburse adequately for the costs of the ncp system and the related services 
in deciding to cover a new therapy  third party payors base their initial coverage decisions on several factors  including  but not limited to  the status of the fda s review of the product  the product s safety and efficacy  the number of studies performed and peer reviewed articles published with respect to the product  and how the product and therapy compares to alternative therapies 
there can be no assurance that third party payors will view the company and the ncp system favorably with respect to any of the above factors  which may impede the company s obtaining favorable coverage decisions on a timely basis  or at all 
the company has only limited experience in seeking and obtaining coverage decisions from third party payors 
a failure to achieve favorable coverage decisions for the ncp system in a timely manner could deter patients and their physicians from using the ncp system and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
once a favorable coverage determination is made with respect to a product  payors must determine the level of reimbursement for the product and related therapy and procedures 
the company believes that coverage and reimbursement for most epilepsy patients who may be implanted with the ncp system will need to be obtained from third party private payors 
in making decisions about reimbursement amounts  third party private payors typically reimburse for the costs of newly covered devices and services using the standard methods they employ for other products and services already covered 
many private insurers and managed care plans use a variety of payment mechanisms  including  but not limited to  discounted charges  per diem amounts  resource based payment scales and reimbursed costs 
the company believes that a significant number of epilepsy patients in the united states are either eligible for benefits under the medicare program or are uninsured 
the medicare program uses a fixed payment method based on diagnosis related groups or drgs to pay for hospital inpatient services and uses a resource based relative value scale to pay for physicians services 
under current drg groupings  hospital inpatient procedures for implanting the ncp system are assigned to one of two different drgs based on whether or not the patient has complications or comorbidities coexisting severe medical problems 
the drg grouping that would include implantation of the ncp system for patients without complications or comorbidities pay hospitals less than the costs of purchasing and implanting the ncp system 
the company believes that this drg grouping would apply to most of the epilepsy patients covered by medicare 
in order to assure adequate reimbursement for all epileptic patients eligible for benefits under medicare  the company intends to seek changes in the drg grouping so that ncp system implant cases would be reclassified to other  higher paying drgs 
the company has only limited experience in seeking and obtaining coverage and payment approvals from third party payors  and there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in achieving coverage or adequate reimbursement levels  or any  or that it can obtain new drg assignments under the medicare program to cover the complete costs of therapy using the ncp system 
if the company is unsuccessful in achieving coverage or adequate reimbursement levels or in obtaining new drg assignments  or if hospitals or physicians view their payments as inadequate  then patients  physicians and hospitals could be deterred from using the ncp system  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
see business third party reimbursement 
limited marketing and sales experience 
although the company has had approval to market the ncp system in the member countries of the european union since  it has only recently received fda approval to commercialize the ncp system in the united states and  consequently  it has limited experience in marketing  direct sales and distribution 
the company has recently established a marketing and sales force for the united states market  but no assurance can be given that the company s direct marketing and sales force will succeed in promoting the ncp system to patients  health care providers or third party payors 
the company believes that  to market its products directly  it must employ a marketing and sales force with technical expertise 
in addition  due to the limited market awareness of the ncp system  the company believes that the sales process could be lengthy  requiring the company to educate patients  health care providers and third party payors regarding the clinical benefits of the ncp system 
in addition  in certain international territories  the company relies  and intends to continue relying  upon independent distributors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit and retain skilled marketing and sales personnel or foreign distributors  or that the company s marketing efforts will be successful 
failure by the company to market successfully the ncp system would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business marketing and sales 
limited manufacturing experience 
the company has a limited history of operations that  to date  has consisted primarily of manufacturing limited quantities of the ncp system for clinical investigations and for commercial sales activities in international markets 
the company does not have experience manufacturing the ncp system in the volumes that will be necessary to achieve significant commercial sales 
the company is currently negotiating a lease for a new facility  and intends to move all of its manufacturing operations to the new facility  which is expected to begin production in early calendar the company may encounter difficulties in scaling up production of the ncp system  in procuring the necessary supply of materials  components and contract services  or in hiring and training additional manufacturing personnel to support domestic and international demand 
the company will be required to obtain fda approval for this change in the manufacturing facility 
the new manufacturing facility will also have to be inspected for compliance with the fda s quality system regulations qsr and iso and standards  which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements with respect to device design  development  manufacturing and quality assurance activities  before the company can begin commercial scale production of the ncp system at the new manufacturing facility 
in addition  one of the company s contract manufacturers has moved its manufacturing operations to a new facility 
the company will be required to obtain fda approval for the change in the location of the contractor s manufacturing facility  which generally requires a preapproval inspection by the fda to determine the contractor s compliance with the qsr 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the necessary fda and other approvals for its or its contract manufacturers new facilities on a timely basis  or at all 
if the company is unable to achieve commercial scale production capability on a timely basis with acceptable quality and manufacturing yield and costs  to sustain such capacity  or to achieve fda and other governmental approvals  the ability of the company to deliver products on a timely basis could be impaired which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
see business manufacturing and sources of supply 
dependence on key suppliers and manufacturers 
the company relies upon sole source suppliers for certain of the key components  materials and contract services used in manufacturing the ncp system 
the company periodically experiences discontinuation or unavailability of components  materials and contract services which may require qualification of alternative sources or  if no such alternative sources are identified  product design changes 
the company believes that pursuing and qualifying alternative sources and or redesigning specific components of the ncp system  when necessary  could consume significant company resources 
in addition  such changes generally require regulatory submissions and approvals 
any extended delays in or inability to secure alternative sources for these or other components  materials and contract services could result in product supply and manufacturing interruptions 
these delays could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture the ncp system on a timely and cost competitive basis  and therefore on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
see business manufacturing and sources of supply 
risk of product recall 
the ncp system includes a complex electronic device and lead designed to be implanted in the human body 
component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects could result in an unsafe condition in patients 
the occurrence of such problems or other adverse reactions could result in a recall of the company s products  possibly requiring removal and potentially reimplantation of ncp generators and or leads 
in  a failure of an ncp system caused permanent paralysis of one patient s left vocal cord 
in addition  several patients experienced vagus nerve lead failures which  although not harmful to the patient  reduced the efficacy of the treatment and required replacement 
since the occurrence of these failures  changes have been made to the company s product designs and no similar failures have been reported to the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not experience similar or other product problems or that the company will not be required to recall products 
any product recall could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
see business clinical trials and government regulation 
dependence on patents  licenses and proprietary rights 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for the ncp system and its improvements  and for vagus nerve stimulation therapy 
to that end  the company has acquired licenses under certain patents and intends to seek patents on its own inventions used in its products and treatment methods 
the process of seeking patent protection can be expensive and time consuming and there can be no assurance that patents will issue from the currently pending or future applications or that  if patents are issued  they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection of the company s technology  or any commercial advantage to the company 
cyberonics believes that the licenses held by the company provide it with protection in the united states in the field of cranial nerve stimulation  including vagus nerve stimulation for the control of epilepsy  movement disorders  including parkinson s disease and essential tremor  and additional indications for which method patents have been issued 
the protection offered by the licensed international patents is not as strong as that offered by the licensed united states patents due to differences in patent laws 
in particular  the european patent convention prohibits patents covering methods for treatment of the human body by surgery or therapy 
in addition  there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by the company  may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to the company  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by the company or to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  could require the company to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent the company from manufacturing  selling or using the ncp system  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that any required license would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
see business patents  licenses and proprietary rights 
competition  rapid technological change 
the company believes that existing and future aeds will be the primary competition for its ncp system 
the company may also face competition from other medical device companies for the treatment of partial seizures 
medtronic  inc has clinically assessed an implantable signal generator used with an invasive deep brain probe thalamic stimulation for the treatment of neurological disorders and has received fda approval for the device for the treatment of essential tremor  including that associated with parkinson s disease 
the company could also face competition from other large medical device companies which have the technology  experience and capital resources to develop alternative devices for the treatment of epilepsy 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than the company and have obtained third party reimbursement approvals 
in addition  the health care industry is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not develop technologies and obtain regulatory approval for products that are more effective in treating epilepsy than the company s current or future products 
there can also be no assurance that advancements in surgical techniques will not make surgery a more attractive therapy for epilepsy 
the development by others of new treatment methods with novel aeds  medical devices or surgical techniques for epilepsy could render the ncp system non competitive or obsolete 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competition  including the development and commercialization of new products and technology  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
see business competition 
management of growth 
in connection with the commercialization of the ncp system in the united states  the company has begun and intends to continue to significantly expand the scope of its operations  in particular in manufacturing  marketing and sales 
such activities have placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on the company s resources and operations 
the company s ability to effectively manage such growth will depend upon its ability to attract  hire and retain highly qualified employees and management personnel 
the company competes for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
the company s success will also depend on the ability of its officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve its operational  management information and financial control systems  of which there can be no assurance 
the company s inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
see business employees 
product liability and availability of insurance 
the manufacture and sale of the ncp system entails the risk of product liability claims 
although the company maintains product liability insurance  there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of the company s insurance policies will be adequate 
such insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against the company in excess of its insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
see business product liability and insurance 
government regulation 
the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion of the ncp system are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation in the united states by federal agencies  primarily the fda  and by comparable state agencies 
the ncp system is regulated as a medical device by the fda and is subject to the fda s premarket approval pma requirements 
in july  the company received fda approval to market the ncp system in the united states for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over twelve years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to aeds 
nonetheless  in the future  it will be necessary for the company to file pma supplements  and apply for additional regulatory approvals  possibly including new investigational device exemptions ides and additional pmas  for other applications of the ncp system and for modified or future generation products 
commercial distribution in certain foreign countries is also subject to obtaining regulatory approvals from the appropriate authorities in such countries 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
moreover  regulatory approvals may include regulatory restrictions on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  fines  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  confiscations or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
furthermore  changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations could prevent the company from obtaining  or affect the timing of  future regulatory approvals 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional future regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such future approvals  suspension or withdrawal of previously received approvals  or recalls of the ncp system could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
see business government regulation 
future capital requirements 
although the company believes that its current resources  together with the proceeds from an anticipated public offering of common stock  will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements at least through june   there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing either before or after that date 
this estimate is based on certain assumptions  which may not hold true  including the timely completion of a financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be completed on a timely basis  or at all  or that proceeds from such financing  if any  combined with company s available cash  cash equivalents  investment securities and investment income  will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements through june  the company s future capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the extent and timing of future product sales  the scale up of the company s manufacturing facilities  and the nature  timing and success of clinical trials for additional indications for the ncp system 
such financing  if required  may not be available on satisfactory terms  or at all 
lack of access to sufficient financing would impair the company s ability to fully pursue its business objectives  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks associated with international operations 
although the ncp system has been approved for commercialization in the european union countries since  the company has not generated significant revenues from such countries to date 
the company currently is expanding its marketing and sales activities in international markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully increase international sales or that the company will be successful in obtaining reimbursement or any regulatory approvals required in foreign countries 
changes in overseas economic conditions  currency exchange rates  foreign tax laws  or tariffs or other trade regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the anticipated international nature of the company s business is also expected to subject the company and its representatives  agents and distributors to laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdictions in which they operate or where the ncp system is sold 
the regulation of medical devices in a number of such jurisdictions  particularly in the european union  continues to develop and there can be no assurance that new laws or regulations will not have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in particular  the european patent convention prohibits patents covering methods for the treatment of the human body by surgery or therapy
