item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the financial statements and notes thereto of the company included herein 
overview datastream was incorporated in to develop  market  sell and support software products for the industrial automation market 
the company s revenues have grown each calendar year since inception 
excluding the one time charges related to the acquisition of sql  datastream has been profitable in each of the last six years and has experienced a compounded annual growth rate of in revenues and in earnings during that period 
the company offers a family of cmms products to the mro industry 
these products currently consist of mp dos released june  sidearm dos released december  sidearm for windows released september  mp for windows released april  maintainit released august  the datastream personal maintenance assistant on apple newton released august  mp for windows client server oracle released november  mp for windows and nt released june  maintainit pro released september  and mp for windows client server microsoft sql server released in beta  december 
to enable more rapid international expansion  datastream introduced a spanish language version of mp for windows in september and a german language version of mp for windows in september through the company s acquisition of sql in december  the company now also offers sql s r camms product 
datastream and sql support their software products through applications engineering and support services 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition 
see note c of the company s financial statements for additional information concerning the company s revenue recognition policies 
until  the company concentrated its resources on developing microsoft dos windows compatible software for use on standalone computers or pc network systems 
recently  development efforts have focused on introducing enterprise wide windows client server products for oracle and microsoft sql server 
product development costs consist principally of salaries and certain other expenses related to development and modification of software products  which are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
statement  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
capitalization of such costs begins only upon establishment of technological feasibility as defined in the statement and ends when the resulting product is available for distribution 
annual amortization of capitalized product development costs is provided at the greater of the ratio of current product revenue to the total of current and anticipated product revenue or on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the software  which is not more than eighteen months or three years  depending on the product 
revenues from sales outside the united states were negligible until  when international revenues reached of total revenues 
international revenues increased to of total revenues in  and in management expects that international revenues will continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues  primarily as a result of the acquisition of sql  but also due to datastream s own internal expansion efforts 
on a pro forma basis  revenues adjusted for the inclusion of sql would have been approximately million 
of that figure  approximately would have been derived from international sources 
as the company begins to accept increased payments in foreign currency  changes in the values of these foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar may affect the company s results of operations and affect its financial position 
in addition  gains and losses on currency translations could contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
because the company consummated the acquisition of sql on the last day of fiscal and was accounted for as a purchase  sql s results of operations for the year are not included in the company s results 
for  sql generated revenues of approximately million and a net loss of approximately million 
the company s efforts to integrate and rationalize sql s operations are well underway  and although no assurance to this effect can be given management believes it can manage sql to profitability in however  the acquisition of sql has impacted and will continue to impact the reporting control and management capabilities of the company in see safe harbor statement impact of sql acquisition

total revenues for increased to approximately million from approximately million in  due principally to a number of factors 
these factors include continued acceptance of the company s products in the industrial automation market  expansion of the company s sales  applications engineering and technical support service organizations  introduction of mp for windows nt in june  introduction of maintainitpro in september  increased demand for the client server version of mp for windows in the industrial automation market  and the addition of sales personnel and marketing resources to support the company s telesales and direct sales programs 
total revenues for increased to approximately million from approximately million in  due principally to introduction of the client server version of mp for windows in september  increased demand for mp for windows in the industrial automation market  and introduction of maintainit in september international revenues were approximately million  or of total revenues in  compared to approximately million  or of total revenues  in and million  or of revenues in management anticipates that international revenues will continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues as a result of the expansion of datastream s international sales efforts and sales of sql s product to its customer base  which is predominantly international in nature 
product revenues increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  and to approximately million in from approximately million in these increases are due to growth in the number of software units sold  and an increase in the average selling price of the systems sold 
as a percentage of revenues  revenues from software products decreased to in from in and in applications engineering revenues increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  and to approximately million in from approximately million in these increases generally reflect increased installation  training and integration services provided to support increased product sales 
as a percentage of revenues  revenues from applications engineering services increased to in from in and in management expects this trend to continue  partly as a result of sales of high end cmms systems by sql 
technical support services increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  and to approximately million in from approximately million in these increases reflect an increase in the type and variety of services offered as well as additional services provided to a larger installed customer base 
as a percentage of total revenues  revenues from technical support services decreased to in from in and in cost of revenues 
cost of product revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in  and decreased to in from in the increase as a percentage of revenues in from principally reflects increased amortization of capitalized software costs as a percentage of product costs 
the decrease as a percentage of revenues in from principally reflects decreased costs associated with printing and replication of the company s software products and volume discounts realized on shipping costs 
cost of product revenues is expected to decrease as a percentage of revenues in for two reasons related to the acquisition of sql  the write off of approximately million in capitalized software rendered obsolete or redundant upon the acquisition of sql and the smaller component of product cost reflected in sql s product revenues 
cost of applications engineering services increased as a percentage of total revenues to in from in and decreased to in from in the increase as a percentage of revenues in from was due primarily to lower utilization of application engineers during the second half of the year resulting from increased hiring to support planned services growth 
the decrease as a percentage of revenues in from was due primarily to increased utilization of engineers providing services and fewer sales of third party hardware  offset in part by higher customer reimbursed travel expenses 
cost of application engineering services revenues is expected to increase as a percentage of revenues in due to the acquisition of sql 
cost of technical support services as a percentage of total revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to as a percentage of revenues reflects the cost efficiencies achieved from providing support services to a larger customer base  and improved quality of the software and associated documentation 
cost of technical support services revenues is expected to increase as a percentage of revenues in due to the acquisition of sql 
cost of revenue includes a million write off of capitalized software  of total revenues  which became obsolete as a result of the acquisition of sql see note i to the consolidated financial statements 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for increased to approximately million from approximately million in  and to million in from approximately million in as a percentage of total revenues  these expenses were in  in and in the increase as a percentage of revenues in from was due primarily to increased commissions and sales travel expenses 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue in from was due primarily to increased productivity of the company s sales and marketing staffs combined with increased market acceptance of the company s products 
product development expenses 
total expenditures on product development  including capitalized expenses  increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  and from approximately million in the increases were primarily due to the hiring of additional employees and third party consultants to work on the company s file server  client server  maintainit pro and foreign language products 
the company capitalized software expense of approximately million  
million  and 
million  respectively  in  and  which represented  and of total expenditures for product development in the respective periods 
capitalization of software expense is expected to decrease as a percentage of total development expense in because the majority of projects qualifying for capitalization have been released or will be released for revenue shipments in early net product development expenditures were approximately million  million and 
million in  and  respectively 
net product development expenses as a percentage of revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
amortization of capitalized product development costs is charged to cost of product sales and totaled approximately 
million  
million and 
million in  and  respectively 
management believes that these capitalized software assets will be recoverable out of future product sales 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include the cost of the company s finance  human resources and information services 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in from million in  and increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  due primarily to increased administrative personnel required to support the company s growth  increased reserves and increased expenses associated with being a public company 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were in  in and in the steady decline from to indicates that the company has managed a larger revenue base without commensurate increases in general and administrative expenses 
write off of in process research and development costs 
the company expensed million of in process research and development acquired in as part of the acquisition of sql 
this one time charge resulted in the company reporting a loss in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other income expense 
other income expense increased million in to approximately million from approximately million in  and approximately  in  due to the interest earned on higher investment balances realized upon completion of two public offerings of common stock in april and october  respectively 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate for decreased to due to the tax treatment of the acquisition related costs 
without the effect of the acquisition  the company s effective tax rate for would have decreased to due principally to increased product development tax credits 
the company s effective income tax rate increased to for from for  due principally to decreased product development tax credits in net income loss 
the company s net income decreased in to a loss of approximately million or per share  from approximately million  or 
per share in  and increased in to approximately million  or 
per share  from approximately million  or 
per share  in the loss in is directly attributable to the one time write off of costs associated with the acquisition of sql 
before accounting for the one time charges associated with the acquisition  the company s net income increased to million in quarterly results general 
many software companies experience seasonal variations in revenues 
the company has experienced eighteen consecutive quarters of increasing total revenues 
although this growth does not reflect seasonal variations in the company s operating results  the company believes that its future results of operations may be subject to quarterly variations 
datastream has historically experienced an increase in revenues in the quarter q and q during which the company holds its annual technical user group conference 
the next such conference is presently scheduled to be held in may although no assurance of such an increase in can be given 
the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the eight quarters through the quarter ended december  in the opinion of management  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k report and all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the company and notes thereto 
the company s quarterly results have in the past been subject to fluctuations  and thus the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

net other income income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its operations through a combination of private equity financing  bank loans and lines of credit  and  beginning in  through cash flows from operations 
in  and operating activities generated cash totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively  primarily related to increases in net income  in and and increases in net income before acquisition related charges in in  and  the company used cash from investing activities of approximately million  million and million primarily related to the purchase of short term investments  additions to property  plant and equipment and additions to capitalized software development costs 
the company completed its initial public offering in april  raising net proceeds of approximately million  and a second public offering in october  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds of these offerings were invested in us government securities 
the company maintains a bank line of credit that provides for borrowings of of accounts receivable less than days aged up to million 
this line expires on may  no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit at december  the acquisition of sql was completed for million  million in cash  million in stock issued pursuant to regulation s  million in escrowed stock  and assumption of outstanding liabilities 
following the acquisition  sql long term debt totaling approximately million was repaid by the company and additional working capital infusions of approximately million were required to sustain sql s operations and pay current liabilities 
approximately million of sql s long term debt remains  of which approximately  is scheduled to be repaid by the end of the company s principal commitments as of december  consisted primarily of leases on its headquarters facilities and operating equipment  and there were no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company believes that its current cash balances  availability under its line of credit and cash flow from operations and the proceeds of its public offerings will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on the company s operating results and does not expect inflation to have a material impact on the company s operating results in safe harbor statement the following safe harbor statement is made pursuant to the private securities litigation reform act of certain of the statements contained in the body of this report are forward looking statements rather than historical facts that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
with respect to such forward looking statements  the company seeks the protections afforded by the private securities litigation reform act of the list set forth below is intended to identify certain of the principal factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements included elsewhere herein 
these factors are not intended to represent a complete list of all risks and uncertainties inherent in the company s business  and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed cautionary statements included elsewhere herein 
competition 
the current market for cmms software is both fragmented and highly competitive  and management expects competition to intensify as new companies enter the market and existing ones expand their product lines 
the company has entered into new markets at the low end of the market and  more importantly  at the high end of the market through both its introduction of an internally developed client server product line and through the acquisition of sql systems 
management expects the company to face increased competition across all products lines in the company s future performance is partially dependent upon the company s ability to respond to technological changes  evolving standards and its competitors innovations 
certain competitors have greater financial  marketing  service and support and technical resources than datastream and sql 
effects of technological change and risks of product development 
the company s industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
datastream s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and develop new ones that address technological and market developments 
certain of the company s software research and development efforts are technologically challenging  and there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that the resulting products will achieve market acceptance 
dependence on a limited number of products 
approximately of the company s revenues were derived from sales of the windows versions of sidearm  mp  maintainit and mp for windows client server and related services and support 
accordingly  the company s financial performance will depend on continued market acceptance of these products and of the client server version of mp for windows 
any factor adversely affecting sales of the company s products  such as delays in development  significant software flaws  negative product evaluations or incompatibility with significant hardware platforms could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
risks associated with international sales 
international sales increased to of the company s revenues from in  and management expects that an increasing portion of the company s total revenues will be derived from international operations conducted in foreign currencies 
changes in the value of these currencies relative to the dollar could affect datastream s results of operations and financial position  and gains and losses on currency translations could contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company generally operates with very little backlog  and a significant portion of datastream s revenues in any quarter results from a large number of relatively small orders received during that period 
accordingly  the company is subject to fluctuations in the number of overall orders in any given period  which is in turn influenced by the overall level of economic and industrial activity 
datastream establishes expense levels based in part on its expectations as to future net sales 
if the company s revenues are below expectations  operating results may be materially adversely affected 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
impact of sql acquisition the acquisition of sql has impacted and will continue to impact the reporting  control and management capabilities of the company in while management believes it fully understands and can address the challenges encountered during the integration process  a number of aspects of sql s business cause management to recognize that it cannot provide assurance concerning the company s ability to maintain revenue or earnings growth in the future at the same levels that have been achieved historically 
these aspects include the global scope of sql operations  the fact this is the company s first major acquisition  the differences encountered in the high end markets in which sql competes  the seasonality of sql s revenues  and the fact that a disproportionate share of sql s sales occur at the end of each quarter and that the dollar amount of an sql transaction is substantially greater than the historical dollar amount of an average datastream transaction 
as noted above  this brief summary of certain of the principal factors that may potentially influence the company s results of operations and financial conditions is not intended to be exhaustive  and should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements made herein and in the company s publicly filed reports
