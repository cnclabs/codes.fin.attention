item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results and financial condition of the company for the three fiscal years ended june  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data included elsewhere herein 
certain statements contained herein are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated as a result of various factors  including cyclical and other industry downturns  the effects of federal and state legislation on health care reform  including medicare and medicaid financing  the inability to realize the full benefit of recent capital expenditures or consolidation and rationalization activities  difficulties or delays in the introduction of new products or disruptions in selling  manufacturing and or shipping efforts 
from december through november the company completed seven acquisitions which significantly expanded its product lines 
these acquisitions were each accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and were financed primarily through bank borrowings  resulting in a large increase in the company s debt and interest expense 
one acquisition was partially financed through the issuance of common stock 
results of operations of each acquired company have been included in allied s consolidated statement of operations from the date of acquisition 
the purchase price of each acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired was  in each instance  recorded as goodwill and is amortized over or year periods from the date of acquisition 
primarily as a result of these acquisitions  the company incurred a total of approximately million in goodwill amortization expense in the fiscal year ended june  the following table summarizes the seven acquisitions dollars in millions purchase date business products price december life support products  inc lsp emergency medical equipment march hospital systems  inc hsi headwall products september b f medical products  inc b f home health care respiratory therapy products february bear medical systems  inc bear critical care ventilators may bicore monitoring systems  inc bicore monitoring systems equipment for ventilators june design principles  inc dpi emergency medical equipment november omni tech medical  inc omni tech transport ventilators these acquisitions expanded the breadth of products the company offers and has strategically placed the company in the potential high growth markets of home health care and extended care 
the company believes that the expansion of product line offerings is particularly important in international markets as the company continues to increase its worldwide presence 
while the company continues to believe that these acquisitions will provide a source of future growth in sales and earnings  the integration and rationalization of the acquired businesses are still in progress 
the softness experienced in core domestic markets during fiscal and in the early part of fiscal combined with internal disruptions caused by a work stoppage in june and a computer conversion in october  both in the st 
louis facility  as well as ongoing negotiations with the company s commercial bank syndicate  put pressures on margins and adversely affected the company s results of operations in fiscal in addition  higher interest expense incurred under restructured credit facilities also adversely affected the company s results of operations 
progress made by the company on its consolidation activities and capital projects during fiscal is as follows respiratory products salesforce consolidation and training during fiscal  the company consolidated its patient care specialists with its ventilator specialists to create a person respiratory products specialists field sales force 
the training required for this consolidation was completed in november benefits expected from this consolidation include optimization of selling expenses through increased sales coverage  broadening product offerings for each sales call  significantly reducing the geographic territory for each sales specialist and leveraging the strengths of these complementary product lines while enabling the sales specialists to enhance their relationships with customers 
home health care sales during the third quarter of fiscal  the company completed the refocus of its sales efforts for the home health care product line to durable medical equipment dealers dme s 
allied increased its inside telemarketing sales group by six and reduced the field sales force by ten 
expanding the inside telemarketing sales efforts increases the penetration to the dme s and provides greater coverage and improved customer response time 
allied invested in updated catalogues  literature  and other mailings during the third quarter of fiscal to augment its increased telemarketing focus 
contracts with  and sales to  national home health care chains of these products continue to be made by the company s national account sales force 
information systems enhancements the company made advances in upgrading its information technology capabilities during fiscal in october  the company converted its corporate offices and its st 
louis manufacturing operations to a new fully integrated software system 
this computer conversion  which should provide strategic long term benefits to the company  caused short term disruptions in manufacturing scheduling and shipping of products which  management believes  resulted in some permanently lost sales 
the tools and capabilities of the new system have enabled the company to improve manufacturing planning and scheduling  enhance forecasting and inventory control  and enhance customer service by improving the quantity and quality of customer and product information 
the company also plans to convert its toledo  ohio operations to the new system  and preliminary implementation activities have begun 
when fully implemented  the information technology system enhancements should enable the company to realize potential synergies of acquisitions through an efficient integrated data base  enhanced management reporting systems and consolidation of certain operational functions 
capital expenditure projects the company made significant progress in modernizing two of its primary manufacturing facilities during fiscal through a capital lease  the company acquired five computer controlled machining centers for its st 
louis  missouri facility and completed the programming and installation process in the third quarter of fiscal this million investment modernized the company s metal machining capabilities and provides significant opportunities to reduce product costs from shorter set up times and elimination of secondary operations in component manufacturing  inventory levels  and scrap and to improve quality 
in addition  the company invested million in molds and injection molding machinery to expand the production capacity and gain efficiencies at its toledo  ohio facility 
manufacturing inefficiencies and capacity constraints caused by outdated injection molding machinery has prevented the company from shipping to the level of demand for certain products 
this investment in enhanced injection molding capabilities is expected to increase annual production  improve overall quality and provide significant cost reduction opportunities  arising from reduced product material content and lower labor and utility costs 
under this investment program  six injection molding machines and eleven molds have been installed as of june  while the company has expended both monetary and human resources on these projects in fiscal and intends to continue emphasizing these and other internally controlled projects  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing these projects and realizing the anticipated synergies 
fiscal fourth quarter results of operations the fiscal fourth quarter represented a difficult period for the company 
results of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal were adversely impacted by a variety of factors 
the nineteen day work stoppage at the company s st 
louis  missouri facility in june resulted in a permanent loss in sales  margin declines  and plant inefficiencies 
interest expense increased to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily due to fees paid to the company s commercial bank group to obtain waivers for technical covenant violations and for other matters related to its borrowing agreement 
finally  based on management s assessment of facts related to or culminating in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company increased certain reserves and recorded other charges to operations during the fourth quarter which totaled approximately million 
included in these charges were certain adjustments to the carrying value of certain of the company s inventories of million  an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts of million  million for the settlement of a lawsuit related to a pre acquisition matter at one of the company s acquired subsidiaries  and million for a new product licensing agreement 
as a result of these and various other factors described below  fourth quarter fiscal net sales were million while the net loss was million compared to fourth quarter net sales of million and a net loss of million in the prior year 
sales of respiratory therapy equipment for the fourth quarter were million  an increase of million  or  compared to sales of million in the prior year 
sales to the hospital market were up in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal this increase was primarily due to the strong worldwide market acceptance of recent technology improvements in both the adult critical care ventilator and allied s new infant ventilator 
sales to the home health care market  however  were down by in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal this decrease in sales was attributable to pricing pressures in the home health care market  capacity problems in the toledo facility and  to a lesser extent  the impact of the st 
louis work stoppage 
sales of medical gas equipment for the fourth quarter were million  a decline of million  or  compared to sales of million in the prior year 
the work stoppage in st 
louis adversely impacted sales of medical gas regulation devices and medical gas inwall construction products 
emergency medical products sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million were million  or  under sales of million in the comparable prior period 
this sales trend is a continuation of the first nine months of fiscal as a decline in new orders and production constraints described in the following section have impacted sales of emergency medical products 
gross profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit and gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal were adversely impacted by the effects of the june work stoppage at the st 
louis  missouri facility and the adjustments to the carrying value of the company s inventories described above 
gross profit and gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal were adversely impacted by a decline in manufacturing volumes in certain product lines  which resulted in the expensing of a portion of fixed plant overhead costs as period costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a decrease of million compared to sg a expenses of million in the comparable prior year period 
the fiscal fourth quarter included the previously noted increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts  lawsuit settlement charge and new product license fee which aggregated approximately million 
in addition  the company completed severance payments related to the field salesforce consolidation and made investments in promotional material for the home health care market during the fourth quarter of fiscal the loss from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million compared to a loss of million in the prior year reflecting the factors described above 
interest expense for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  an increase of million over interest expense of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal sequentially  interest expense increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal to million compared to fiscal third quarter interest expense of million 
this increase was directly attributable to the fees paid to the commercial bank group to obtain waivers for technical covenant violations at march   fees paid for not obtaining a commitment to reduce the bank group s indebtedness by million by may   fees paid for professional services related to credit negotiations and related audits  and the amortization of prepaid loan costs 
on august  the company refinanced its existing bank debt through a new million credit facility with foothill capital corporation  a division of norwest bank  and also obtained million of financing through a private placement debt arrangement 
the new financing agreements are discussed further below 
the company incurred a loss before income taxes of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to a net loss of million in the same period for the prior year 
the company recorded a tax benefit of million in both the fourth quarter of fiscal and fiscal for an effective tax rate of and in fiscal and fiscal respectively 
the fiscal fourth quarter tax rate was impacted by the continued loss from operations  the non deductibility of certain goodwill amortization  and the expected lack of availability of the company s foreign sales tax credit 
results of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal were a net loss of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in the fourth quarter of fiscal results of operations allied manufactures and markets respiratory products  including respiratory therapy equipment  medical gas equipment and emergency medical products

provision benefit for income taxes net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal of million were million  or  less than net sales of million in fiscal certain internal and external factors impacted the company s sales during fiscal included in the internal operating issues which impacted the company were the nineteen day work stoppage in the st 
louis  missouri facility in june  disruptions to manufacturing  scheduling and shipping created by the computer conversion in october  also in the st 
louis facility  capacity constraints at the toledo  ohio facility and changes in the field salesforce 
the work stoppage resulted in permanently lost sales  margin declines  and manufacturing disruptions during the work stoppage as well as during the pre and post work stoppage periods 
in october  the company converted its st 
louis manufacturing and corporate office operations to a new  fully integrated software system 
the computer conversion  which should provide a strategic long term benefit to the company  caused short term disruptions in manufacturing and shipping  resulting in lost sales 
management believes that any remaining issues regarding the computer conversion were substantially resolved by the end of the third quarter of fiscal through additional training and program enhancements 
the toledo facility has been capacity constrained by outdated injection molding machinery and molds 
during fiscal the company installed six new injection mold machines and eleven molds  and the company is now adding to its direct labor assembly force in toledo 
finally  as previously described  the company consolidated its respiratory field salesforce and refocused its sales effort for the home health care product line to inside telemarketing 
each of these initiatives created short term sales disruptions in addition to the company s incurrence of recruiting  training and marketing costs in fiscal certain external issues first experienced in fiscal continued to impact the company s fiscal operations 
the emphasis of healthcare providers on cost containment has resulted in significant consolidation in the healthcare environment in recent years 
such consolidation impacted sales as customers appeared to defer capital purchases as they rationalized their operations and delayed non capital purchases as they reduced their consolidated inventory levels 
in addition  the consolidation of healthcare providers increased the buying power of these customers  which resulted in pricing pressures 
finally  the uncertainty over the federal budget  particularly the possibility of changes in medicaid and medicare reimbursement rates  has impacted sales 
congress has deferred resolution on various health care policy issues  and the company is unable to predict the ramifications of this deferral on future sales 
while the company is unable to predict when these macroeconomic issues will be resolved  management believes that  over a long term horizon  allied is well positioned to capitalize on the need for its respiratory products and meet the demands of these products caused by an aging population  an increase in the occurrence of lung disease  and advances in treatment of other respiratory illnesses in the home  hospital  and sub acute care facilities 
new orders  or the pace of incoming business  was strong throughout fiscal fiscal orders of million were million  or  over orders of million in fiscal while fiscal orders were impacted by the work stoppage  computer conversion  and salesforce consolidation activities  as previously discussed  fiscal orders exceeded same period fiscal orders in all four quarters 
the increase in orders appears to have been driven by an increase in market demand for the company s core products in medical gas construction and medical gas equipment as well as the strong worldwide acceptance of the company s new ventilation technologies in adult and infant ventilators 
medical gas equipment sales of million in fiscal were million  or  under prior year sales of million 
medical gas equipment sales in fiscal were adversely impacted by the previously noted june work stoppage and the effects of the computer conversion 
however  market demand for medical gas equipment sales has been strong  as reflected in new orders for fiscal of million  which was million  or  over new orders in the prior fiscal year 
it appears that the consolidation of health care providers may be slowing  and the related rationalization process for facility protocol and inventory consolidation may be nearing completion 
however  management is unable to predict when the full ramifications of such consolidation will be felt 
respiratory therapy equipment sales in fiscal of million were unchanged from the prior year 
sales to the hospital market increased as sales of ventilation products increased due to the strong world wide acceptance of the smart trigger technology for the company s adult critical care ventilator and technology advances incorporated in the new infant ventilator  the bear cub r 
in addition  the company expects to achieve further benefits in the future from the previously noted combination of its ventilation and patient care sales forces  which was substantially completed in november offsetting the increase in ventilation product sales was an decline in sales of home health care products 
this decline primarily resulted from manufacturing constraints in the company s toledo  ohio facility  combined with pricing pressures caused by the ongoing consolidation of home health care dealers 
concerns over potential reductions in home oxygen therapy reimbursement rates also continued to impact sales of home health care products in fiscal while the company is unable to predict when these latter two macroeconomic factors will be resolved  it believes that until there is a resolution of reimbursement policy issues  current customer purchase patterns are likely to continue 
the previously described installation of new equipment and molds at the toledo  ohio facility have been in accordance with management s expectations  however  the company s capacity issues have not fully been resolved due to direct labor constraints 
management is currently addressing this constraint through the addition of a third shift 
to enhance home health care product sales  the company has shifted its sales emphasis to inside telemarketing sales to increase sales coverage and penetration to dme s  as previously discussed 
emergency medical products sales in fiscal of million were million  or  under sales of million in the prior year 
this sales decline was attributable to difficulties the company had in the relocation of production of emergency products to the st 
louis  missouri facility  the impact of the june work stoppage and the absence of a large stocking order that occurred in the prior year 
the emergency medical products business has two elements 
one is steady replacement sales and the other element is driven by events  such as a natural disaster or change in emergency protocol in a particular country 
management expects sales for the near future to primarily reflect demand driven by the replacement segment of the business 
the company continued to increase its presence in world wide markets during fiscal international sales  which are included in the product line sales discussed above  increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to sales of million in fiscal advances in medical protocol in various countries throughout the world combined with the company s strong international dealer network has enabled the company to respond to the increased worldwide demand for respiratory products 
in addition  the strong worldwide market acceptance of the smart trigger r technology for the company s adult critical care ventilator combined with the recent introduction of the new bear cub r infant ventilator has fueled the growth of international sales 
gross profit in fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to gross profit of million  or of net sales in fiscal the impact of the nineteen day work stoppage and the computer conversion in the st 
louis  missouri facility during fiscal reduced manufacturing output and margins 
in addition  the increase in international sales  which have lower margins than domestic sales due to the large quantity  bid based nature of these sales  combined with pricing pressures brought on by consolidations which occurred in the company s customer base  particularly in the hospital and home health care markets  resulted in reduced margins 
in fiscal  as previously described  the company recorded certain adjustments to the carrying value of its inventories in the fourth quarter of approximately million 
in fiscal  the company charged a portion of fixed plant costs as period costs due to a decline in manufacturing throughput 
this fiscal charge primarily related to the fourth quarter 
the company anticipates continued pressures on margins due to the mix of domestic vs 
international sales and anticipates continued pricing pressures from its customer base 
in response to margin pressures  the company made significant investments in capital expenditures in its st 
louis  missouri and toledo  ohio facilities which are designed to reduce manufacturing costs  improve manufacturing cycle times  improve quality and reduce inventory levels 
the company continues to evaluate its business with an intent to streamline operations  improve productivity and reduce costs 
accordingly  the company may implement additional sales force  manufacturing and other strategic rationalization programs in the future 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal were million  an increase of million over sg a expenses of million in fiscal the company made strategic investments in certain sg a activities and recorded certain non recurring sg a expenses in fiscal sg a spending included investments in advertising and marketing literature  investments in information technology  and continued investments in research and development  all expenditures that potentially could benefit future periods 
in addition  as previously described  the company completed the recruiting  training and consolidation of its respiratory products salesforce and incurred duplicate costs for sales efforts to the dme s in the home health care market during the transition period of shifting to telemarketing from field sales representatives 
while recruiting and training efforts of the field salesforce will continue  these expenditures are expected to be less than the relatively high level of expenditures during fiscal fiscal sg a expenses also included the previously noted increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts  lawsuit settlement charge and new product license fee which aggregated approximately million 
finally  the fiscal sg a expenses were affected by a research grant of million which did not repeat in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  fiscal sg a expenses were compared to in fiscal this increase was attributable to higher sg a expenses in fiscal  as discussed above  combined with lower sales during the year 
income from operations in fiscal of million was million  or  below fiscal income from operations of million 
as a percentage of net sales  income from operations decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal these decreases were attributable to the factors discussed above 
interest expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal consisted of approximately million of fees and other professional costs incurred in connection with the debt amendments  as previously described  million related to increased amortization of prepaid loan costs  million related to increased interest costs for the capital expenditure projects previously discussed  and million  reflecting increases in effective interest rates which were partially offset by lower average debt levels 
during fiscal the company spent significant time and resources on various matters relating to its debt agreement with a commercial bank group  including negotiating a debt amendment on september  and obtaining waivers for technical covenant violations as of december  and march  the company was ultimately unable to negotiate a long term financing arrangement with its commercial bank syndicate 
on august   subsequent to fiscal year end  the company entered into a million credit facility with foothill capital corporation and obtained million in subordinated debt in a private placement arrangement 
the new financing arrangement  which is expected to lower the company s interest expense and provide additional liquidity  is discussed further below 
the company had a loss before income taxes of million  a decrease of million from the income before provision for taxes of million in fiscal the company recorded a tax benefit of million in fiscal for an effective tax rate of  compared to a provision for income taxes of million in fiscal and an effective tax rate of 
the fiscal effective tax rate was impacted by the loss from operations  the non deductibility of certain goodwill amortization  and the expected lack of availability of the company s foreign sales tax credit in fiscal net loss in fiscal was million  or per share  a decrease of million from net income of million or earnings per share of in fiscal the weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in calculation of per share loss or earnings was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in the weighted average number of common shares reflected the effects of the october sale of  shares of common stock in a public offering 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales included million in sales as a result of acquisitions partially offset by a decline of million in sales of existing products 
numerous external and internal factors adversely impacted the company s sales during fiscal certain macro economic factors first experienced in the second quarter continued to impact sales throughout the remainder of fiscal  most notably in the fourth quarter 
political uncertainty over the federal budget  particularly the possibility of changes in medicare and medicaid financing and health care provider reimbursement rates  adversely impacted customer purchasing decisions 
in late april  congress resolved the federal fiscal budget issue  but deferred resolution of health care policy issues 
the on going consolidation of health care providers also impacted sales as this activity appears to have caused customers to delay capital purchases as they rationalized their operations  and to delay non capital purchases as they reduced their consolidated inventory levels 
the market softness experienced as a result of external factors heightened the impact of internal factors on fiscal sales  most notably in the fourth quarter 
internally  the company experienced disruption in its ventilation product line field sales force due to the effects of high turnover rates 
due to the technical nature of selling the ventilation product line  significant efforts and resources were expended to recruit and train the current field sales force 
in addition  transitioning from distributor sales to a direct field sales force in certain other product lines  as well as manufacturing capacity issues  also adversely impacted fiscal sales 
the company experienced margin pressures in a number of its product lines due to several factors 
these factors included the significant consolidation of home health care dealers and the resultant pricing pressures from these customers  the adverse impact of reduced volume on the cost of manufacturing due to the fixed nature of a significant portion of the company s production costs  the impact of manufacturing inefficiencies experienced at one of the company s plants  and the higher mix of lower margin international sales 
respiratory therapy equipment sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal  compared to sales of million for fiscal the increase in sales of respiratory therapy products included million related to acquisitions  partially offset by a decline of million in sales of existing products 
the impact of political uncertainty over the federal budget reconciliation legislation and a pledge by the healthcare financing administration  the federal agency that administers medicare  to significantly reduce the medicare home oxygen rental fee rates contributed to the decline in sales of existing products 
market softness for capital expenditure products such as critical care ventilators  the consolidation of home health care dealers  and increased competitive pressure to obtain business from national accounts put pressure on pricing and margins throughout the last three quarters of in addition  manufacturing inefficiencies and capacity constraints experienced at one of the company s facilities during fiscal prevented the company from shipping to the level of demand for certain products 
medical gas equipment sales of million for fiscal decreased million  or  compared to sales of million during fiscal consolidation of health care providers in the acute and post acute care markets combined with customer concerns over the outcome of possible capital reimbursement policy changes adversely impacted fiscal sales 
while the consolidation of health care providers appears to be slowing  management expects that sales of medical gas equipment should continue to be adversely impacted until capital reimbursement policy issues are resolved 
emergency medical products sales of million for fiscal increased million  or  compared to sales of million during fiscal the increase in sales included million related to acquisitions partially offset by a decline of million in existing products 
the company believes the decline in existing emergency medical products sales was attributable to the timing of orders and shipments 
the acquisition of omni tech in november had a favorable impact on sales to the us government  with million in incremental sales during fiscal the company continued to increase its presence in worldwide markets during fiscal international sales  which are included in the product line sales discussed above  increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal acquisitions contributed million of the fiscal increase in international sales which was partially offset by a decline in sales by million of existing products 
the decline in international sales of existing products primarily resulted from fewer new hospital construction projects in mexico and other latin american markets 
gross profit of million in fiscal decreased million  or  from million in fiscal as a result of sales mix  customer pricing pressures and manufacturing volume issues 
the change in gross profit resulting from sales mix issues was due to the continued shift in sales to the home health care market which has lower margins than the construction product line  which had previously been the company s primary product group  the continued increase in international sales  which have lower margins than domestic sales due to the large quantity  bid based nature of these sales  and due to an increase in sales of distributed versus manufactured products during fiscal the consolidation of the company s customer base  particularly in the hospital and home health care markets  resulted in larger buying groups and national accounts which increased customers ability to negotiate prices 
accordingly  these pricing pressures had an adverse impact on gross profit margins 
in addition  the decline in existing product sales resulted in a decline in manufacturing volume in the company s plants  particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  a portion of fixed plant overhead costs was expensed as period costs  which adversely impacted margins 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sg a expenses for fiscal increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sg a expenses increased million as a result of acquisitions  most notably increased selling expenses for the demonstration based  direct sales intensive critical care ventilation product line  increased research and development costs for the critical care ventilation products  which include development of the new smart trigger and bear cub infant ventilator  and increased amortization expense attributable to the recent acquisitions 
as described previously  base period sg a expenses increased million as the company invested in additional training activities for the field sales force  technology upgrades in its information systems  and other strategic research and development projects 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase was attributable to the combined factors of a decline in sales of existing products and the strategic investments in training  technology and new products 
income from operations in fiscal of million was million  or  below fiscal income from operations of million 
as a percentage of net sales  income from operations decreased to from in fiscal this decrease was attributable to reduced sales of existing products  reduced gross margins  and the increase in sg a expenses discussed above 
other expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal interest expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal interest expense increased million due to increased debt required to finance recent acquisitions  offset almost entirely by a reduction in interest charges resulting from the reduction of existing bank debt as a consequence of the equity offering completed in october the additional debt required to finance working capital  capital expenditures and other operations accounted for the million net increase in interest expense in fiscal the effective interest rate was and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
income before provision for income taxes decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
the company s fiscal effective tax rate was compared to in fiscal this increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the amortization of non tax deductible acquisition goodwill  which has an increasing impact on the effective tax rate as pre tax income decreases 
net income in fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in fiscal earnings per share decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  or 
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in the calculation of earnings per share was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in the weighted average number of common shares was the result of the october sale of  shares of common stock and the september issuance of  shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of b f 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth selected information concerning allied s financial condition dollars in thousands june  cash  working capital    total debt    current ratio the company s working capital was million at june  compared to million at june   a decrease of million 
accounts receivables  inventories  and current assets all decreased during fiscal  while accounts payable  other liabilities and the current portion of long term debt all increased during fiscal accounts receivable decreased to million at june  from million at june  the million decrease in accounts receivable was due to the decline in days sales outstanding dso by three days to dso at june   combined with the decline in sales late in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting from the work stoppage in st 
louis 
inventories were million at june   a decrease of million from million at june  during fiscal  the company focused on reducing manufacturing cycle times through modernization of its plants and improvements in its manufacturing processes in order to better manage investments in inventories 
inventories  as measured in days on hand doh  declined by twelve days during fiscal to doh at june  compared to doh in the prior year 
in addition  the company made modest improvements in the mix of its inventories by increasing the safety stock levels of high volume products  for which customers require shortened delivery times  and reducing the stocking status of lower volume products 
the company plans to continue these inventory related initiatives in fiscal accounts payable of million and other accrued liabilities of million as of june  increased million and million  respectively  during fiscal the company experienced limited liquidity during fiscal due to a reduction in borrowing availability related to the principal payments made on its term loans combined with the high level of fees paid to the company s commercial bank group  as previously discussed 
consequently  payments to vendors and other obligations were extended  causing some disruption in deliveries and services 
the company s limited liquidity situation was alleviated with the completion of its new credit arrangement in august which is discussed further below 
the current portion of long term debt was million at june  compared to million in the prior year 
this increase reflects the terms of the new credit facility with foothill capital corporation which includes a million term loan and the placement of million in subordinated debt  both of which mature in february the new financing arrangements are discussed further below 
net cash increase decrease was million  million  and million in fiscal   and respectively 
net cash provided from used by operations was million  million  and million for the same periods 
cash flow from operations in fiscal consisted of a net loss of million offset by the non cash charges to operations of million for depreciation and amortization  as well as million in cash generated from changes in working capital accounts other than the current portion of long term debt 
the cash provided by operations was offset by a net reduction in debt of million  debt issuance costs of million  and dividend payments of million  resulting in a net decrease in cash of million in fiscal the adverse effect on results of operations has impacted the company s liquidity and the ability of the company to continue historical levels of fixed payments 
accordingly  on august  the company s board of directors voted to suspend quarterly dividends effective immediately subsequent to the payment of dividends for the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  on august   subsequent to fiscal year end  the company refinanced its existing credit facilities to reset its fixed debt payments and to provide the company with additional liquidity 
the refinancing is further discussed below 
besides cash flows from operations  the company is considering various alternatives to meet its debt service requirements in fiscal such debt service requirements include an aggregate of million in debt which matures in february   as described further below 
these alternatives include replacement of such maturing debt with long term financing  if available  and an asset sale 
at june   the company had aggregate indebtedness of million  including million of short term debt and million of long term debt 
aggregate indebtedness at june  was million  including million of short term debt and million of long term debt 
on october   the company entered into credit facilities with a commercial bank syndicate with a final maturity in the secured credit facilities included a million revolving credit facility and term loans of million and million  or aggregate credit facilities of million 
in september  the company s credit facilities were amended such that the million unused portion of the million acquisition term loan facility was no longer available 
additionally  amendments were made to the company s credit facilities to reset certain covenants  to temporarily increase advance rates on the revolving credit facility borrowing base and to enter into an additional million term loan  leaving credit facilities totalling million 
all credit facilities maturity dates were reset to july  during fiscal  the company paid fees of approximately million for the september debt amendment  to obtain waivers for technical covenant violations at december  and march  and for related matters 
the company was ultimately unable to negotiate a long term agreement with its commercial bank syndicate 
accordingly  on august   subsequent to fiscal year end  the company refinanced its existing debt through a new million credit facility with foothill capital corporation  a division of norwest bank 
the new credit facility  with a blended average interest rate of  is comprised of a million three year revolving line of credit  three year term loans of million and million  respectively  and a million loan maturing in february in conjunction with the new financing agreement  allied placed an additional million in subordinated debt financing  which matures in february  with several related parties to the company 
in addition  the company issued  warrants at an exercise price of per share   of which are being issued to the holders of the subordinated debt and the balance to foothill capital corporation 
the proceeds from the new financing were used to repay the company s outstanding debt with the commercial bank syndicate  and to provide additional liquidity 
at august   approximately million was available under the revolving line of credit for additional borrowings 
the new credit facility is expected to reduce the company s interest expense in future periods and provide additional liquidity  and reflects technical covenants which are consistent with the company s current financial projections 
capital expenditures  net of capital leases  were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
assets acquired under capital leases in fiscal totaled million and will modernize the company s st 
louis and toledo operations  as previously discussed 
fiscal capital expenditures included strategic investments in a new machining center for the company s st 
louis  missouri facility  the purchase of machinery and molds to increase capacity at its toledo  ohio facility and other normal recurring replacements of machinery and equipment

seasonality and quarterly results in past fiscal years  the company has experienced seasonal increases in net sales during its second and third fiscal quarters october through march which  in turn  affected net income 
such seasonal variations were likely attributable to an increase in hospital equipment purchases at the beginning of each calendar year which coincides with many hospitals fiscal years and an increase in the severity of influenza during winter months 
as the company has expanded its sales into the home health care  emergency medical and international markets  these seasonal variations have diminished  but have not disappeared 
the following table sets forth selected operating results for the eight quarters ended june  the information for each of these quarters is unaudited  but includes all normal recurring adjustments which the company considers necessary for a fair presentation thereof

further  operating results may fluctuate as a result of the timing of orders  the company s product and customer mix  the introduction of new products by the company and its competitors  and overall trends in the health care industry and the economy 
while these patterns have an impact on the company s quarterly operations  the company is unable to predict the extent of this impact in any particular period
