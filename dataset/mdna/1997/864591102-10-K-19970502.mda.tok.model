the company has a wide range of customers  including corporate buyers executives  sales managers  human resource managers  and production managers of larger corporations  entrepreneurial buyers small business owners  home office businesses  and sales professionals  as well as individual consumers  schools and athletic organizations 
the company s products are marketed primarily under its successories and winners collection trade names through direct marketing both catalog and telemarketing  retail sales both franchise and company owned stores  and wholesale distribution 
although the company utilizes multiple distribution channels for its products  the company s products have similar purposes and uses in each channel of distribution and similar opportunities for growth 
the profitability varies among products and distribution channels 
the company utilizes its facilities interchangeably for each distribution channel 
furthermore  the marketing channels are directed at a single customer base located primarily in the united states 
for the twelve months ended february   the nine months ended february   and the twelve months ended april   retail sales  direct mail sales and wholesale distribution sales accounted for the following percentages of the company s net product sales for the months for the months for the months for the months ended ended ended ended february  february  february  april  retail direct mail wholesale distribution includes sales to franchisees 
the gross profit margins for retail sales attributable to company owned stores is slightly lower than direct marketing sales due to more non proprietary products being sold in retail 
the gross profit margin for wholesale sales and sales to franchisees is lower  since these sales are made primarily at a significant discount from retail price 
during the fiscal year ended april   the company repurchased franchise development territories from a number of franchisees 
at the inception of the company s franchise program  the successories retail store concept was in the initial stages and the company had not fully developed its plans for the expansion of its retail system 
the company initially sold franchise development territories to individual franchisees  granting each franchisee the right to develop multiple retail locations in a cluster within the defined territory 
as this program progressed  however  the existing franchisees were either unwilling or unable to develop an acceptable number of retail locations within their respective territories in the time frame required to take maximum advantage of the opportunity 
as a result  the company initiated a program to repurchase the existing franchise development territories that were perceived as being underdeveloped  and implemented an ongoing strategy to offer franchises predominantly in areas that would not support the development of multiple retail locations 
during fiscal  the company completed the repurchase of those major metropolitan areas that were perceived as being underdeveloped  including atlanta  georgia  los angeles  california  and denver  colorado 
the company s franchise agreements do not require the company to purchase the franchise and the company does not expect a continuing pattern of such repurchases in the future 
the company believes that the areas subject to franchise development territory agreements that remain in effect are being adequately developed so as not to require any immediate additional repurchase efforts
