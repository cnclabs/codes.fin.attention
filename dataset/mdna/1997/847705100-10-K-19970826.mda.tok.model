item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company designs  develops  manufactures  markets and services chemical mechanical planarization  or cmp  systems used in the fabrication of semiconductor devices and other high throughput precision surface processing systems used in the fabrication of thin film memory disk media  semiconductor wafers and general industrial components 
in addition  the company markets and distributes parts and expendables and slurries 
the company s total revenue consists of net sales in two business segments i equipment  parts and expendables  and ii slurries  as well as commissions earned on the distribution in the us and europe of products manufactured by the far east joint venture 
sales of the company s products are recorded upon shipment or when the product is accepted by the customer  provided that no significant obligations remain outstanding and collection of the related receivable is deemed probable 
the company accrues estimated warranty and installation expenses for each equipment and system order at the time the order is shipped 
equipment  parts and expendables consist of capital equipment manufactured by the company  spare parts for that equipment and expendable products  such as bearings  grinding stones  lapping plates  workpiece carriers  seals  retaining rings  workholders and polishing pads 
during fiscal years   and    and respectively  of the company s net sales was attributable to the sale of capital equipment  parts and expendables 
historically  the gross margin for products in this segment has been significantly higher than that for slurries 
the company began development of its original cmp product  the cmp v  in the company initiated volume shipments of the cmp v in shipments of the auriga began in the second quarter of fiscal through may   the company had shipped auriga systems 
the company s cmp systems accounted for   and of net sales for fiscal   and respectively 
the company s cmp systems generally have gross margins higher than those of the company s other capital equipment products 
slurries consist of polishing slurry and slurry components including vehicles and abrasives used in surface processing 
during fiscal years   and    and  respectively  of the company s net sales was attributable to the sale of slurries 
substantially all of the slurries sold by the company are manufactured by fujimi incorporated 
historically  the gross margin for slurries has been significantly lower than that for equipment  parts and expendables 
in recent years  the company has experienced severe competitive pressure in the sale of slurries and has been required to reduce prices 
in addition  the company has experienced increased slurry costs 
commissions from affiliate commissions consist primarily of revenue derived from the distribution by the company in the us and europe of products manufactured by the far east joint venture for which the company acts as sales agent 
certain capital equipment marketed and distributed by the company is produced solely by the far east joint venture 
the company distributes such products throughout the us and europe and receives commissions thereon 
such amount reflects the difference between the imported equipment s cost to the company and sales price to the customer 
for fiscal   and  commissions accounted for    respectively  of total revenue 
commissions are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which can significantly impact operating profit margins 
in fiscal   and    and  respectively  of the company s total revenue was attributable to sales outside of the united states 
in particular  in fiscal  of the company s total revenue was attributable to sales made to european markets and was attributable to sales to markets in the far east 
the company generally enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies  principally in japanese yen 
the terms of the contracts are rarely more than one year 
currency exchange rate variations have had an immaterial effect on the company s results of operations for the periods presented 
the results of operations of the company s subsidiaries and its equity in the net earnings of the far east joint venture are translated for financial statement purposes based upon average exchange rates during the period covered 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse effect of the company s results of operations 
net assets of the company s foreign subsidiaries and of the net assets of the far east joint venture were approximately million at april  the end of fiscal of such entities 
the company owns a interest in both the far east joint venture and the fujimi joint venture 
the company s equity interest in each joint venture is accounted for on the equity method 
as a result  the company s share of the net earnings of the far east joint venture and the fujimi joint venture appear in the equity in net earnings of affiliates caption on the company s consolidated statements of earnings 
the far east joint venture and the fujimi joint venture have paid dividends in the past and may continue to do so in the foreseeable future  but are expected to reinvest substantially all their earnings back into their respective businesses 
the company s share of the net earnings of the far east joint venture has not in the past resulted and is not expected in the future to result in a like effect on the cash flows of the company 
at may   the company s equity interest in the far east joint venture was million  representing of the company s total assets and of shareholders equity 
the net earnings of the company in the past have been substantially influenced by the results of operations of the far east joint venture and can be expected to continue to be so influenced in the future

included elsewhere herein 
historically  a disproportionate share of the company s revenue and operating profit has been attributable to the last two quarters of the company s fiscal year  primarily the fourth quarter 
in particular  the company typically experiences a decline in revenues and operating profit from the fourth fiscal quarter to the first fiscal quarter of the succeeding year 
the company believes that this decline is primarily due to the seasonal buying patterns of its customers 
sales of slurries tend to be more consistent than equipment sales on a quarterly basis 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of earnings data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue years ended may  revenue net sales commissions from affiliate total revenue cost of sales gross margin operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative expenses operating profit other income expense earnings from consolidated companies before income taxes income tax expense earnings from consolidated companies equity in net earnings of affiliates net earnings fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended may  were million  up over net sales of million in fiscal equipment  parts and expendables accounted for of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the growth in this segment was attributable to higher sales of the company s cmp planarization systems to the semiconductor industry 
sales of cmp systems totaled million  or of net sales  more than double the million of cmp system sales in fiscal in addition to the significant increase in cmp equipment sales to semiconductor manufacturers  net sales for the fiscal year increased due to a higher level of sales of equipment  parts and expendables to the thin film memory disk media market 
sales of slurries increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal however  as a percent of net sales  sales of slurries decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal european sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal commissions from affiliate 
commissions from affiliate increased to million in the year ended may   compared to million in the year ended may  the increase in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to increased demand in the silicon wafer industry for polishing systems developed and manufactured by the far east joint venture 
in addition  sales of cleaning and polishing systems  also produced by the far east joint venture  to customers in the thin film memory disk media market increased significantly in fiscal over fiscal commissions from affiliate also improved over the prior year due to improved margins on import machines 
gross margin 
in fiscal  gross margin was million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  in fiscal in addition to higher sales levels  gross margin has increased due to a continuing increase in sales of higher margin equipment  particularly systems for the planarization of semiconductor devices 
in addition  higher commission revenue contributed to the increased gross margins in fiscal research  development and engineering 
in the year ended may   research  development and engineering expense increased to million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  in fiscal the increase in both the dollar amount and as a percent of total revenue is a result of the continued investment in the development of the cmp process and products for key markets  particularly for the semiconductor sector  and the increase in the company s field support organization throughout the world 
such expenditures have resulted in the development and sale of the auriga machine  the next generation of the cmp v system  and the development of the capella post cmp cleaning system 
selling  general and administrative 
in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expense increased to million from million in fiscal in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expense increased as a percent of total revenue to from in fiscal higher levels of spending were required to support the sales growth in fiscal this increase in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue reflects continued investments in the sales and administrative infrastructure  as well as increased commissions paid to the far east joint venture as a result of increased sales of cmp systems produced by the company in the us and exported to pacific rim customers though its joint venture affiliate 
other income expense 
other expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal other income expense includes charges associated with the company s public common stock offering in the first quarter of fiscal which was subsequently canceled  interest expense  miscellaneous expenses and interest income 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared to in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate in fiscal differs from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of state taxes  net of the us federal benefit offset by the tax benefit from a foreign sales corporation and research and development tax credits 
equity in net earnings of affiliates 
for the year ended may   equity in net earnings of affiliates increased to million compared to million in the year ended may  demand continued to be strong for products sold to the thin film memory and semiconductor wafer industries by the far east joint venture 
however  the company does not expect that this historical rate of earnings growth will continue 
as a result  the company does not expect earnings for the far east joint venture to grow in the next fiscal year 
in addition  the company s share of the net earnings of the fujimi joint venture was significantly higher than in fiscal due to increased sales and improved margins realized during fiscal on slurry products sold by the fujimi joint venture to the us silicon wafer market 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended may  were million  almost double the net sales of million reported in fiscal equipment  parts and expendables accounted for of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal cmp v sales were million and accounted for of net sales in fiscal  up from in fiscal in addition to the significant increase in cmp v sales to semiconductor manufacturers  net sales increased due to industry growth in the thin film memory disk media and semiconductor wafer markets 
as a result  sales of related equipment  parts and expendables also increased in fiscal over fiscal sales of slurries as a percent of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal commissions from affiliate 
commissions from affiliate more than doubled to million in the year ended may   compared to million in the year ended may  the increase in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to the increasing demand from the silicon wafer industry to meet that industry s growing capacity requirements  and increased demand for certain technologies developed and manufactured by the far east joint venture 
gross margin 
in fiscal  gross margin was million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  in fiscal in addition to higher sales levels  gross margin increased due to a considerable shift towards higher margin products in the equipment  parts and expendables segment  particularly the cmp v planarization system 
research  development and engineering 
in the year ended may   research  development and engineering expense increased to million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  in fiscal the company has committed significant resources to the continued development of the cmp process and other related technologies 
the company believes that increased spending in research  development and engineering  including providing required technical support services for needs of customers  are all major factors to continued cmp sales growth 
selling  general and administrative 
in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expense increased to million from million in fiscal in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expense decreased as a percent of total revenue compared to fiscal due to the significantly higher level of sales between the same periods 
however  higher levels of spending were required to support this sales growth including additional administrative and sales personnel  new service and sales locations  and distributor commissions to the far east joint venture on export sales from the us to the far east region 
other income expense 
other expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in fiscal  the company incurred a  foreign exchange loss on several import equipment orders 
in addition  interest expense decreased from fiscal to fiscal due to the retirement of the outstanding balance of a revolving line of credit and the retirement of long term debt payable to a former director 
the remaining decrease in other expense is due primarily to additional interest income earned on the investment of proceeds received upon completion of the company s initial public offering of common stock in october provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared to in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate in fiscal differs from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of state taxes  net of the us federal benefit

equity in net earnings of affiliates 
for the year ended may   equity in net earnings of affiliates increased to million compared to million in the year ended may  the increase is primarily attributable to a continued strong demand for products sold to the thin film memory and semiconductor wafer industries by the far east joint venture 
in addition  profits of the far east joint venture have increased due to improvements in manufacturing  cost reduction programs and a lower effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended  may   million in cash was provided by operating activities primarily from net earnings 
cash from operating activities was also provided by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expense liabilities since the beginning of the fiscal year 
cash was used in operating activities primarily to reduce the due to affiliates liability  income taxes payable and to support growth in accounts receivable and inventories 
the company recently completed construction of its new corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility in chandler  arizona 
total costs incurred for the project were approximately million 
on february   the company completed a public offering of common stock 
in connection therewith  the company issued  shares of common stock and received proceeds of million  net of underwriters discounts and commissions and offerings expenses

this discussion is not exclusive of other factors that may also affect the company s business and should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this form k including  without limitation  information provided in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on cmp systems the company believes that its future growth  if any  depends in large part upon its ability to grow revenues attributable to its cmp systems and its technology 
revenue growth attributable to the company s cmp system depends upon numerous factors  including cost of ownership  throughput  process flexibility  performance and reliability and availability of customer support 
the company intends to periodically develop and introduce enhanced versions of its cmp system 
failure to continually enhance the company s cmp system may impact its ability to grow revenues attributable to its cmp systems 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in growing revenue attributable to its current cmp systems  or any future enhanced version of the system 
the failure of the company to accomplish these objectives would have a material adverse effect on the company 
see dependence on new product development  rapid technological change 
dependence on new product development  rapid technological change the company believes that its future success will depend  in part  on its ability to enhance existing products and processes and develop and manufacture new products and processes 
the markets in which the company and its customers compete are characterized by evolving industry standards and frequent improvements in products and services 
to compete effectively in such markets  the company must continually improve its products and its process technologies and develop new technologies and products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance 
the company expects to continue to make significant investments in research  development and engineering 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to improve its existing products and its process technologies or develop new products and technologies 
the company intends to continually develop and or introduce enhanced versions of its cmp system and post cmp cleaning system 
there can be no assurance that the company s development of new or enhanced products  such as enhanced versions of the cmp system  will be cost effective or introduced in a timely manner or accepted in the marketplace 
failure by the company to develop or introduce new products and product enhancements in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to the complexity of the company s products  significant delays can occur between a system s introduction and the commencement of commercial shipments 
the company has from time to time experienced delays in the introduction of  and certain technical and manufacturing difficulties with  certain of its systems and enhancements  and may experience such delays and technical and manufacturing difficulties in future introductions or volume production of new systems or enhancements 
in addition  the company may incur substantial unanticipated costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of its future product introductions early in the product s life cycle 
if new products experience reliability or quality problems  the company could encounter a number of problems  including reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collection of accounts receivable and additional service and warranty expenses  all of which events could materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  in the event the company does not manage product transitions successfully  announcements or introductions  or the perception that such events are likely to occur  by either the company or its competitors could adversely affect sales of existing company products 
see market share growth company s cmp system and business research  development and engineering 
cyclical nature of the company s business the company s business depends substantially on the capital expenditures of thin film memory disk media and semiconductor manufacturers  which  in turn  depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for memory disks and semiconductor devices 
sales of capital equipment to these manufacturers are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of the company s total revenue 
these industries are highly cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand  which often have a material adverse effect on the acquisition of capital equipment and other products used in the manufacturing process  including products offered by the company 
these downturns generally have materially adversely affected the business and operating results of capital equipment suppliers  including the company 
the semiconductor and thin film memory disk industries have recently or are currently experiencing downturns which have led many semiconductor and memory disk manufacturers to delay or cancel capital expenditures 
the company s business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected by future downturns in the semiconductor market and the thin film memory disk market 
sales of the company s capital equipment depend  in large part  upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase manufacturing capacity or respond to advances in technology by upgrading or expanding existing manufacturing facilities or constructing new manufacturing facilities  all of which typically involve a significant capital commitment 
certain of the company s capital equipment have lengthy sales cycles while the customer evaluates and receives approvals for the purchase of the company s systems and completes the upgrading or expansion of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities 
the company may expend substantial funds and management effort during the sales cycle 
the cyclicality and rapid technological change present in certain of the industries served by the company may also cause prospective customers to postpone decisions regarding major capital expenditures  including purchases of the company s equipment 
in addition  the need for continued investment in research and development  marketing and customer support limits the company s ability to reduce expenses in response to downturns in the industries it serves 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company s quarterly operating results have historically and may in the future vary significantly due to a number of factors 
historically  a disproportionate share of the company s revenue and operating profit has been attributable to the last two quarters of the company s fiscal year  primarily the fourth quarter 
in particular  the company typically experiences a decline in revenues and operating profit from the fourth fiscal quarter to the first fiscal quarter of the succeeding year 
the company believes that this decline is primarily due to the seasonal buying patterns of its customers 
factors that may influence the company s operating results in a given quarter include i customer demand  such as economic conditions in the memory disk and semiconductor industries  market acceptance of products of both the company and its customers  changes in product mix  and the timing  cancellation or delay of customer orders and shipments  ii competition  such as competitive pressures on prices of the company s products and the introduction or announcement of new products by competitors  iii manufacturing and operations  such as fluctuations in availability and cost of raw materials and production capacity  iv fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  v new product development  such as increased research  development and engineering  as well as marketing  expenses associated with new product introductions  including the effect of transitioning to new or enhanced products  and the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  vi sales and marketing  such as concentrations of customers  and discounts that may be granted to certain customers  and vii the quarterly operating results of the company s joint ventures  which the company accounts for on the equity method  as well as other factors  such as levels of expenses relative to revenue levels  personnel changes and generally prevailing economic conditions 
during a given quarter  a significant portion of the company s revenue may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of machines and systems 
accordingly  a small change in the number of machines and systems actually shipped may cause significant changes in operating results 
moreover  customers may cancel or reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
in addition  because of the significantly different gross margins attributable to the company s two segments  changes in product mix may cause fluctuations in operating results 
further  the lengthy sales cycle for certain of the company s capital equipment may result in the company incurring significant expenses prior to the receipt of customer orders 
in addition  the introduction of new products has in the past contributed  and may continue to contribute  to fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
these same factors also could materially and adversely affect annual results of operations 
in addition  the need for continued investment in research and development  marketing and customer support limits the company s ability to reduce expenses in response to downturns in the industries it serves 
sole or limited sources of supply the company relies to a substantial extent on outside suppliers to manufacture many of the components and subassemblies used in the company s capital equipment  some of which are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
the company s reliance on outside suppliers generally  and a sole or a limited group of suppliers in particular  involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over quality  pricing and timing of delivery of components 
in the past  the company has experienced delays in receiving materials from suppliers  sometimes resulting in delays in the delivery of products by the company 
such delays  or other significant supplier or supply quality issues  may occur in the future  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company 
because the manufacture of certain of these components and subassemblies is specialized and requires long lead times  there can be no assurance that delays or shortages caused by suppliers will not reoccur 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries  or any other circumstance that would require the company to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally  could delay shipment of the company s products  increase its cost of goods sold and have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see business manufacturing and suppliers 
international business in fiscal  and   and  respectively  of the company s total revenue was attributable to sales outside the united states 
in addition  under certain circumstances  products sold to us customers are shipped to those customers overseas facilities 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenue 
sales to customers outside the united states are subject to numerous risks  including exposure to currency fluctuations  the imposition of government controls  the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign and us export laws  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes typically associated with foreign sales  the greater difficulty of administering business overseas and general economic conditions 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
moreover  slurries marketed and distributed by both the company and the fujimi joint venture are purchased from fujimi incorporated  a japanese company 
the company also purchases in japanese yen certain equipment from the far east joint venture that the company then sells in the us and europe 
fluctuations in exchange rates have in the past resulted  and may in the future result  in increases in the cost to the company of such products 
also  because the value of the net assets of the company s foreign subsidiaries and its equity interest in the far east joint venture fluctuate based upon exchange rates and because the company does not hedge the value of such net assets  fluctuations in exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the company s shareholders equity 
certain statements in business  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and certain factors affecting the company s business constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements
