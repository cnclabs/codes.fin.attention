item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s net sales have grown from million in to million in  a compound annual growth rate of 
this growth resulted primarily from strategic acquisitions of established companies which isolyser believes are complementary to the company s objectives to become a leading supplier of disposable and degradable products for use in hospitals and other industries for patient care  occupational safety and management of potentially infectious and hazardous waste 
the company was incorporated in and commenced operations in with the introduction of its sms products 
in  the company introduced its lts products and thereafter introduced others of its safety products and services 
during  the company completed the atkins acquisition and the medsurg acquisition and began to sell standard and custom procedure trays 
because these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method  the company s operating results include the operations of atkins from february   but do not include any of the operating results of medsurg which was acquired on december  on july   the company acquired the infection control drape line of xomed  in exchange for microtek s otology product line  thereby providing microtek greater concentration on its core business 
on september   isolyser completed the white knight acquisition and began the conversion manufacturing of non woven fabric into finished goods such as drapes and gowns 
on november   microtek acquired medi plast  a manufacturer of equipment drapes 
because of all of these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method  the company s operating results do not include the operating results of the acquired operations for periods prior to these respective acquisition dates 
in april   microtek purchased the venodyne division of advanced instruments  inc  which manufactures and markets pneumatic pumps and disposable compression sleeves for use in reducing deep vein thrombosis  and the company s results of operations include the results of venodyne only from the april  acquisition date 
effective september   isolyser completed its acquisition of microtek  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  the company s financial statements have been restated for all periods to combine the financial statements of each of isolyser and microtek 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for were million compared to million for  an increase of 
the increase of million reflects primarily a increase in net sales by white knight as compared to comparable sales by the company in as a result of the september  white knight acquisition  a increase in net sales of microtek primarily as a result of the medi plast  xomed and venodyne acquisitions  and a increase in net sales of procedure trays and related products primarily as a result of increased market penetration 
sales of safety products and services increased in as compared to this increase reflects primarily increased sales of lts during resulting from opening sales of lts to more than one national distributor and increased revenues from the company s onsyte system during resulting from an acquisition transaction consummated during sales by white knight decreased during the latter half of  which may be attributable to the acquisition in july  of sterile concepts  a significant customer of white knight  by maxxim  which is a product competitor of the company 
while sterile concepts remains contractually obligated to purchase a yearly minimum of million of products until june   such acquisition is expected to continue to adversely affect the company s sales in and future periods 
sales by microtek during the fourth quarter were adversely affected by a decision made during the fourth quarter to immediately change the method of selling microtek products by switching to direct sales through the company s sales force and immediately cease sales through independent representatives as part of a strategy to seek to promote long term sales growth 
included in the foregoing sales figures are million in sales of orex degradables during quarter to quarter sales of orex degradables during were flat  which management of the company believes is attributable to having only a small group of hospitals converted to using degradable versus traditional products during management believes that the rate of growth in orex sales has been adversely affected by delays in bringing new orex catalog items to market in quantities sufficient for commercial supply and product performance or quality concerns for certain of the company s orex degradables products 
while management believes that the company s group of orex products currently includes substantially all non woven products most often used in the operating room  the company does not yet manufacture for commercial sale orex degradables film or thermoformed and extruded products such as bowls  basins and utensils 
sales of orex degradables during did not contribute any gross profits to the company s operating results 
management believes that the company will continue to fail to receive profitable margins on sales of orex degradables pending a combination of selling orex degradables in greater volumes  the operation of the company s orex manufacturing plant at higher efficiencies and increasing the unit price for orex degradables to an amount which takes into account the disposal cost savings provided by such products 
the company is currently undertaking a thorough review and analysis of the market position of orex degradables within its various market potentials 
as a part of such review and analysis  the company plans to implement appropriate adjustments to its marketing plan to seek to improve the company s operating results in connection with the sale of orex degradables 
the company s future performance will depend to a substantial degree upon market acceptance of and the company s ability to successfully manufacture  market  deliver and expand its orex degradables line of products at acceptable profit margins 
the company s ability to achieve such objectives is subject to a number of risks described under business risk factors 
gross profit in was million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in included in costs of goods sold during was million in reserves for orex inventory with no comparable charges recorded in these reserves were recognized due to improvements in manufacturing processes realized during the latter portions from rendering various existing inventories obsolete or second quality 
after adjusting gross profits by eliminating these charges  gross profit for would have been 
also negatively impacting gross profit during was unabsorbed overhead included in cost of goods sold by reason of underutilization of manufacturing capacity at the company s arden and abbeville manufacturing plants 
during the latter portions of  the company reduced production at its abbeville plant to more closely align production with product demand 
pending increased utilization of the company s existing manufacturing capacity at its arden and abbeville manufacturing plants and adjusting pricing of orex degradables to take into account disposal cost savings over traditional products  the overhead of the company incurred through its arden and abbeville plants will continue to negatively impact profit margins 
the company s ability to achieve such objectives is subject to a number of risks described under business risk factors including without limitation risks of new products and manufacturing and supply risks 
selling and marketing expenses were million or of net sales in as compared to million or of net sales in this increase was primarily due to the increase in commissions on increased sales  increased travel and promotional expenses and the acquisition of white knight

during  the company also incurred transactional costs associated with the microtek acquisition of million with no comparable charges during the resulting loss from operations was million in as compared to million in after adjusting the operating loss to exclude million of charges for inventory reserves  restructuring and the microtek transaction expenses  the operating loss would have been approximately  for interest expense net of interest income was million in as compared to interest income net of interest expense of million in the increase in interest expense was primarily due to interest on debt incurred in connection with the microtek acquisition and inventory purchases and to decreased interest income reflecting a reduction in short term investments during and a lower interest rate on those investments 
losses from joint venture was  and  in and  respectively 
provisions for income taxes reflect a benefit for of  compared to a tax expense of  in the effective tax rate in differs from the statutory rate due primarily to the amortization of a portion of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes  non deductible microtek acquisition costs and certain reserves for inventory considered temporary differences for tax purposes 
the company recorded a  extraordinary loss from the refinancing of isolyser s and microtek s credit facilities  net of a  tax benefit 
the resulting net loss was million in as compared to a net loss of  in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for were million compared to million for  an increase of 
the increase in net sales of million reflects primarily the net sales of white knight of million from the september  acquisition date  a net increase in in sales of procedure trays and related products of over corresponding sales and an increase of in microtek net sales during over the increase in sales of procedure trays and related products is net of a million decrease in sales of bone marrow needles resulting from the loss of the then sole customer for bone marrow needles 
the company believes that the increase in sales of procedure trays and related products reflect increased sales to customers seeking to participate in the anticipated increases in the availability of orex degradables products as well as the company s strategy to aggressively market and price new procedure tray business to build market share 
the rate of increase for sales of procedure trays and related products decreased during the latter portions of as the company s distributors reduced inventory carrying levels of such products 
the company believes that its major distributors have substantially completed these inventory adjustments 
on july   microtek completed the exchange of microtek s otology product line for xomed s drape line 
primarily as a result of such exchange  sales of the company s equipment drapes increased during as compared to and sales of otology products decreased by during as compared to in addition  sales of fluid control products decreased by during as compared to  which decrease was primarily the result of lower prices and timing of certain sales contracts 
safety products and services sales increased during over the major portion of such increase reflects increased revenues from the company s onsyte system during over following the acquisition of safewaste  as well as the completion by baxter of its adjustments for inventory levels and sales by the company of lts to other distributors following the expiration of baxter s exclusive rights to market lts 
although small quantities of orex degradables were sold in the first three quarters of  the company s production facility for producing non woven fabric was not producing commercial quantities until into the third quarter  and therefore related finished products were not available until the fourth quarter  during which  of orex degradables products were sold in custom procedure trays and sterile packs 
sales of orex degradables in did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company s future performance will depend to a substantial degree upon market acceptance of and the company s ability to successfully manufacture  market  deliver and expand its orex degradables line of products

gross profit in was million or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales in the gross profit on procedure trays decreased in as result of aggressive marketing efforts and pricing strategies to capture increasing procedure tray business in an industry where margins have generally declined in recent months 
further negatively impacting gross profit margins were the start up costs associated with the arden non woven fabric and abbeville woven production facilities  and loss of the relatively low volume but high margin bone marrow needle business in mid year partially offsetting these margin declines was the effect of microtek and white knight net sales which had a and gross profit margin  respectively 
selling and marketing expenses were million or of net sales in compared to million or of net sales in the company invested in increased selling and marketing expenses in late and early in anticipation of the orex rollout early in  which was delayed due to the aforementioned delay in the availability of orex degradables product from the company s non woven fabric facility

amortization of intangibles increased to million in compared to million in  reflecting the continued amortization expenses resulting from the acquisitions of medsurg and atkins and additional amortization expenses in as a result of the white knight and safewaste acquisitions 
amortization expenses will continue to materially impact results of operations in the future 
the resulting loss from operations was million in compared to  in interest income  net of million of interest expense  was million in  compared to  million in  net of  of interest expense 
the foregoing reflects the significant increase in cash equivalents after the october initial public offering 
at december  all of the investments were in u 
s 
government or government backed securities which mature in days or less 
the increase in interest expense reflects the financing of a portion of the capital expenditures relating to the non woven facility in arden  north carolina in january and additional indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of white knight 
interest rates on both interest income and interest expense have declined slightly from the comparable prior year periods 
provision for income taxes reflected an expense in of  compared to  in the effective tax rate in differs from the statutory tax rate due to the amortization of a portion of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes and the allocation of certain tax benefits to reduce goodwill in connection with the acquisition of white knight 
the resulting net loss was  in compared to a net loss of million before cumulative effect of change in accounting principles in on january   the company adopted sfas no

during  cash expenditures for property and equipment and deposits on machinery and equipment were million  down from million in additionally  approximately million of cash was used to acquire venodyne and other smaller businesses 
the company believes it has substantially completed required capital expenditures to support the manufacture and sale of the company s orex degradables based on the company s existing available manufacturing capacity 
new manufacturing techniques or technology could cause the company to incur capital expenditures for manufacturing capabilities not currently planned 
at december   the company had outstanding commitments to purchase approximately  of equipment  and additional commitments of approximately million for the purchase of orex inventory primarily pva fiber 
during  the company acquired a pva fiber manufacturing facility located in charlotte  north carolina 
this facility remains in the developmental stages as the company experiments with pva fiber manufacturing as well as other compounds 
the company is currently substantially dependent upon third party manufacturers and suppliers located in the people s republic of china and outside the united states for the raw materials and certain of the finished goods comprising the orex degradables line 
such dependence exposes the company to various risks concerning the costs and availability of raw materials and finished products
