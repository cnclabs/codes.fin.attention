development of new inns the company believes that attractive opportunities exist for the development of new inns in certain markets in the southeastern united states 
accordingly  the company intends to continue developing new inns in targeted communities 
with operating inns in georgia  alabama and south carolina  the company plans to continue developing inns in those states as well as in north carolina  tennessee and florida 
at december   the company had a total of inns under development  including inns under construction  and contracts to acquire parcels of land on which additional inns are expected to be constructed during in addition  the company may consider long term ground leases for future inn locations 
the following sets forth the location of new inns under construction by the company at december   which have opened or are expected to open in each such inn initially has or will have rooms 
the inns in oakwood  forest city and union opened in january or february alabama auburn  oxford  tuscaloosa georgia oakwood north carolina forest city  laurinburg  sanford  wilson south carolina union tennessee decherd  tullahoma the company believes that it benefits significantly from its strategy of developing new inns rather than acquiring existing properties and rehabilitating  refurbishing or re flagging them because of the experience and track record of the company  the contractor see the contractor  below and the operator in the development  construction and operation of inns 
in evaluating potential development sites  the company targets communities with strong industrial bases sufficient to attract business travelers 
these communities typically have significant manufacturing facilities  state and federal government installations  or colleges and universities 
the company strives to locate its inns in proximity to family style restaurants and targets markets which offer local community events eg annual festivals  fishing tournaments  collegiate football games and other athletic events  graduation ceremonies  etc 
and or tourist and recreational facilities eg lakes  golf courses  hunting areas  etc 
attracting groups and individual discretionary and leisure travelers 
the inns are generally located in communities ranging in population from  to  the company believes that land costs in the company s target markets are generally lower than similar costs in major metropolitan areas 
expansion of existing inns the company intends to continue to expand existing inns whenever market conditions warrant 
a typical expansion involves adding a stand alone to room structure to the standard room inn 
to date  inns have undergone expansion and  at december   one additional inn  located in gaffney  south carolina  was undergoing a room expansion 
because the inns are initially constructed with the office and lobby  swimming pool and fitness center on sites generally large enough for future expansions  the incremental cost per room of expansions is lower than for new inns 
accordingly  the company can earn attractive returns on its investment by expanding inns in markets with strong room demand 
in addition  the design of the standard inn permits the expansion of an inn with relatively little disruption to the existing inn s operations 
also  as compared to the development of new inns  expansion of existing inns is a relatively lower risk growth strategy since the company has an opportunity to assess local room demand and market trends based on its direct experience in developing and owning the existing inn 
the contractor it is anticipated that jameson development company  llc  the successor to jameson construction company  will act as general contractor contractor for new inns built by the company as well as expansions of existing inns 
jameson construction company is wholly owned by kitchin investments  inc  an entity wholly owned by thomas w 
kitchin see employees  below  and item certain relationships and related transactions cost reimbursement agreement 
as of september   jameson construction company assigned all its contracts to jameson development company  llc  a company wholly owned by thomas w 
kitchin and his spouse  which was formed in to act as the contractor with the same management and employees as jameson construction company 
each construction contract for a new inn or a group of inns provides for a fixed turnkey price for all work performed under the contract subject to reduction  however  if the contractor s profits as defined in the construction contract exceed 
each such construction contract is reviewed by an independent architectural firm and subject to approval by a majority of the company s independent directors 
the average turnkey price for the new inns opened during was approximately  the contract price excludes the cost of the land and closing costs  but includes the costs of constructing and equipping the inns and related fitness centers  including interest charges incurred by the company on the associated construction debt during construction 
the average turnkey contract price for each expansion of an existing inn in was approximately  per room  excluding the amount of any extraordinary site development costs

internal growth through percentage rent  the company participates in any increases in room revenues generated through increases in occupancy rates and average daily room rates adr of the inns by the operator 
total rent  including base rent and percentage rent  is limited however  for each calendar year to of room revenues 
see the lease  above 
the operator practices aggressive market sensitive pricing  increasing room rates at particular inns as market conditions in the specific communities warrant 
the inns site managers receive a significant portion of their compensation based on achieving specified monthly room revenues and annual expense controls 
the operator promotes an aggressive marketing program which focuses on local efforts directed to the business community in each inn s market 
see marketing  below 
marketing marketing of the inns focuses on local efforts directed to the business community in the city or town where the particular inn is located 
one of the primary responsibilities of an inn s manager is to make sales calls on local chambers of commerce  businesses  factories  government installations and colleges and universities 
the goal of the sales call is to familiarize local business people with the inn in their community and solicit their recommendation of the inn to business travelers visiting communities where inns are located  including both individual discretionary travelers as well as groups attending family or community events 
the company employs billboards and other similar types of advertising and has an number to facilitate reservations 
competition the hotel industry is highly competitive 
each of the inns is located in an area that includes other hotels  many of which are competitive with the inns in their community 
the number of competitive hotels in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on occupancy  adr and revenue per available room revpar of the inns 
moreover  the inns are generally located in smaller communities where the entry of even one additional competitor into the market may materially affect the financial performance of the inn in that community 
the company competes on the basis of price  quality and value 
the company s competition is made up primarily of limited service hotels in the southeastern united states operating under national franchises which have greater financial resources than the company  substantial advertising budgets  national reservation systems  marketing programs and greater name recognition 
regulations environmental matters 
under various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to properly remediate such property  may adversely affect the owner s ability to borrow using such real property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person 
while the company has not incurred any such costs in connection with its ownership of the inns  the company may be potentially liable for such costs 
the company generally develops inns in areas where the historical use of the land is well known and often agricultural 
management is not aware of any potential material liability or claims for which the company may be responsible 
however  no assurances can be given that i there are no material claims or liabilities related to real property ownership by the company  ii future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability on the company  or iii the current environmental condition of the inns will not be affected by operation of the inns  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the inns such as the presence of underground storage tanks or by third parties 
under the terms of the lease  the company indemnifies the operator against environmental liabilities  except those caused by the acts or negligent failures of the operator 
in addition  the lease provides that the operator will indemnify the company against environmental liabilities caused by the operator s acts or negligent failures  although the operator s financial condition may limit the value of such indemnity and  in any event  such indemnity will not apply to or protect the company against past unknown violations and related liabilities 
see the lease  above 
the company believes that the inns are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and does not anticipate that it will be required in the foreseeable future to expend any material amounts in order to comply with such ordinances and regulations 
the company has not been notified by any governmental authority  nor is it otherwise aware  of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances in connection with any of its present or former properties 
americans with disabilities act 
under the americans with disabilities act of the ada  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
in addition to remedial costs  noncompliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
the company believes that all existing inns are substantially in compliance with these requirements and intends to construct future inns in accordance with such requirements as well 
in  the company engaged a disabilities consultant to make recommendations to the company regarding the inns compliance with the ada 
the consultant submitted a report recommending a number of improvements for access to and use by disabled persons with respect to certain of the inns then in operation  which improvements were made 
the company has also incorporated such consultant s recommendations into the construction of new inns

policies and objectives with respect to certain activities the following is a discussion of the company s investment objectives and policies  financing policies and policies with respect to certain other activities 
these policies may be amended or revised from time to time at the sole discretion of the board of directors 
no assurance can be given that the company s investment objectives will be attained or that the value of the company will not decrease 
investment objectives and policies 
the company s investment objective is to provide  quarterly cash distributions and achieve long term capital appreciation through increases in cash flow and the value of the company 
the company will seek to accomplish these objectives through the ownership and leasing of the inns to the operator  selective development of additional inns in the united states  the operator s increases in the inns room revenues and  where deemed appropriate  renovations and expansions of these properties 
a key criterion for new investments will be that they offer the opportunity for growth in funds from operations and cash available for distribution 
for definitions and calculation of funds from operations and cash available from operations  see item selected financial data and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funds from operations  cash available for distribution 
the company anticipates that all of its activities will be conducted directly  although the company may participate with other entities in property ownership  through joint ventures  partnerships or other types of co ownership 
the company currently intends to invest only in inns  although the company may also hold temporary cash investments from time to time pending investment or distribution to shareholders 
the company may purchase or lease properties for long term investment  expand and improve the inns  or sell such properties  in whole or in part  when circumstances warrant 
equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness which have priority over the equity interest of the company 
while the company emphasizes equity real estate investments  it may  in its discretion  invest in mortgages  stock of other reits and other real estate interests 
such mortgage investments may include participating or convertible mortgages 
however  the company has not invested previously in mortgages and stock of other reits  an does not presently intend to do so 
dispositions 
the company has no current intention to dispose of any of the inns  although it reserves the right to do so if  based upon management s periodic review of the company s portfolio  the board of directors determines that such action would be in the best interests of the company 
for a description of certain tax consequences arising from the disposition of an inn  see federal income tax considerations  below 
financing 
in january  the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that provides for the issuance of an aggregate of up to million in common stock  preferred stock and common stock warrants to be offered and sold from time to time 
the company intends to use the net proceeds  if any  from any sale of securities under such registration statement for the repayment of existing indebtedness  working capital and general corporate purposes 
in the event that the board of directors determines to raise additional equity capital  the board has the authority  without shareholder approval  to issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock of the company in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
existing shareholders would have no preemptive right to purchase shares issued in any offering  and any such offering might cause a dilution of a shareholder s investment in the company 
it is anticipated that any additional borrowings will be made directly by the company 
indebtedness incurred by the company may be in the form of bank borrowings  secured and unsecured  and publicly and privately placed debt instruments 
such indebtedness may be recourse to all or any part of the property of the company or may be limited to the particular property to which the indebtedness relates 
the proceeds from any borrowings by the company may be used for the payment of distributions  working capital  to refinance existing indebtedness or to finance acquisitions  expansions or development of new inns 
at december   the company had outstanding an aggregate of approximately million of mortgage debt  including approximately million in construction debt 
the construction debt provides for total borrowings of million and is secured by mortgages on nine inns 
the company adheres to a policy of limiting its outstanding indebtedness to of the aggregate appraised value of the inns the debt limit 
the outstanding indebtedness at december  represented approximately of the aggregate appraised value of the inns 
the company s organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that the company may incur 
accordingly  the board of directors of the company could change the current policies of the company and the company could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increased risk of default on the obligations of the company and in an increase in debt service requirements 
such an increase could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company  the company s ability to make dividend distributions to its shareholders and could  as a result  jeopardize the company s status as a reit 
see federal income tax considerations  below 
working capital reserves 
the company s policy is to maintain working capital reserves and when not sufficient  access to borrowings in amounts that the board of directors determines to be adequate to meet normal contingencies in connection with the operation of the company s business and investments 
policy regarding capital expenditures

the company believes that an amount equal to of operator s aggregate room revenues will be sufficient to fund this requirement 
as of december   such amount was  which  together with the  expended for capital expenditures from july  to december   represents of aggregate room revenues for the same period

conflicts of interest 
because of thomas w 
kitchin s ownership in and positions with the company  the operator  the contractor and kitchin investments  inc  there are inherent conflicts of interest in the construction of new inns and expansion of existing inns by the contractor and in the company s dealings with the operator under the lease and with kitchin investments  inc under the cost reimbursement agreement

federal income tax considerations the following summary of material federal income tax considerations regarding the company is based on current law and does not purport to deal with all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular shareholders in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances  or to certain types of shareholders including insurance companies  tax exempt organizations  financial institutions or broker dealers  foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws 
each stockholder is advised to consult his own tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences to him of the purchase  ownership and sale of the shares and of the company s election to be taxed as a reit  including the federal  state  local  foreign and other tax consequences of such purchase  ownership  sale and election and of potential changes in applicable tax laws 
taxation of the company the company made an election to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  commencing with its taxable year beginning january  the company made such election at the time of the filing of its federal income tax return for the company believes that commencing with such taxable year  it was organized and has operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit under the code 
the company intends to continue to operate in such a manner  but no assurance can be given that it has qualified or will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified 
the sections of the code relating to qualification and operation as a reit are highly technical and complex 
the following discussion sets forth the material aspects of the code sections that govern the federal income tax treatment of a reit and its shareholders 
this discussion is qualified in its entirety by applicable code provisions  treasury regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof 
conner winters  a professional corporation conner winters  has acted as counsel to the company in connection with the offering and the company s election to be taxed as a reit 
commencing with the company s taxable year beginning january   the company was organized and believes it has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a reit and that its proposed method of operations will continue to meet the code requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under current code provisions 
the company s qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon its ability to meet  through actual annual operating results  distribution levels  stock ownership requirements and various qualification requirements imposed under the code and discussed below 
no assurance can be given that the actual results of the company s operations for any particular taxable year will satisfy such requirements 
for a discussion of the tax consequences of the failure to qualify as a reit  see failure to qualify  below 
as long as the company qualifies for taxation as a reit  it generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on its net income that is currently distributed to shareholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and shareholder levels that generally results from investment in a corporation 
however  the company will be subject to federal income or excise tax as follows first  the company will be taxed at regular corporate rates on its reit taxable income  which is defined generally as taxable income subject to certain adjustments  including net capital gains  less dividends to shareholders 
second  the company will generally be subject to the alternative minimum tax if reit taxable income plus any tax adjustments and preferences is greater than dividends paid to shareholders 
third  if the company has i net income from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property which is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade of business or ii other non qualifying net income from foreclosure property  it will be subject to tax at the highest corporate rate on such income 
fourth  if the company has net income from prohibited transactions generally certain sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business  such income will be subject to a tax 
fifth  if the company should fail to satisfy the or gross income tests discussed below and has nonetheless maintained its qualification as a reit because certain other requirements have been met  it will be subject to a tax on the net income attributable to the greater of the amount by which the company fails the or gross income tests 
sixth  generally  if the company should fail to distribute to its shareholders during each calendar year an amount equal to its required distribution  it will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution amount over the amount actually distributed for the year 
the amount of required distribution is equal to the sum of i of its ordinary income for such year  ii of its reit capital gain net income for such year and iii the amount  if any  of the required distribution for the previous year over the amount actually distributed for that year 
in addition  pursuant to irs notice  if during the year period the recognition period beginning on the first day of the first taxable year for which the company qualified as a reit  the company recognizes gain on the disposition of any asset held by the company as of the beginning of such recognition period  then  to the extent of the excess of a the fair market value of such asset as of the beginning of such recognition period over b the company s adjusted basis in such asset as of the beginning of the recognition period the built in gain  such built in gain  which may be reduced by certain net operating loss carry forwards of the company  will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate  pursuant to regulations that have not yet been promulgated 
the recognition period began january  and will expire december  further  if the company acquires any asset from a c corporation in a transaction in which the basis of the asset in the company s hands is determined by reference to the basis of the asset or any other property in the hands of the c corporation  and the company recognizes gain on the disposition of such asset during the ten year period beginning on the date on which such asset was acquired by the company  then  to the extent of the built in gain  such gain will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate  pursuant to regulations that have not yet been promulgated 
the amount of the company s built in gain based on the appraisals obtained in connection with its initial public offering is approximately million and will discourage a disposition by the company of any inn held at the time of such offering until after requirements for qualification the code defines a reit as a corporation  trust or association which is managed by one or more trustees or directors  the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest  which would be taxable as a domestic corporation  but for sections through of the code  which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the code  the beneficial ownership of which is held by or more persons  at any time during the last half of each taxable year not more than in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities  which makes an election to be a reit and satisfies all relevant filing and other administrative requirements established by the irs that must be met in order to elect and maintain reit status  which uses a calendar year for federal income tax purposes and complies with the record keeping requirements of the code and treasury regulations promulgated thereunder  and which meets certain other tests  described below  regarding the nature of its income and assets 
the code provides that conditions to  inclusive  must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition must be met during at least days of a taxable year of months  or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than months 
the company has met since the closing of the initial public offering  and currently does meet  all of such definitional requirements 
income tests in order for the company to maintain its qualification as a reit  it must satisfy three gross income tests annually 
first  at least of the company s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must consist of defined types of income derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including rents from real property and  in certain circumstances  interest or qualified temporary investment income 
second  at least of the company s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived from such real property or temporary investments  and from dividends and other types of interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities 
third  short term gain from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities  gain from prohibited transactions and gain on the sale or other disposition of certain real property held for less than four years apart from involuntary conversions and sales of foreclosure property must represent less than of the company s gross income for each taxable year 
rents received by the company under the lease will qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income requirements for a reit described above only if several conditions are met 
first  the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person 
however  an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term rents from real property solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 
therefore  the percentage rent provisions of the lease should not disqualify rental income received from the operator 
second  the code provides that rents received from a tenant  directly or indirectly  will not qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income tests if the reit  or a direct or indirect owner of or more of the reit  directly or constructively owns or more of such tenant a related party tenant 
since the change date  the company has satisfied and will use its best efforts to continue to satisfy this requirement 
therefore  the operator is not and should not become a related party tenant of the company by reason of the company s adherence to the ownership limit and the related party limit 
third  if rent attributable to personal property  leased in connection with a lease of real property  is greater than of the total rent received under the lease  then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as rents from real property 
applicable code provisions provide that with respect to each lease  rent attributable to the personal property for the taxable year is that amount which bears the same ratio to total rent as the average of a reit s adjusted bases of all personal property at the beginning and at the end of each taxable year bears to the average of the reit s aggregate adjusted bases of all real and personal property at the beginning and at the end of such taxable year 
since january   the company s rental income attributable to personal property has been and will continue to be less than  however  should the resulting rental income attributable to personal property exceed of all rental income  a portion of the personal property may be sold by the company to the operator with the lease payments adjusted accordingly 
finally  for rents received to qualify as rents from real property  the reit generally must not operate or manage the leased property or furnish or render services to the tenants of such property  other than through an independent contractor from whom the reit derives no revenue  provided  however  the company may directly perform certain services other than services which are considered rendered to the occupant of the property 
the company has not  does not and will not knowingly i charge rent for any property that is based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person except by reason of being based on a percentage of receipts or sales  as described above  ii rent any property to a related party tenant  iii lease personal property in connection with the rental of the inns which would cause the rental income attributable to such personal property to exceed of the amount of total rental income  or iv perform services considered to be rendered for the occupants of the inns other than through an independent contractor 
under the lease  the operator has leased the land  buildings  improvements  furnishings  and equipment comprising the inns from the company for a year term 
the operator pays the company total rent  including base rent and percentage rent 
see item business the lease 
in order for the total rent received from the operator to constitute rents from real property  the lease must be respected as a true lease for federal income tax purposes and not treated as a service contract  joint venture or some other type of arrangement 
the determination of whether the lease is a true lease depends on an analysis of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances 
in addition  pursuant to code section e  a service contract  partnership agreement  or some other type of arrangement may be treated instead as a lease of property if the contract  agreement or arrangement is properly treated as a lease of property  taking into account all relevant factors  including whether or not i the service recipient is in physical possession of the property  ii the service recipient controls the property  iii the service recipient has a significant economic or possessory interest in the property eg  the property s use is likely to be dedicated to the service recipient for a substantial portion of the useful life of the property  the service recipient shares the risk that the property will decline in value  the service recipient shares in any appreciation in the value of the property  the service recipient shares in savings in the property s operating costs  or the service recipient bears the risk of damage to or loss of the property  iv the service provider does not bear any risk of substantially diminished receipts or substantially increased expenditures if there is nonperformance under the lease  v the service provider does not use the property concurrently to provide significant services to entities unrelated to the service recipient and vi the contract price does not substantially exceed the rental value of the property for the term of the lease 
under the lease  i the operator has the right to exclusive possession  use and quiet enjoyment of the inns during the term of the lease  ii the operator bears the cost of  and is responsible for daily maintenance and repair of the inns  other than the cost of maintaining underground utilities and structural elements including the roofs of the improvements  iii the operator dictates how the inns are operated  maintained  and improved and bears all of the costs and expenses of operating the inns including the cost of any inventory used in their operation during the term of the lease other than real and personal property taxes  casualty  liability and other types of insurance and equipment and the maintenance of structural elements  roofs and underground utilities  iv the operator benefits from any savings in the costs of operating the inns during the term of the lease  v in the event of damage or destruction to an inn  the operator is at economic risk because it will be obligated to restore the property to its prior condition and bear all costs of such restoration in excess of any insurance proceeds except  under certain circumstances  during the last six months of the term of the lease  vi the operator has indemnified the company against all liabilities imposed on the company during the term of the lease by reason of injury to persons or damage to property occurring at the inns or due to the operator s use  management  maintenance or repair of the inns  and vii the operator is obligated to pay substantial fixed rent for the term of the lease 
in addition  the total rent under the lease does not substantially exceed the fair rental value of the inns 
pursuant to irs revenue ruling  if one or more of the following conditions are present  the lease will instead be considered as a conditional contract for purchase and sale of the inns i portions of the periodic payments are made specifically applicable to an equity interest in the property to be acquired by the lessee  ii the lessee will acquire title upon the payment of a stated amount of rentals under the contract which it is required to make  iii the total amount which the lessee is required to pay for a relatively short period of use constitutes an inordinately large proportion of the total sum required to be paid to secure the transfer of the title  iv the agreed rental payments materially exceed the current fair rental value  v the property may be acquired under a purchase option at a price which is nominal in relation to the value of the property at the time when the option may be exercised  as determined at the time of entering into the original agreement  or which is a relatively small amount when compared with the total payments which are required to be made and vi some portion of the periodic payments is specifically designated as interest or is otherwise readily recognizable as the equivalent of interest 
under the lease  i no portion of the total rent has been or will be applied to any equity interest in the inns to be acquired by the operator  ii the operator has not acquired and will not be acquiring title to the inns upon the payment of a stated amount of either base rent or percentage rent  iii the total rent does not and will not materially exceed the current fair rental value of the inns  iv the inns may not be acquired by the operator under a purchase option and v no portion of either base rent or percentage rent has been or will be specifically designated as interest or will be recognizable as the equivalent of interest 
based on the foregoing  the company believes that the lease will be treated as a true lease for federal income tax purposes 
however  no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge the tax treatment of the lease  or  if it does  that it will not be successful 
if the lease is recharacterized as a service contract  partnership agreement  or some other type of arrangement rather than a true lease  part or all of the payments that the company receives from the operator may not satisfy the various requirements for qualification as rents from real property 
in that case  the company likely would not be able to satisfy either the or gross income tests and  as a result  would fail to qualify as a reit 
any gross income derived from a prohibited transaction is taken into account in applying the income test necessary to qualify as a reit and the net income from that transaction is subject to a tax 
the term prohibited transaction generally includes a sale or other disposition of property other than foreclosure property that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
none of the company s assets are or have been held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its business and the sale of an inn and associated property will not be in the ordinary course of business of the company 
whether property is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends  however  on the facts and circumstances in effect from time to time  including those related to a particular property 
nevertheless  the company believes that it has since january   complied and will attempt to continue to comply with the terms of the safe harbor provisions in the code prescribing when asset sales will not be characterized as prohibited transactions 
complete assurance cannot be given  however  that the company can comply with the safe harbor provisions of the code or avoid owning property that may be characterized as property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
if the company fails to satisfy one or both of the or gross income tests for any taxable year  it may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if it is entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code 
these relief provisions will generally be available if i the company s failure to meet such tests is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect  ii the company attaches a schedule of the sources of its gross income to its return  and iii any incorrect information on such schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax 
it is not possible  however  to state whether in all circumstances the company would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 
however  no relief provisions are available if the of gross income test is violated 
as discussed above  even if these relief provisions apply  a tax would be imposed which would be equal to the excess of or of the company s gross income over the company s qualifying income in the relevant category  whichever is greater  multiplied by the ratio that reit taxable income bears to gross income for the taxable year with certain adjustments 
asset tests at the close of each quarter of the company s taxable year  it must also satisfy three tests relating to the nature of its assets 
first  at least of the value of the company s total assets must be represented by real estate assets which means i real property including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property  ii shares in other reits and iii stock or debt instruments held for not more than one year purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long term at least five years debt offering of the company  iv cash  cash items including receivables and government securities 
second  not more than of the company s total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the asset class 
third  of the investments included in the asset class  the value of any one issuer s securities owned by the company may not exceed of the value of the company s total assets and the company may not own more than of such issuer s outstanding voting securities 
the company has satisfied these asset tests since december  and it will use its best efforts to continue to satisfy such tests in the future 
after meeting the assets tests at the close of any quarter  the company will not lose its status as a reit for failure to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values 
if the failure to satisfy the asset tests results from an acquisition of securities or other property during a quarter  the failure can be cured by disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets within days after the close of that quarter 
the company believes that it maintains adequate records of the value of its assets to ensure compliance with the asset test and intends to take such other action within days after the close of any quarter as may be required to cure any noncompliance 
however  there can be no assurance that such action will always be successful 
annual distribution requirements the company  in order to qualify as a reit  is required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to its shareholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i of the reit taxable income of the company computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and any net capital gain and ii of the net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus b the sum of certain items of noncash income 
in addition  if the company disposes of any asset during its recognition period  the company will be required  pursuant to irs regulations which have not yet been promulgated  to distribute at least of the built in gain after tax  if any  recognized on the disposition of such asset 
such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate  or in the following taxable year if declared before the company timely files its tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration 
to the extent that the company does not distribute all of its net capital gain or distributes at least  but less than of its reit taxable income  as adjusted  it will be subject to tax thereon at regular corporate tax rates 
furthermore  as explained above in taxation of the company  if the company should fail to distribute its required distribution during each calendar year  the company would be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts actually distributed 
since january   the company has made  and hereafter intends to make  timely distributions sufficient to satisfy all annual distribution requirements 
however  it is possible that  from time to time  the company may experience timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of that income and deduction of such expenses in arriving at its reit taxable income 
in addition  as explained above  in the event of the foreclosure of an inn by a mortgage lender  any debt discharge income would be subject to the annual distribution requirement even though the company would receive no cash as a consequence of a foreclosure 
therefore  the company could have less cash available for distribution than would be necessary to meet its annual distribution requirement or to avoid federal corporate income tax with respect to capital gain or the nondeductible excise tax imposed on certain undistributed income 
to meet the distribution requirement necessary to qualify as a reit or to avoid federal income tax with respect to capital gain or the excise tax  it could be necessary for the company to borrow funds 
under certain circumstances  the company may be able to rectify a failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying dividends to shareholders in a later year 
if the company declares a dividend before the date on which its tax return is due for a taxable year including extensions and distributes the amount of such dividend to shareholders in the month period following the close of such taxable year  such subsequent year dividend may be deductible by the company in computing its reit taxable income for the immediately preceding year 
the distribution of such dividend must be made no later than the date of the first regular dividend payment made after the declaration and distribution of such dividend and the company must elect such treatment in its return 
shareholders receiving subsequent year distributions are taxable on such distributions in the year of actual receipt except in the following case 
any distributions declared by the company in october  november or december of any year payable to a shareholder of record on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by the company and received by the shareholder on december  provided that the distribution is actually paid by the company during january of the following calendar year 
however  if the company actually pays the declared distributions before december  the distributions will be treated as both paid by the company and received by the shareholders on the actual dates paid and received  respectively 
if  as a result of an audit by the irs  the reit taxable income for a prior taxable year is increased  the company may elect to distribute an additional deficiency dividend  as defined under section of the code  and claim an additional deduction for dividends paid for such taxable year in order to meet the annual distribution requirement 
all deficiency dividends must be distributed within days after the final determination of an audit  and the claim for such deficiency dividends must be filed within days of such determination 
the company would also be liable for the payment of interest charges on the amount of the deficiency dividend 
however  the payment of such dividends would ensure that the company s qualification as a reit would not be jeopardized due to a failure to meet its annual distribution requirement 
failure to qualify if the company fails to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year  and the relief provisions do not apply  the company will be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
distributions to shareholders in any year in which the company fails to qualify will not be deductible by the company nor will they be required to be made 
in such event  to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits  all distributions to shareholders will be taxable as ordinary income  and  subject to certain limitations of the code  corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction such deduction is not available to corporate distributees so long as the company qualifies as a reit 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  the company will also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the company ceased to qualify as a reit 
taxation of shareholders tax consequences to non tax exempt us shareholders 
as long as the company qualifies as a reit  distributions made to the company s taxable us shareholders from current or accumulated earnings and profits and not designated as capital gain dividends will be taken into account by such us shareholders as ordinary income in the year they are received and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporations 
such distributions will be treated as portfolio income and not as income from passive activities 
accordingly  shareholders will not be able to apply any passive losses against such income 
distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as long term capital gains to the extent they do not exceed the company s actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which a shareholder has held its stock 
however  corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 
distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a us shareholder to the extent such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of such us shareholder s shares  but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such shares 
to the extent that distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a us shareholder s shares  such distributions will be included in income as long term capital gain or short term capital gain if the shares have been held for one year or less assuming the shares are held as a capital asset by the us shareholder 
moreover  us shareholders may not include in their income tax returns any net operating losses or capital losses of the company 
finally  in general  any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares by a us shareholder who has held such shares for six months or less after applying certain holding period rules  will be treated as a long term capital loss to the extent of distributions from the company required to be treated by such shareholder as long term capital gain 
information reporting requirements and backup withholding 
the company will report to its us shareholders and the irs the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld  if any 
under the backup withholding rules  a us shareholder may be subject to backup withholding at the rate of with respect to distributions paid unless such holder a is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories and  when required  demonstrates this fact  or b provides a taxpayer identification number  certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding  and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules 
a shareholder that does not provide the company with his correct taxpayer identification number may also be subject to penalties imposed by the irs 
any amount paid as backup withholding will be creditable against the shareholder s income tax liability 
in addition  the company may be required to withhold a portion of capital gain distributions to any shareholders who fail to certify their non foreign status to the company 
see taxation of non us shareholders  below 
taxation of tax exempt shareholders 
distributions by the company to a us shareholder that is a tax exempt entity should not constitute unrelated business taxable income as defined in section a of the code ubti  provided that the tax exempt entity has not financed the acquisition of its shares with acquisition indebtedness within the meaning of section c of the code and the shares are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the tax exempt entity 
in addition  if the company is considered to be a pension held reit  then a portion of the dividends paid to qualified trusts any trust defined under section a and exempt from tax under section a that owns more than percent by value in the reit may be considered ubti 
a pension held reit is a reit that is held by one qualified trust holding no more than by value of the interests in the reit or by one or more qualified trusts each of whom owns more than by value holding in the aggregate more than by value of the interests in the reit 
the company does not expect to be a pension held reit 
taxation of non us shareholders 
the rules governing united states federal income taxation of nonresident alien individuals  foreign corporations  foreign partnerships and other foreign shareholders collectively  non us shareholders are complex and no attempt will be made herein to provide more than a summary of such rules 
non us shareholders should consult with their own tax advisors to determine the impact of federal  state and local income tax laws with regard to their investment in shares  including any reporting requirements 
distributions to non us shareholders that are not attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by the company of united states real property interests and not designated by the company as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent their source is current or accumulated earnings and profits of the company 
such distributions will ordinarily be subject to a withholding tax equal to of the gross amount of the distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax 
however  if income from a non us shareholder s investment in the shares is treated as effectively connected with the non us shareholder s conduct of a united states trade or business  the non us shareholder generally will be subject to a tax at graduated rates  in the same manner as us shareholders are taxed with respect to such distributions and may also be subject to the branch profits tax in the case of a shareholder that is a foreign corporation 
the company expects to withhold united states income tax at the rate of on the gross amount of any such distributions made to a non us shareholder unless i a lower treaty rate applies or ii the non us shareholder files an irs form with the company claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income within the meaning of section of the code 
distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits of the company will not be taxable to a shareholder to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder s shares  but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such shares 
to the extent that distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a non us shareholder s shares  such distributions will give rise to tax liability if the non us shareholder would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or disposition of his shares in the company  as described below 
if it cannot be determined at the time a distribution is made whether or not such distribution will be in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits  the distribution will be subject to withholding at a rate 
further  pursuant to recently enacted legislation  the company will be required to withhold of any distribution in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits 
however  amounts withheld may be refundable if it is subsequently determined that such distribution was in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits of the company and the amount withheld exceeded the non us shareholder s non us tax liability  if any 
for any year in which the company qualifies as a reit  distributions that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by the company of united states real property interests will be taxed to a non us shareholder under the provisions of the foreign investment in real property tax act of firpta 
under firpta  distributions attributable to gain from sales of united states real property interests are taxed to a non us shareholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a united states business 
non us shareholders would thus be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to us shareholders subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax 
also  distributions subject to firpta may be subject to a branch profits tax in the case of a foreign corporate shareholder not entitled to treaty exemption 
the company is required by treasury regulations to withhold of any distribution to a non us shareholder that could be designated by the company as a capital gains dividend 
this amount is creditable against the non us shareholder s firpta tax liability 
gain recognized by a non us shareholder upon a sale of shares generally will not be taxed under firpta if the company is a domestically controlled reit  defined generally as a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than in value of the reit s stock was held directly or indirectly by foreign persons 
the company believes that it is and will continue to be a domestically controlled reit  and therefore the sale of its shares has not been and will not be subject to taxation under firpta 
the company anticipates that sales of the company s shares by non us shareholders will not be subject to us taxation unless i the investment in the company s shares is effectively connected with the non us shareholder s trade or business in the united states  in which case such non us shareholder would be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to us shareholders subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax  or ii in the case of a non us shareholder who is a nonresident alien individual under section b of the code  such non us shareholder was present in the united states for a period or periods aggregating days or more during the taxable year  and certain other conditions apply  in which case such person would be subject to a tax on his capital gains 
other tax consequences the company and its shareholders may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions  including those in which it or they transact business or reside 
the state and local tax treatment of the company and its shareholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed above

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s historical and pro forma consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
such financial statements and information reflect the historical operations of the company through december the company has grown from a hotel chain with four inns  or rooms  at january   to inns  or  rooms  in operation at december  from its inception in until december   the company was engaged in the business of developing  owning and managing inns 
as part of its development activities  the company engaged in development and construction of new inns 
on december   the company reorganized by divesting itself of the subsidiary corporations through which it conducted its construction activities  securities brokerage activities and aviation operations 
in addition  the company transferred its outdoor advertising business to the predecessor to jameson outdoor advertising company  llc  which is wholly owned by the company s chairman and largest stockholder and his wife 
the company no longer manages or operates the inns upon their completion  but limits its activities to developing and owning the inns 
the operator leases the inns from the company and operates them 
the and pro forma financial information has eliminated those businesses which the company has not been engaged in since it divested itself of these businesses on december  so as to be comparable to the and historical financial information 
although in  and  room revenues were earned by the operator  not the company  they are the basis upon which the percentage rent paid to the company by the operator under the lease is determined and  accordingly  such revenues are discussed below 
the term same inn room revenues refers to revenues earned with respect to inns which were operating during both comparison periods and include revenues attributable to rooms added to existing inns by virtue of expansion of such inns 
effective january   the company s primary source of revenue became lease payments by the operator under the lease  and prior thereto under the predecessor leases with the partnerships which previously owned certain of the inns 
the expenses of the company consist of property taxes  insurance  corporate overhead  compensation expense or income related to certain stock options  interest on mortgage debt and depreciation of the inns 
the lease provides for the payment of base rent and percentage rent 
for the year ended december   base rent and percentage rent in the aggregate amount of million was earned by the company 
the principal determinant of percentage rent under the lease is room revenues of the inns 
therefore  management believes that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the operating inns  particularly with respect to occupancy  adr and revpar  is appropriate for understanding the lease revenue see funds from operations  cash available for distribution  below  for the calculation of adr and revpar 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  lease revenue for the company for increased to million as compared to million for the increase was due to the increase in the operator s room revenues  partially offset by the effect of a change in the percentage rent formula under the lease amendment effective july the number of room nights available increased from  in to  in  or  due to the opening from january through december of new room inns and six to room expansions of existing inns 
the occupancy rate decreased from for to for however  adr increased from in to in as a result of these three factors  room revenues rose  from million for to million in same inn room revenues for versus grew to million from million  or 
the growth is due to an increase in adr from to for these inns and an increase in room nights available due to expansions of certain of these inns from  to  partially offset by a decrease in the occupancy rate from to for these inns for compared to the decrease in overall occupancy of the inns is attributable primarily to i the expansion of several high occupancy inns which then experienced lower occupancy rates because of the additional rooms available in the marketplace  and ii the opening of new inns which typically require several months of operations before realizing higher occupancy rates

funds from operations  cash available for distribution the following table illustrates the company s calculation of funds from operations and cash available for distribution on an historical basis for the years ended december   and and on a pro forma basis for the year ended december  in march  the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit published a new interpretation of funds from operations which the company retroactively adopted at that time 
year ended december  historical pro forma historical in thousands net income     add depreciation expense     loss on disposals extraordinary item funds from operations  per march nareit interpretation     add stock compensation expense loan fee amortization expense less reserve for furniture  fixtures and equipment required loan principal repayments cash available for distribution     pro forma results assume i the company s initial public offering and all related transactions had occurred on january   and ii the company qualified as a reit  distributed all of its taxable income and  therefore  incurred no income tax expense during the pro forma period 
prior to july  the operator was responsible for the replacement and refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
after that date and in conjunction with the lease amendment  the company assumed this responsibility 
funds from operations is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit according to the march interpretation as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company has made adjustments to its net income loss consisting only of depreciation  loss on disposals and the extraordinary item for debt restructuring 
the company notes that industry analysts use funds from operations as another tool to evaluate and compare equity reits 
the company also believes it is meaningful as an indicator of net income excluding most non cash items 
other non cash expenses such as stock option expense have not been added back in funds from operations 
funds from operations does not represent cash flow from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all of the company s cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measure as an indicator of performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
cash available for distribution is calculated as funds from operations plus non cash stock option expense and loan fee amortization  less amounts estimated for future replacement and refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment and required loan principal repayments 
on july   the company adopted a policy of maintaining cash or sufficient access to borrowings equal to of the inns aggregate room revenues since july   less amounts actually spent from that date forward 
prior to this date  the obligation to fund replacement and refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment was the operator s 
for the period july  through december   of room revenues equalled  and the company expended  on such items in that same period 
in addition  the company expects to retain some portion of the cash available for distribution for working capital and capital expenditures 
liquidity and capital resources since its election to be taxed as a reit  the company has financed and currently intends to continue financing the construction of new inns entirely with bank borrowings 
at december   the company had approximately million in outstanding debt 
it is management s intention to continue to borrow from some or all of its previous lenders to finance future projects 
the company has a million line of credit the line convertible in june to a term note 
at december   the company had drawn down million under the line with million remaining available credit 
loans made under the line bear interest at rates initially ranging from to  which are adjustable annually to equal a major lender s prime rate as published in the wall street journal plus 
or 
percentage points 
the minimum annual interest rate payable under the line is and the maximum is 
the annual interest rates at december  ranged from to 
loans made under the line are secured by mortgages on of the inns 
payments of interest are due monthly  and monthly payments of principal commence in june principal on loans under the line is amortized using a year period and is payable in full in may construction and long term mortgage financing are expected to be available to fund the balance of construction costs not funded under the line 
for each new inn developed by the company  generally a construction loan for approximately million has been obtained 
each construction loan converts to a long term mortgage financing upon completion of the inn without any further action by the company 
each of the mortgage and construction loans outstanding at december   is amortized over years and is payable in full years from its inception 
the interest rate on each of such loans is adjusted annually  after an month interest only period  to the prime rate then prevailing plus 
to with a floor of and a cap of  with no annual change greater than 
the company believes it can continue to finance new inns with these construction and long term mortgage loans 
as of december   the company had five inns which were debt free and could be used as collateral should the company need additional borrowing capacity 
generally  inn expansions are also financed through construction loans 
management believes the company can adequately meet its financing needs for the next year through the traditional debt financing methods available to the company 
since the company presently intends to rely primarily on borrowings for construction and permanent financing of new inns and the expansion of existing inns  the lack of sufficient financing on favorable terms and conditions could prevent or significantly deter the company from constructing new inns or expanding existing inns 
the availability of such financing depends on a number of factors over which the company has no control  including general economic conditions  the economic and competitive environments of the communities in which the inns are located and the level and stability of long term interest rates 
the company also is considering possible additional long term debt or equity financing that would be available to fund its ongoing development activities 
in january  the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that provides for the issuance of an aggregate of up to million in common stock  preferred stock and common stock warrants to be offered and sold from time to time 
the company intends to use the net proceeds  if any  from any sale of securities under such registration statement for the repayment of existing indebtedness  working capital and general corporate purposes 
the company expects to continue to develop additional inns as suitable opportunities arise  and the company will not undertake investments unless adequate sources of financing are available 
as of december   the company had also borrowed approximately million to finance the construction of new inns at auburn and oxford  alabama  oakwood  georgia  forest city  laurinburg and wilson  north carolina  union  south carolina  decherd and tullahoma  tennessee 
in addition  the company is negotiating construction loans for the construction of new inns at tuscaloosa  alabama and sanford  north carolina 
total construction costs of these inns  excluding land and closing costs  is expected to be million when complete 
the company is also currently expanding the inn in gaffney  south carolina 
the expansion is being financed under the line 
the company may in the future expand additional inns if management determines that sufficient market demand exists and financing is available for any such expansion 
as with most real estate investments  the company s investments in the inns are relatively illiquid and such illiquidity is further increased by the inns location in small communities 
as a result  the ability of the company to sell or otherwise dispose of any inn to provide liquidity will be very limited 
in connection with its initial public offering in  the company sold to commonwealth associates  for an aggregate of  warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share exercisable at any time until january  the company has three stock incentive plans in place 
as of december    shares were reserved for future grants and  options were outstanding including  which were exercisable 
inflation operators of hotels in general possess the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
although the operator raised its room rates by approximately in july and april  competitive pressures have limited  and may in the future limit  the operator s ability to raise rates in the face of inflation 
seasonality the inns historical operations have been seasonal in nature  reflecting higher occupancy rates in the second and third quarters 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s lease revenue that it receives from the operator
