the enrollment at omnicare tn was approximately  at june   compared to approximately  at june   a decrease of  members or 
the state of tennessee s disenrollment of approximately  members in the quarter ending december was the primary reason for the decrease 
this action was taken by the state based upon the return of undeliverable questionnaires mailed to members  which the state requested for continued participation 
omnicare tn has contested the validity of this method of determining the continued eligibility of the medicaid recipients and has contacted approximately  of these disenrolled members to request that they contact the state to regain their eligibility  retroactive from the date of disenrollment 
the outcome of this effort is pending 
medical premiums for ultramedix increased million  from million in to million in the net increase is due to months of activity in compared to months in ultramedix s enrollment at june  was approximately  an increase of  from the june  enrollment of approximately  members 
ultramedix has made significant enrollment gains in the commercial market since approval of its hmo license in october the increase in the commercial market was due in part to the state of florida s unsuccessful initiative to mandate the enrollment of medicaid eligibles into managed care 
ultramedix was selected to participate in this program and the contract award would have capped ultramedix s medicaid enrollment  including existing members  at approximately  during the contract period 
because of legal challenges from unsuccessful bidders to the state s request for proposal  the initiative has been halted indefinitely 
to minimize the uncertainty related to rate reductions contemplated by the initiative  ultramedix has retargeted its marketing efforts to expand its commercial business 
this has contributed to the change in ultramedix s enrollment mix from medicaid to commercial as of june  to as of june as of september  the mix was 
the average per member per month pmpm premium rate in for omnicare tn was and for ultramedix based on current trends and historical contract adjustments by the respective state agencies  management expects a to rate increase for the existing omnicare tn medicaid members and to increase in the ultramedix medicaid rates 
management expects that the ultramedix pmpm also will be affected by the change in the membership mix  reflecting higher commercial rates 
management fees were million in  a decrease of million from fees of million in fiscal million of the decrease was due to the purchase of majority ownership interests in ultramedix and omnicare tn in january  resulting in the consolidation of these entities  including the elimination of inter company management fees 
million of the decrease was due to an agreement reached in june between the company and omnicare tn  pursuant to which omnicare tn agreed to reimburse the company approximately million for start up costs and other expenses incurred for the period january through september operating revenues of omnicare mi decreased in due primarily to a net decrease in enrollment rates of approximately  which resulted in decreased management fees to the company of approximately million 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in management fees from ppc  attributable primarily to increased ppc enrollment of approximately  offset by a decrease in premium rates of approximately and months of management fees in compared to months in the company s management agreement with ppc was terminated pursuant to binding arbitration  effective may   based in part on a dispute between the parties with respect to the payment of non emergent transportation costs for enrollees as a marketing expense to be incurred under the management agreement 
omnicare mi was notified in may that it had been selected to participate in the state of michigan s initiative to mandate medicaid enrollment into managed care organizations 
similar to the initiative in florida  the state s initiative was legally challenged by unsuccessful bidders responding to the state s request for proposal 
because of these legal challenges  the state did not assign the medicaid eligibles to plans that were awarded contracts in the bid process  but did  however  institute the rate reduction component of this new program effective july with the indefinite delay in the assignment of approximately  eligible recipients and the implementation of the rate reductions of to  the operating revenues of omnicare mi and the resulting management fees to the company are likely to be affected in there can be no assurances that omnicare mi can control health care costs at the rate of the premium reductions

excluding these non recurring adjustments  management believes that the mlr for omnicare tn could increase to over the next several quarters 
this increase could be offset by an anticipated enrollment increase as a result of the plan obtaining its commercial hmo license and expanding its service area 
the company also recently implemented a claims scanning system at omnicare tn 
management believes this new capability will greatly enhance the plan s ability to improve operating efficiencies related to claims processing 
management also expects a to decrease in the mlr for ultramedix as a result of an expected increase in the commercial membership base  renegotiation of provider contracts  new systems implementation and other corrective actions to improve utilization and case management practices 
some of these actions will also be instituted at omnicare tn

million recorded to reduce the company s million investment in healthscope

management believes that the continued operational improvements made by the new management of healthscope  the reduction of monthly operating cost  client growth and the announced rollout of the state of new york s mandatory medicaid initiative in early  are all critical factors in determining the ultimate recoverability of this investment 
the contract settlement expense recorded in december of million represented a one time adjustment to management fee revenues and its effect on other related accounts based on the provisions of the revised management agreement between ua tn and omnicare tn  as approved by the state of tennessee in november  retroactive to january despite the fact that omnicare tn agreed to reimburse the company approximately million in june for the start up and other costs incurred by the company between january and september  the transaction was not sufficiently documented to allow recognition of the same on the company s financial statements in december the estimated company expense related to the pending shareholder class action lawsuit settlement  net of insurance coverage  is million
