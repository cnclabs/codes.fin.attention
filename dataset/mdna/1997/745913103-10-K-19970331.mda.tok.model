the increase in sales outside the us helped margins on the sale of new systems rise from in to in in addition  the margin on the sale of system upgrades and enhancements and service increased from in to in this increase in margins for system upgrades  enhancements and service is reflective of a greater percentage of software upgrades  principally upgrades to the companys latest version of voice messaging software  infomail  performed in selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in as the company invested in upgrading its personnel and capabilities primarily in sales and marketing

as a result of the above  the company incurred a net loss of million as of december  compared to a net loss of million in the extent and timing of new orders for the companys existing products from vis providers has a substantial effect on the company s net sales 
such orders are usually significant in size and can materially affect sales in any quarter 
the company s operations are not subject to a particular seasonality  however  historically first quarter sales have been less than fourth quarter sales 
it is difficult to predict receipt of new orders reliably and quarterly revenues and operating results will depend on volume and timing of new orders received during a quarter

actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth below and elsewhere in this document 
digital sound operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
the voice processing and messaging industry is highly competitive  with rapid technological advances and constantly improving price performance 
as the markets in which the company operates continue to grow  the company is experiencing an increase in competition  and it expects this trend to continue 
the company is not one of the largest providers of voice processing and messaging equipment in the industry 
some of the company s competitors have substantially greater technical  marketing and financial resources and  in some markets  a larger installed base of customers and a wider range of available applications software 
the voice processing and messaging industry has experienced a continuing evolution of product offerings and alternatives for delivery of services 
these trends have affected and may be expected to have a significant continuing influence on conditions in the industry  although the impact on the industry generally and on the company s position in the industry cannot be predicted with assurance 
the company and the industry are  in general  dependent on the us domestic telephone companies for a large percentage of revenue 
the suppliers to the telephone company market  which is primarily comprised of regional bell operating companies and gte  have largely been decided for first generation voice processing requirements 
the market for voice processing and messaging systems is in a period of transition 
budgetary constraints  uncertainties resulting from the introduction of new technologies in the telecommunications environment and changes in the government regulations have increased uncertainties in the market 
significant changes in the domestic us industry as a result of the telecommunications act make planning decisions more difficult and increase the risk inherent in the planning process 
the company s operating results may fluctuate for a number of reasons 
the company has short delivery cycles and as a result does not have a large order backlog  which makes the forecasting of revenue inherently uncertain 
this uncertainty is compounded because each quarter s revenue results predominantly from orders booked and shipped during the third month of the quarter 
because the company plans its operating expenses  many of which are relatively fixed in the short term  on the basis of its anticipated revenues  even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a period s results to be substantially below expectations 
such a revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors  including lower than expected demand  supply constraints  delays in the availability of new products  overall economic conditions or natural disasters 
the international portion of the company s business  which represented of revenues for the year ending december   is subject to a number of inherent risks  including difficulties in building and managing international operations and international reseller networks and international service and support of the company s products  difficulties or delays in translating products into foreign languages  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  import export duties and quotas  and unexpected regulatory  economic or political changes in international markets 
although the majority of international transactions are performed through confirmed letters of credit  due to the competitive environment in the international marketplace  certain international customers may require longer payment terms  and as a result  days sales outstanding may periodically extend beyond ninety days on amounts due from these customers 
the development of new technologies and products is increasingly complex and uncertain  which increases the risk of delays 
the introduction of new systems requires close collaboration and continued technological advancement involving multiple hardware and software design  manufacturing  marketing and sales teams within the company as well as teams at outside suppliers of key components 
the failure of any one of these elements could cause the companys new products to fail to meet specifications or to miss the aggressive timetables that the company establishes 
as the variety and complexity of the company s product families increase  the process of planning production and inventory levels also becomes more difficult 
the company expects to continue investing heavily in supporting the development effort required to bring new technologies and products to the market 
to support this  substantial financial resources will be expended 
the company believes that its production capacity should be sufficient to support anticipated unit volumes for the foreseeable future 
the company is primarily engaged in the final assembly and testing of the hardware equipment 
the company currently buys the majority of its subassembly inventory from a limited number of suppliers 
the failure of these suppliers to provide such subassemblies on a timely basis and within specifications could have a materially adverse effect on the companys business 
if the company is unable to obtain certain key components  or to effectively forecast customer demand or manage its inventory  increased inventory obsolescence or reduced utilization of production capacity could adversely impact the company s gross margins and results of operations 
the company has historically derived a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from a relatively small number of customers 
in  the company derived of its revenue from a single customer 
international proposals for large system installations typically involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process  and the ability of the company to obtain a particular proposal award is inherently difficult to predict 
the company believes that the opportunities for these installations will continue to grow and intends to continue to expand its research and development  manufacturing  sales and marketing and product support capabilities in anticipation of such growth 
however  the timing and scope of these opportunities and the pricing and margins associated with any eventual proposal award are difficult to forecast  and may vary substantially from transaction to transaction 
the company s future operating results may  accordingly  exhibit a higher degree of volatility than the operating results of other companies in its industry that have adopted different strategies 
although the company is actively pursuing a number of opportunities both in and out of the united states  both the timing of any eventual opportunities and the probability of the company s receipts of significant purchase orders are uncertain 
the degree of dependence by the company on large orders  and the investment required to enable the company to perform such orders  without assurance of continuing order flow from the same customers and predictability of gross margins on any future orders  increase the risk associated with its business 
the company s stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility 
if revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate impact on the company s stock price 
the stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to the company s performance 
the company routinely receives communications from third parties asserting patent or other rights covering the company s products and technologies 
based upon the companys evaluation  it may take no action or it may seek to obtain a license 
in any given case there is a risk that a license will not be available with terms that the company considers reasonable  or that litigation will ensue 
the company expects that  as the number of hardware and software patents issued continues to increase  and as the company s business grows  the volume of these third party communications will also increase 
the company s corporate headquarters facility  at which the majority of its research and development activities are conducted  is located near major earthquake faults which have experienced earthquakes in the past 
while the company does carry insurance at levels management believes to be prudent  in the event of a major earthquake or other disaster affecting one or more of the company s facilities  it is likely that insurance proceeds would not cover all of the costs incurred and  therefore  the operations and operating results of the company could be adversely affected 
due to the factors noted above and elsewhere in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company s future earnings and common stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from the levels anticipated by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in a fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
furthermore  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry which often results in volatility of the company s common stock price 
finally the company has not been operating profitably 
the company s strategy has been to develop new technology and to expand its marketing capabilities  with the goal of creating successful new products and marketing them effectively  thereby returning the company to profitability 
the company s on going investments in technology and marketing require funds  and although the company presently has a healthy cash balance  the company s financial resources are not unlimited  and the company s funds eventually will be exhausted if the company s strategy does not succeed in returning the company to profitability or otherwise enable it to raise additional working capital 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   working capital decreased by million to million compared to million at december  in the decrease in working capital resulted principally from a reduction in cash of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in inventory of million and an increase in accounts payable of million and an increase in accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities of million 
the decrease in cash reflects the company s strategy of continued investment in new product development  product enhancements and strengthening of its marketing and sales capabilities 
at december   the company had cash of million and no long term debt 
during  net cash used by operations was million  which was offset by million of interest earned on cash balances 
interest and other income decreased from million in to million in  principally the result of a lower average cash balance 
the capital expenditures were million  while budgeted expenditures for are million  principally hardware and software for test equipment 
the company is currently negotiating to obtain tax advantage lease arrangements with banks for the purpose of capital acquisitions for the company believes that current cash balances and cash flow from operations along with the sale leaseback arrangements will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements at least through the company has never paid any cash dividends on its stock and anticipates that  for the foreseeable future  it will continue to retain any earnings for use in the operation of its business 
for the year ended december   working capital decreased by million to million compared to million at december  in the reduction in working capital resulted principally from a decrease in accounts receivable of million caused by substantially lower sales  a reclassification of million to other assets as a result of long term investments which exceed the company s definition of cash and equivalents  a settlement of million as described in note of notes to financial statements in the annual report  and a decrease in other accrued liabilities related to sales tax payable and accrued license fees totaling million 
at december   the company had cash of million and no long term debt 
during  net cash used by operations was million  which was offset by million of interest earned on cash balances 
for the year ended december   working capital increased by million to million compared to million at december  the net change in working capital resulted principally from net proceeds from the preferred stock issuance and a substantial decrease in accounts payable 
at december   the company had cash of million and no debt 
during  net cash provided by operations was million  which included million of interest earned on cash balances
