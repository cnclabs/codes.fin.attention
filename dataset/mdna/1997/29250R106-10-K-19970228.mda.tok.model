item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in october  the ferc approved the settlement agreement between the partnership and customer representatives on all outstanding contested tariff rates 
the agreement provided for a tariff rate reduction of approximately and total rate refunds and interest of million through the effective date of october  refunds of million were made in the fourth quarter of  with the remaining balance million at december  to be paid through a reduction on future rates 
this reduction will continue until all refunds have been made  which is expected to take approximately three years 
interest will continue to accrue on the unpaid balance 
the settlement agreement also provides that the agreed tariff rates will be subject to indexing as prescribed by ferc regulations and that the partnership s customer representatives will not challenge any rates within the indexed ceiling for a period of five years 
on october   the board of directors of the general partner increased the quarterly cash distribution to per unit per unit on an annualized basis from per unit 
this increase  the second since the partnership s inception  is the result of continued earnings growth and the removal of the uncertainty relating to the partnership s tariff rates 
results of operations the partnership continued its strong operational performance in as deliveries averaged a record  barrels per day  up from the  barrels averaged in system utilization  measured in barrel miles  remained relatively unchanged from last year  reflecting a higher proportion of shorter haul deliveries to the significant midwest markets served by the partnership 
deliveries and barrel miles during were up and  respectively  over as a result of the partnership s expansion 
net income for was million per unit compared with million per unit in and million per unit in net income is impacted in all years by the rate refunds and related interest recorded in response to various tariff rate regulatory developments 
in order to eliminate the retroactive aspects of these developments and to facilitate comparison  operating results have been recalculated as shown below 
this information includes the impact of the settlement agreement on the years presented and excludes any amounts related to prior years 
recalculated operating results dollars in millions  except per unit amounts operating revenue operating expenses interest income interest expense minority interest net income net income per unit recalculated net income for was million  or per unit  higher than in a combination of higher operating revenue  lower total operating expenses and greater interest income  partially offset by higher interest expense  led to the increase 
recalculated net income for reflects the positive impact of the partnership s expansion program and was million  or per unit  greater than this expansion resulted in higher operating revenue which was partially offset by increased operating and interest expense 
recalculated operating revenue is computed at the tariff rates implied in the settlement agreement 
these implied rates include an approximate increase on november   allowed to reflect the additional costs associated with the expansion  and an approximate increase on july  allowed under the ferc s indexing methodology 
operating revenue for was million higher than primarily due to a greater proportion of heavy crude oil deliveries up to  barrels per day and the tariff rate increase 
the tariff rate for heavier crude oil is greater than that for lighter crude oils primarily due to its higher viscosity which requires more power to pump 
the partnership s current tariff rate for heavy crude oil deliveries to the chicago area is approximately to higher than that for lighter crude oils 
operating revenue for was above the previous year s recalculated amount of million 
this increase was due to both the transportation of greater volumes and the november tariff rate increase 
total recalculated operating expenses were million less than in primarily due to lower power costs million and oil losses million 
efficiencies gained from the partnership s ongoing power cost management initiative  partially offset by the transportation of greater amounts of heavy crude oil  led to the decrease in power costs 
oil losses are impacted by operational considerations  including changing customer delivery requirements  and the volatility of crude oil prices  resulting in variances in the level of oil losses from year to year 
despite growth in property  plant and equipment  depreciation expense increased only slightly over due to the impact of new depreciation rates  effective july   which better represent the service life of the pipeline system 
this change in depreciation rates  approved by the ferc  resulted in depreciation expense being approximately million lower than it would have been utilizing the prior rates 
total recalculated operating expenses were million greater than in primarily due to a combination of additional ongoing costs resulting from the expansion program depreciation and property taxes million and lower overhead costs capitalized million  partially offset by lower oil losses million and maintenance costs million 
overhead costs capitalized were more in as a higher proportion of employee time was spent on capital projects as opposed to maintenance and repair projects due to the capacity expansion 
efficiencies implemented with the expansion  as well as management initiatives  contributed to oil losses being less than in a reduction in periodic pipeline inspection costs led to lower maintenance costs in interest income in increased over due to higher average investment balances 
interest income in was greater than in due to both higher average interest rates and investment balances 
recalculated interest expense for was million greater than in primarily due to the impact of additional borrowings under the partnership s credit facility to finance enhancement capital expenditures 
recalculated interest expense increased million over the previous year primarily due to the impact of higher average balances and interest rates with respect to accrued rate refunds million and borrowings under the credit facility million 
in addition  interest capitalized in was million lower than in larger capital projects  primarily the expansion program  allowed more interest to be capitalized in liquidity and capital resources at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  up million since december   as cash generated from operating activities and borrowings exceeded cash required for distributions  capital expenditures and rate refunds 
of this million  million per unit was set aside for the cash distribution paid on february   with the remaining million available for capital expenditures  distributions or other business needs 
cash generated from operating activities in decreased million from primarily due to the repayment of rate refunds and related interest  partially offset by higher net income 
cash generated from operating activities in was million over as higher cash flow from income before non cash deductions for depreciation and accrued rate refunds was partially offset by greater working capital requirements 
timing differences in the collection of accounts receivable and payment of accrued obligations led to the year to year changes in working capital requirements 
in  the partnership made capital expenditures of million  of which million was for the expansion program 
the expansion consisted primarily of several new pump stations on line from superior to chicago and a new tank at clearbrook  and increased delivery capacity into chicago area markets by up to  barrels per day 
approximately  barrels per day of this added capacity will be required to offset the effects of moving increased volumes of heavy crude oil  which can lower system delivery capability 
of the remaining capital expenditures  million million  million was spent for core maintenance capital expenditures and million million  million for other enhancements 
distributions paid to partners increased million to million per unit in the per unit quarterly distribution increase first paid in november accounted for the increase 
distributions increased million over to million per unit 
the full year effect of distributions paid on the additional million preference units issued in september primarily accounted for this increase 
in february  the partnership paid a per unit distribution related to the fourth quarter of this was the last distribution subject to certain preferential rights of the preference unitholders and certain support obligations of the general partner 
with respect to subsequent cash distributions  the preference and common units will be treated as one class of units 
for additional details  please read note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements 
the partnership borrowed million under its million revolving credit facility in  primarily to finance the expansion in accordance with an appropriate regulatory capital structure 
this brings total borrowings under the facility to million at december  for additional details relating to the revolving credit facility  please read note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements 
the general partner believes that the partnership will continue to have adequate liquidity to fund future recurring operating  investing and financing activities 
cash distributions and certain recurring capital expenditure programs are expected to be funded with internally generated cash 
significant enhancement capital expenditures are expected to be funded with internally generated cash  borrowings or the proceeds from additional equity offerings 
future prospects income and cash flows are sensitive to oil industry supply and demand in both canada and the united states  as well as the regulatory environment 
as the lakehead system is operationally integrated with the ipl system  the partnership s revenues are dependent upon the utilization of the ipl system by producers of western canadian crude oil 
interprovincial and the general partner believe demand for the system will continue in light of industry s increasing production forecasts for western canadian crude oil 
the partnership intends to maintain and enhance the service capability of the lakehead system 
this will require future capital expenditures which are estimated to be up to million on a recurring annual basis 
in addition  in response to the increased midwest us demand for cost effective and timely access to western canadian production  the partnership and interprovincial have begun working on an additional expansion which is expected to increase delivery capacity to this important market by approximately  barrels per day 
on the lakehead system  this expansion will consist primarily of a new mile inch pipeline from superior to chicago at an approximate cost of million 
right of way and environmental permitting work began in and will continue in the general partner believes that the majority of the expenditures for pipeline construction will be incurred in  with completion planned for the second half of that same year 
the partnership plans on financing this expansion with existing cash balances  borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of additional partnership units 
the partnership s expansion is not expected to significantly impact net income at this time 
however  the general partner believes that it adds the long term flexibility necessary to meet emerging supply and transportation trends in north america and complements the partnership s future new pipeline from superior to chicago 
the general partner believes that these combined expansions will position the partnership to realize increased cash flows which will enhance the partnership s future distribution capability 
the partnership finalized an agreement with mustang pipe line partners in october to provide for a future joint tariff covering shipments of western canadian crude oil to the patoka  illinois market area south of chicago 
these shipments will travel on the partnership s system to chicago  and on to patoka through the mustang pipeline system 
the joint tariff agreement will provide for lower transportation costs to shippers desiring access to the patoka market  an incentive which the general partner believes complements the partnership s future new pipeline from superior to chicago 
mustang pipe line partners is a delaware general partnership owned by mobil illinois pipe line company and a wholly owned subsidiary of ipl energy usa 
bp exploration oil inc has announced a proposal to convert  barrels per day of light crude oil processing capacity to medium heavy crude oil capacity at its toledo  ohio refinery 
in conjunction with this  ipl energy has proposed construction of a mile inch pipeline which would connect the partnership s system near stockbridge  michigan to bp s toledo refinery 
the general partner believes these proposals also complement the future line from superior to chicago as they offer another market for western canadian producers of medium and heavy crude oil 
various approvals and agreements are required before these proposals can proceed 
the partnership and interprovincial are committed to remaining the primary transporter of western canadian crude oil to the us midwest and eastern canada 
as such  and in light of potential further demand for capacity  the partnership and interprovincial have entered into preliminary discussions with shippers to provide for additional expansions beyond the new pipeline from superior to chicago 
the partnership is subject to a rate regulatory methodology which prescribes rate ceilings adjusted every july the rate ceilings are adjusted by reference to annual changes in the producer price index for finished goods minus one percent ppifg 
the general partner does not anticipate that ppifg will change significantly enough july  to have a material effect on operating revenue 
the general partner also believes that the impact of inflation on the partnership s overall operating expenses will be mitigated by ongoing cost control initiatives 
the settlement agreement will benefit the partnership by restoring stability and providing predictable tariff rates as customer representatives have agreed not to challenge any rates within the indexed ceiling for a period of five years 
in addition  the partnership and customer representatives agreed to the terms of an incremental tariff rate surcharge to recover the cost of  and allow a rate of return on  the new line from superior to chicago 
the rate of return on this new line will be based on the utilization level of the additional capacity constructed 
the partnership is also subject to the risks of environmental costs and liabilities inherent in pipeline operations 
to the extent that the partnership is unable to recover environmental costs in its rates or through insurance  the general partner has agreed to indemnify the partnership from and against any costs relating to environmental liabilities associated with the lakehead system prior to its transfer to the partnership in this indemnity excludes any liabilities resulting from a change in laws after such transfer
