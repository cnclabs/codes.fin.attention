item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed below  elsewhere herein and in the caption risk factors in the company s registration statement on form s filed on september  overview learning tree international  inc the company  is a leading worldwide provider of education and training for information technology it professionals in business and government organizations 
the company s customers are the companies and government agencies which pay for their employees to attend the company s course events 
the company develops  markets and delivers a broad  proprietary library of instructor led course titles which are focused on client server systems  intranet internet technologies  computer networks  operating systems  databases  programming languages  graphical user interfaces  object oriented technology and it management 
the company also tests and certifies it professionals in it job functions 
the company s courses are recommended for college credit by the american council on education 
during  the company expanded the breadth of its instructor led training activities through the introduction of its learning solutions division 
the new learning solutions division provides custom developed training programs for larger clients who need to train large numbers of their it professionals and end users 
the initial focus of this new division is on training that supports the roll out and use of new organization wide information systems  tools and applications 
in  the company also introduced a program of power seminars  which were multi day conferences comprised of a number of day  multimedia lecture style seminars in key information technologies 
in november  the company announced that it was no longer going to offer its power seminars 
in addition to its instructor led courses  the company is continuing to expand its line of interactive computer based training courses incorporating audio and graphical elements cbt that are designed for both stand alone cd rom and network based delivery 
the company has historically focused on instructor led it training in multi vendor  multi platform computer systems open systems emphasizing computer technologies such as internetworking  operating systems and advanced programming languages 
until the early s  these technologies were used almost exclusively by it professionals involved in research  development and engineering 
beginning in the early s and accelerating through the present  management information systems mis departments began shifting from legacy mainframe systems to new client server technologies  thus expanding the market for training of mis personnel in areas covered by the company s courses 
these technologies have contributed significantly to the increased use of computer systems by businesses and government organizations 
beginning in fiscal  in order to increase its market share  the company introduced a new marketing initiative by creating multiple enrollment programs  such as its training passport  college credit and professional certification programs  which give participants an incentive to enroll in a series of learning tree course events 
see business marketing and sales 
additionally at that time and continuing through the present  the company has increased both its sales and marketing expenditures and its course development expenditures 
through its increased investment in course development  the company has expanded its curriculum of course titles in client server technology  networks and databases covering additional topics relevant to the training market for mis professionals 
in management s view  these new course titles provided an expanded role for the company in the it training market by attracting mis participants both to its new and existing course titles 
the company s revenues grew to record levels in fiscal  increasing by over fiscal in response to the growth in course participants  the company has and plans to continue its accelerated rate of development of new course titles  has expanded its future direct mailing plans to capture additional market share and has taken steps to expand the number of classrooms in its education centers 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve an increase in market share after making such expenditures or will maintain its growth in revenues  profitability or market share in the future 
the company s revenues and profitability are subject to general economic conditions and a significant portion of the company s revenues are derived from fortune level companies and their international equivalents 
such companies have historically adjusted their expenditures for external it training during economic downturns 
should the economy weaken in any future period  these companies may not increase or may reduce their expenditures on external it training  which would have an adverse impact on the company 
the company s instructor led course events are taught in classrooms and include extensive  hands on exercises under the guidance of expert instructors 
the company has structured its business so that the majority of its instructor led course costs depend upon the number of course events it conducts 
the company schedules its multi day course events throughout the year as appropriate to meet demand 
since the company s instructors typically work full time in the it industry and teach an average of eight to nine learning tree course events each year  as needed  the company s instructor related costs are largely variable 
in addition  although the expenses associated with its own education centers are fixed  the company can impact its overall facility expenses by varying its use of rented hotel and conference facilities 
because the cost for each course event does not increase significantly as additional participants are included  the company utilizes a variety of techniques to maximize the number of participants per course event  up to limits designed to preserve the quality of each course event 
these techniques include adding additional events for a popular course title  combining two or more undersubscribed events into one course event and adding an assistant instructor to increase the maximum number of students that can be effectively taught in a course event 
the extent to which these techniques are used is subject to a number of factors within a particular market segment 
backlog at september   the company had a backlog of orders for courses in the amount of million  which represented a increase over the backlog of million at september  only a portion of the company s backlog is funded 
there can be no assurance that the growth in the backlog experienced in fiscal over fiscal will continue or that orders comprising the backlog will be realized as revenue 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenues year ended september  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses course development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared with fiscal for the fiscal year ended september   revenues increased by million or to million from million for the fiscal year ended september  the growth of revenues is due  in part  to an increase in the number of multi day course participants to  compared to  in the corresponding prior year 
the additional course participants are primarily attributable to increased sales and marketing activities and an increase in the number of multi day course titles 
the number of multi day course titles increased to as of september   compared to a year earlier 
revenues for fiscal also reflect a increase in average revenue per multi day course participant 
the increase in the average revenues per course participant is attributable to an increase in the average course duration and increases in prices 
the increase in revenues also reflects increased revenues from the multimedia cbt product line as well as revenues from the company s new learning solutions division and  to a lesser extent  from its power seminars 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are denominated in foreign currencies which have been translated into dollars based upon the exchange rates prevailing when the revenues were earned 
exchange rate changes during the year reduced revenues by approximately  in fiscal compared to the exchange rates prevailing during fiscal the company s cost of revenues primarily includes the costs associated with the course instructor  course materials and equipment  freight  classroom facilities and refreshments 
for the fiscal year ended september   the cost of revenues increased million or to million from million for the previous fiscal year 
the increase in the cost of revenues is primarily the result of the increased number of course events as well as costs associated with the increased sales in the multimedia cbt product line  the costs of delivering learning solutions courses and power seminars 
the number of multi day course events increased in fiscal to  from  course events in fiscal costs per multi day course event increased by approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal the change in the average cost per course event primarily reflects a increase in the average course duration  the higher costs of conducting more course events at sites other than education centers due to education center capacity constraints and the cost of training new instructors 
to accommodate the growth in course enrollments  the company added additional education center facilities during fiscal and is seeking additional education center facilities in certain locations 
the cost of revenues increased to percent of revenues in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal  largely because of lower gross margins in the power seminars and learning solutions product lines compared with the company s traditional multi day instructor led courses and multimedia cbt courses  and also because of the increased cost per multi day instructor led course event as described above 
course development expense includes the costs of developing new course titles and updating the company s existing course library 
the principal costs are for internal product development staff and independent consultants who serve as subject matter experts 
for the fiscal year ended september   course development expenses increased by million or to million from million for fiscal this increase reflects the costs associated with the company s strategy of rapidly expanding its multimedia cbt and multi day instructor led course libraries to meet its customers growing technology training needs  updating and maintaining the growing course title libraries  and developing courses for learning solutions and power seminars 
the number of multi day course titles increased to as of september   compared to a year earlier 
the number of multimedia cbt course titles increased to as of september  compared to a year ago 
the company plans to continue its strategy of rapidly growing both its instructor led course library and its multimedia cbt library  including additional titles in the areas of intranet internet technologies  computer networking  java  windows nt  programming languages and databases 
as a result  the amount of course development expenses are expected to continue to increase in fiscal the actual number of instructor led and multimedia cbt course titles which the company will produce and their delivery dates are subject to a number of factors such as the hiring and training of additional staff  continued refinements in the cbt development and production process and the availability of subject matter experts who are also responsible for teaching the company s instructor led courses 
sales and marketing expense consists of salaries  commissions and travel related costs for sales and marketing personnel  the costs of designing  producing and distributing direct mail marketing and media advertisements  and the costs of information systems to support these activities 
sales and marketing expenses increased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses is due to an increase in direct mail marketing to a broader range of potential multi day instructor led customers and to potential power seminar customers  increased telemarketing to support the multi day instructor led courses and power seminars and increased field sales staff for multi day instructor led courses and multimedia cbt 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal increased as a percentage of revenues to compared to in fiscal in fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million from million for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses reflects increases in information systems and other administrative staff and facilities which were necessary to support the growth in revenues 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses declined to from in the prior year 
other income expense is primarily comprised of interest income  interest expense and foreign currency gains and losses 
for fiscal  other income increased million to million from million for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to additional interest income arising from higher average cash balances during the year 
in fiscal  the company recorded foreign exchange losses of  compared to  of foreign exchange losses in fiscal these transaction gains and losses arose from receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
although the company s consolidated financial statements are stated in us dollars  several of the company s subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
gains and losses arising from the translation of the balance sheets of the company s subsidiaries from the functional currencies to us dollars are reported as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
however  fluctuations in exchange rates may have an effect on the company s results of operations  particularly its revenues and operating income  when translating the income statements to dollars 
the impact of future exchange rates on the company s results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to date  the company has not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and therefore continues to be subject to such risks 
in the future  the company may undertake such transactions 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques implemented by the company would be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
for fiscal  the provision for income taxes increased by million to million from million for fiscal this increase  in part  reflects an increase in income before taxes in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  in fiscal  certain of the company s subsidiaries utilized tax loss carryforwards to offset a portion of their taxable income for the year whereas there were no loss carryforwards available in fiscal learning tree international  inc operates as a holding company with operating subsidiaries in several countries  and each subsidiary is taxed based on the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates 
since taxes are incurred at the subsidiary level  and one subsidiary s tax losses cannot offset the taxable income of subsidiaries in other tax jurisdictions  the company s consolidated effective tax rate may vary 
accordingly  the company s consolidated effective tax rate may increase in the future 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal were greatest in the company s largest geographic segments  the united states and europe 
all of the company s geographic segments were profitable in fiscal the european segment recording operating income of million in fiscal compared to operating income of million in fiscal as a result of revenue increases primarily in the united kingdom and sweden 
the operating income of the united states segment  which includes the results of the corporate headquarters  declined by million to a break even level 
this reflects losses incurred in the company s power seminars activity as well as increased corporate costs

fiscal compared with fiscal for the fiscal year ended september   revenues increased by million or to million from million for the fiscal year ended september  the growth of revenues is due  in part  to an increase in the number of course participants to  compared to  in the corresponding prior year 
the additional course participants are primarily attributable to increased direct mail marketing and an increase in the number of course titles to as of september   compared to a year earlier 
in addition  the growth in the number of course participants is attributable to the expansion of the number of learning tree site course events which the company held at sites other than its education centers in order to broaden its customer base 
revenues for fiscal also reflect higher average revenues per course participant 
the increase in the average revenues per course participant is attributable to the increase in the proportion of higher paying single course event participants over those attending under the discounted passport program  increased revenue per passport attendee and increased prices for customer site course events 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are denominated in foreign currencies which have been translated into dollars based upon the exchange rates prevailing when the revenues were earned

the company s course development and sales and marketing expenses are incurred based on its expectations regarding future market conditions and there can be no assurance that the attendant revenues will occur 
specifically  the company intends to increase the amount of its expenditures for course development and sales and marketing in the future 
the company may be unable to adjust its expenditures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
any significant revenue shortfall would therefore have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company s operating results may fluctuate based on other factors including the frequency and availability of course events  the number of weeks in a quarter during which courses can be conducted  the frequency  size of and response to the company s direct mail marketing campaigns  the timing of the introduction of new course titles and alternate delivery methods  the mix between customer site course events and learning tree site course events  competitive forces within the current and anticipated future markets served by the company  the spending patterns of its customers  currency fluctuations  inclement weather  and general economic conditions 
fluctuations in quarter to quarter results may also occur depending on differences in the timing of  and the time period between  the company s expenditures on the development and marketing of its courses and the receipt of revenues 
the company s revenues and income have also varied significantly from quarter to quarter due to seasonal factors 
the company generally has greater revenue and operating income in the second half of its fiscal year april through september than in the first half of its fiscal year 
this seasonality is due in part to seasonal spending patterns of the company s customers  and in part to quarterly differences in the frequency and size of the company s direct mail marketing campaigns  as well as weather  holiday and vacation patterns 
there can be no assurance that these seasonal effects will remain the same in the future 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased to million at september  from million at september  in addition  the company had million of short term interest bearing investments at september  compared to million at september  the change in the combined total of cash  cash equivalents and short term interest bearing investments in fiscal primarily reflects the cash provided by operations and cash used for additions to equipment  property and leasehold improvements 
for fiscal  cash provided by operations was approximately million compared to million during fiscal the increase in cash provided by operations reflects the increase in profitability and increases in deferred revenues arising from prepaid multi enrollment programs 
at september   the company had working capital of million 
during fiscal  the company invested million in equipment  property and leasehold improvements compared to million in fiscal this increase is primarily related to additional course equipment to support the growth in the number of course events and to upgrade course equipment capabilities  the build out of new education center and office facilities and the purchase of office computer equipment 
although the company expects to continue to invest in additional equipment and facilities in fiscal  as of september   the company had no material future purchase obligations  capital commitments or debt 
accordingly  management believes that its cash  cash equivalents and short term interest bearing investments together with the cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements at least until the end of fiscal it is contemplated that part of the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term interest bearing investments may be used for acquisitions 
while the company has no current agreements in place or negotiations underway with respect to any acquisition  the company plans to regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities that fit within its business plan 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including potential difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  diversion of management s attention away from normal operating activities  negative financial impacts based on the amortization of acquired intangible assets  the dilutive effects of the issuance of common stock in connection with an acquisition  and potential loss of key employees of the acquired operation 
the company has had no experience in executing and implementing acquisitions and no assurance can be given as to the success of the company in executing and implementing acquisitions in the future 
the company has not paid any cash dividends since its inception and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future
