item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations since its inception in  the company has been engaged in the design  development  and medical evaluation of digital holography  a sophisticated system that yields film based  hard copy images of the internal structure of the human body 
the digital holography system consists of the voxcam imager  a camera to convert computed tomography and magnetic resonance scans into holograms  voxbox light boxes to view the holograms  and voxgram film on which the hologram is recorded 
the company has not yet developed products for sale  has not earned revenues  and has incurred substantial losses since inception 
the company expects to continue to incur substantial operating losses for at least twelve months from the date of this report  as research  development  manufacturing  and marketing activities expand 
in previous filings  the company indicated that certain prerequisites needed to be fulfilled prior to initial commercial sales of the digital holography system 
one of these prerequisites was accomplished on september   when the company received k clearance from the fda to sell the digital holography system 
the remaining prerequisites to initial commercial sales include development and testing of pre production prototypes  manufacturing of production units  and achieving market acceptance for the digital holography system 
there can be no assurance that  on a timely basis or at all  any or all of the remaining prerequisites will be satisfied 
the company currently anticipates that initial production units of the digital holography system will be available for commercial sale no earlier than the first quarter of this represents an extension of previously discussed schedules for commercialization 
completion of the engineering and assembly of pre production prototypes and commercial units of the voxcam  heretofore the responsibility of gsi  has been delayed 
see business manufacturing 
this delay has increased the company s requirements for capital 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations years ended december  and net loss for increased by to million from million in the company had no revenues during or research and development r d expense increased by to million from million 
this increase resulted from i enhanced in house support of gsi s product development and manufacturing activities  including increased technical headcount and travel  ii costs of preparing for beta site installations  and iii initiation of beta voxbox production 
total payments to design engineering firms with respect to the voxcam development program  which represent over half of r d expense in both and  increased modestly 
however  the majority of such payments in represented reimbursement for beta unit parts while such payments in were primarily for engineering services 
general and administrative g a expense which includes marketing activities increased by to million from million 
this increase resulted from the growth of the sales organization and increased marketing effort  administrative costs were virtually unchanged 
in  the company s primary marketing focus shifted from promoting clinical activities to developing customer relationships 
sales headcount and travel increased correspondingly 
depreciation and amortization expense was essentially unchanged 
net interest income for was  compared to  in this difference is due to higher average investment balances as a consequence of the company s secondary public offering the secondary in august years ended december  and net loss for increased by to million from million in r d expense increased by to million from million 
this increase was primarily attributable to costs of design engineering services for the development of the pre production prototypes of the voxcam and voxbox 
g a expense which includes marketing activities increased by to million from million 
this increase resulted primarily from an intensified focus on marketing 
the company augmented its trade show presence  clinical exhibit support  and market research activities 
also contributing to the g a increase were modestly increased costs of administrative support for the growing organization eg rent  insurance  and office activities 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased to  in from  in because of a one time option related amortization charge recognized in net interest income for was  compared to net interest expense of  in the difference resulted from interest income on ipo proceeds that were invested in short term securities 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations primarily through private and public sales of equity securities and the private placement of debt securities and  to a far lesser extent  through equipment lease financing 
as of december  the company had raised million net of underwriting commissions and offering expenses from the secondary  million net of underwriting commissions and offering expenses from the ipo  million from the sale of convertible redeemable preferred stock  million net of underwriting commissions and expenses from the sale of convertible preferred stock  and million from the sale of debt securities 
the convertible redeemable preferred stock and million of the debt together with accrued interest thereon were converted to common stock at the closing of the ipo on november  the remaining million of the debt securities together with accrued interest thereon was repaid from the proceeds of the ipo on november  the convertible preferred stock was converted to common stock during the company had a capital lease obligation of  as of december  the company s net cash used in operating activities during the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the increases in cash used in operations were due primarily to increased research and development  medical evaluation activity  and marketing 
as of december   the company had cash and short term investments totaling million 
this compares with cash and short term investments totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash and short term investments from to is the result of the receipt of funds from the secondary 
the decrease in cash at year end was due to the use of cash for operating activities  partially offset by the receipt of million net of underwriting commissions and expenses of proceeds from the placement of convertible preferred stock 
as of december   the company had working capital of million as compared to working capital of million and million at december  and  respectively 
working capital at december  consists primarily of the net proceeds received from the secondary 
working capital at december  is primarily the result of the net proceeds received from the sale of convertible preferred stock 
the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
however  the company expects to incur substantial expense to remedy the shortcomings of the gsi designed voxcam  conduct field tests of pre production units of the voxcam  complete the manufacturing engineering of the commercial voxcam  and commence its production 
the company believes that available cash will be sufficient to meet the company s operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the duration of calendar year however  the company will require additional funding on one or more occasions in order to achieve its operating objectives 
the delays in the completion of engineering of the commercial voxcam  field testing of beta units  and manufacturing of initial production units have increased the company s requirements for capital 
the amount and timing of the company s future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including progress of the voxcam engineering activities  the success and duration of beta unit field testing  the timing of the transition from beta to commercial unit production  and the extent and timing of acceptance of the digital holography system 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms  or at all  when required by the company
