effective july   the company s fiscal year was changed to end on the monday closest to march to coincide with the fiscal year of its parent  fujitsu 
as used in this annual report  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal refer to the company s fiscal years ended april   april   and march   respectively 
the company s operating results for fiscal are included in fujitsu s consolidated financial statements for fujitsu s fiscal under japanese convention  the fiscal year is denominated by the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences  under united states convention it is denominated by the calendar year in which the fiscal year ends 
thus the company s fiscal and fujitsu s fiscal both refer to the year ended march  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for an explanation of the computation of net income loss per common share 
the predecessor company s net income loss per common share for the periods ended prior to the fujitsu acquisition is not comparable to subsequent periods due to the different capitalization of the predecessor company and  therefore  has not been presented

interest income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss general overview in the company recorded a million charge against cost of goods sold relating to a reduction in the value of its microprocessor related and other inventory  primarily due to obsolescence 
in addition sales of the company s products in aggregate declined from approximately million in the first quarter of the year to approximately million in the fourth quarter of the year 
the reduction in sales was primarily attributable to a reduction in orders from the company s primary customer and to changes in executive and sales personnel  which diminished the company s ability to both sell its products and monitor credit and collections 
the company s inability to monitor credit and collections resulted in a charge of million for accounts receivable write offs 
the reduction in the level of sales resulted in an increase in the manufacturing overhead associated with parts assembled by the company  reducing the company s gross profit margin 
the aggregate losses incurred by the company were funded by bank loans guaranteed by fujitsu 
as a result of the losses and the deterioration of the company s financial condition and liquidity  remaining goodwill of approximately million was written off and a valuation reserve of approximately million was established against the company s deferred tax asset 
during the third quarter  the company s chief financial officer resigned  and during the fourth quarter  the company s chairman  president  chief executive officer and founder resigned 
subsequent to year end the company hired a president and chief executive officer  a chief financial officer  and a vice president of sales 
subsequent to year end  the company received assurances from fujitsu that in accordance with our plan for ross technology  we fujitsu are ready to provide the necessary trading through debt guarantees or other types of financing for ross technology not to incur cash flow shortages through april  net sales 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which increased from million in fiscal the decrease in net sales from to is primarily attributable to a decrease in sales to oem microprocessor chip customers reflecting the lack of a major design win for its leading edge colorado microprocessor products  turnover in sales and executive management  and to a lack of new products to match sun s introduction of bit products 
the increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from increases in unit volumes of the company s mhz and mhz hypersparc products and introduction and increasing sales of the company s mhz kilobyte cache and mhz one megabyte cache products to oem customers 
in addition  the company s ability to ship product was significantly enhanced throughout fiscal as a result of improved manufacturing yields over fiscal in the company entered the systems market for workstations and servers in addition to its traditional business of providing microprocessor components 
sales of such systems were below the company s expectations 
during fiscal  of the company s net sales were derived from oem customers with sun  fujitsu and other oems accounting for   and  respectively  of total net sales 
during fiscal  of the company s net sales were derived from oem customers with sun  fujitsu and other oems accounting for  and  respectively  of total net sales and from upgrade customers 
during fiscal  by comparison  of net sales were derived from oem customers with sun  fujitsu and other oems accounting for  and  respectively  of total net sales and from upgrade customers 
the change in oem sales mix for fiscal resulted from reduced demand from sun and the company s diversification into other markets  including the systems market 
the change in oem sales mix for fiscal resulted from the introduction of the high end mhz hypersparc and the resultant design wins at sun and fujitsu 
the change in oem sales mix for fiscal resulted from the introduction of the mhz hypersparc and the subsequent design wins at sun and fujitsu 
in addition  the company continued to develop its upgrade business during fiscal because sun and fujitsu currently account for a significant percentage of the company s net sales  a loss of either of these companies as a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
gross profit loss 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to a loss of in fiscal from a profit in fiscal  which was an increase from a profit of in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of a charge for the write down of inventory associated with lower speed microprocessor chips and associated semiconductors and mbus modules  including routine price degradation on older products  and to reductions in the valuation of inventory associated with workstation and server products which were ordered in anticipation of customer acceptance  which did not materialize to the degree anticipated by the company  as well as a million charge for the costs to cancel excess inventory purchase orders 
in addition gross profit was adversely affected by the company s lack of new  higher margin microprocessor and upgrade subsystem products  and also by an increase in manufacturing overhead associated with the assembly of fewer units in the later quarters of in a larger manufacturing space occupied during the fourth quarter of the improvement in gross profit margins in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to several factors relating to both net sales and cost of sales 
as a result of the company s introduction of the mhz hypersparc and the subsequent design wins at sun and fujitsu  net sales in fiscal increased over fiscal with respect to net sales  in the early stages of their product life cycles  high performance products such as the mhz hypersparc typically carry higher average selling prices and  consequently  higher gross profit 
furthermore  gross profit was adversely impacted during the first two quarters of fiscal because the company was required to significantly decrease the prices of its existing products which were at the end of their life cycle to maintain market presence 
as a result of the company s introduction of the mhz and mhz hypersparc products  as well as significant design wins from sun and fujitsu  the company was able to increase its average selling prices in the second half of fiscal and first half of fiscal furthermore  the introduction and sale of mhz hypersparc products during the third quarter of fiscal enabled the company to again increase its average selling prices in the second half of fiscal with respect to cost of sales  improving manufacturing yields from the company s wafer supplier during fiscal had a positive impact on the company s unit costs 
unit costs also declined in fiscal due to significant volume increases which resulted in increased efficiency and utilization of fixed manufacturing costs 
gross profit was also helped in fiscal by the continued contribution from upgrade products  which typically generate higher selling prices and gross profit than products sold to sun  fujitsu and other oem customers 
research and development 
research and development r d expense includes costs associated with the definition  design and development of new products 
r d expenses increased to million of sales in fiscal from million of sales in fiscal  which was an increase from million of sales in fiscal the increase in r d expenses was primarily attributable to the addition of new personnel and related overhead in the areas of new product design  new product development and increased pre production cost associated with qualifying new generation microprocessor products for production  and for new personnel and related overhead and outside contractor expenses for new product design and development related to the company s colorado hypersparc and next generation viper microprocessor designs 
in million of payments from fujitsu pursuant to a development agreement were applied against r d expenses 
the company believes that its r d activities are crucial to its future success and  therefore  expects r d expense to continue to rise in dollar terms  and potentially as a percentage of sales 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million of sales in fiscal from million of sales in fiscal  which was an increase from million of sales in fiscal the increase in sg a expenses during fiscal was primarily attributable to approximately million in write offs and increase in reserves associated with uncollectable accounts and also to increases in legal and consulting expenses relating to the negotiation of significant contracts and the hiring of new executive management and to increased expenses relating to advertising and promotion 
in and the company also experienced increased fees and expenses relating to its reporting obligations and other responsibilities as a publicly held company 
the increase in sg a expenses during fiscal was primarily attributable to the company s expansion of its sales and marketing staff and an increase in advertising activity in connection with the company s efforts to expand its oem market share and build sales of upgrade products 
the company expects that its sg a expense will decrease from fiscal levels in both dollar terms and as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to the unusual amount of delinquent accounts receivable recorded in sg a expense in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in sales related employees 
acquisition of in process research and development 
the acquisition of the assets of pequr in fiscal resulted in an allocation of million of the purchase price to in process r d which was expensed in fiscal amortization of goodwill 
goodwill of million arose in connection with the company s acquisition by fujitsu in and million arose from the acquisition of the assets of pequr by rcc 
these amounts are amortizable over six years resulting in million of amortization in fiscal and million in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company transferred its entire interest in rcc to fujitsu resulting in the removal of million of goodwill related to the acquisition of the assets of pequr 
in fiscal the company amortized the remainder of the goodwill million after reviewing its value in light of the losses incurred by the company in fiscal and cash flow projections 
net interest expense 
net interest expense of million in fiscal was approximately equal to the million of net interest expense in fiscal net of 
million in interest income and million in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company used million of the proceeds of its initial public offering to retire the outstanding balance under its line of credit with dai ichi kangyo bank dkb 
in fiscal the company again borrowed under a new credit facility with dkb 
see liquidity and capital resources 
income tax expense 
in fiscal the company incurred a significant loss 
based on the company s losses in fiscal and its continuing losses in the first quarter of fiscal  the company determined that it was more likely than not that it would not be able to use its entire income tax benefit in subsequent years 
the company also determined that it could not reasonably forecast the amount of such benefit it could use due to the significant changes being made with respect to its management and products 
accordingly  the company applied a reserve of approximately million against its deferred income tax asset 
as of april   the company had completely utilized its net operating loss carryforwards to that point for federal income tax purposes and  as a result  began accruing and paying regular federal income taxes 
current income tax expense for fiscal was million 
due to timing differences between book income and tax income  the company recognized a deferred tax benefit of million for book purposes during fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company began accruing and paying federal taxes as a result of the corporate alternative minimum tax 
future operating results 
the company s financial condition deteriorated significantly during fiscal  and at the end of the year  the company was continuing to experience significant losses from operations 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company hired a new senior management team to assess the company s business and to implement changes necessary to restore the company to a sound financial condition 
the company depends solely upon its parent  fujitsu limited  for additions to capital necessary to continue its operations 
while fujitsu has stated that  in accordance with our plan for ross technology  we fujitsu are ready to provide the necessary funding through debt guarantees or other types of financing for ross technology not to incur cash flow shortages through april   there can be no assurances that the company will not in the future require capital in addition to that committed by fujitsu 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the company s operating results have in the past and may in the future vary due to a number of factors  including market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  the company s success in entering new markets  the timing and extent of product development costs  changes in the mix of products sold and in the mix of sales by distribution channel  competitive pricing pressures  anticipated decreases in unit average selling prices of the company s products  availability and cost of products particularly silicon wafers from the company s suppliers  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  the gain or loss of significant customers  new product introductions by the company or the company s competitors  the competitiveness of the sparc architecture and the timing of significant orders  order cancellations or rescheduling  all as more fully described in the company s registration statement on form s which became effective november   and the final prospectus of the same date  and in the company s subsequent sec reports 
any unfavorable change in the foregoing or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company operates in an industry characterized by increasing competition  rapidly changing technology  and increasingly aggressive pricing 
as a result  the company s future operating results will depend to a considerable extent on its ability to rapidly and continuously  develop and introduce new microprocessor technologies that offer its customers enhanced performance at competitive prices 
the development of new high performance computer products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation from the company s designers and suppliers  as well as accurate anticipation of customers requirements and technological trends 
the company is also increasingly dependent on the ability of its suppliers to design  manufacture  and deliver advanced components required for the timely introduction of new products 
the failure of any of these suppliers to deliver components on time or in sufficient quantities  or the failure of any of the company s designers to develop advanced innovative products on a timely basis  could result in significant adverse impact on the company s operating results 
once a hardware product is developed  the company must rapidly bring it to volume manufacturing  a process that requires accurate forecasting of both volumes and configurations  among other things  in order to achieve competitive yields and costs 
upon introduction of new products  the company must also manage the transition from older  displaced products to minimize disruptions in customer ordering patterns  reduce levels of existing product inventory  and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
historically  average selling prices for microprocessors in general  and for the company s products in the time period during which they have been commercially available  have decreased over the life of each specific product 
the company expects that the average selling prices of its products will continue to be subject to significant downward pressure in the future 
if the company is unable to introduce and gain market acceptance of new products with higher average selling prices or reduce its costs sufficiently to offset decreases in prices of existing products  the company s gross profits and operating results would be adversely affected 
in addition  because the company is continuing to increase its operating expenses for new product development in anticipation of increasing sales levels  the company s business and operating results would be adversely affected if such sales levels were not achieved 
the company is currently involved in a significant effort to diversify its product lines and sources of revenue 
in fiscal and prior years  substantially all of the company s revenues were derived from sales of microprocessor chips  associated semiconductors and mbus modules 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company shipped hyperstation motherboards and systems in volume  which was the first time that the company had engaged in commercial sales of board and system products 
the company intends to pursue and expand its board and systems businesses  which will focus on performance and value enhanced products incorporating the sparc industry standard v architecture 
the company also intends to continue its microprocessor chip and mbus module businesses 
the company believes that diversification of its product lines and revenue sources will provide additional engines for future revenues and profits 
there can be no assurance  however  that this diversification effort will be successful or profitable  and the company s entry into this new business area entails new product acceptance  inventory and accounts receivable collection risks as well as longer payment terms 
it also requires the development of new distribution channels and new marketing strategies 
the company anticipates that the gross profit margins of these new product lines will be lower than those it has historically experienced in the oem microprocessor chip and upgrade subsystem module businesses 
also  for sales of certain products through distributors  the company is able to recognize revenue from such sales only upon resale to end users 
as noted above  the company has recently experienced lower than expected demand for a number of its products  especially its lower speed microprocessor chips and associated semiconductors and mbus modules  as well as routine price degradation on older products 
these trends are continuing and are expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
in addition  operating results could be adversely affected by general economic and other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending or a downturn in the markets for microprocessors or high performance computer workstations 
in order to increase competitiveness and market share  in january the company announced significant price reductions for its existing hyperstation and sparcplug systems and upgrade subsystem module products  reflecting a thorough cost analysis and adjustments to the company s pricing model to adopt the lower margins of the computer systems industry 
sales to sun  historically the company s largest oem customer  have varied substantially on a year to year and quarter to quarter basis over the periods since fiscal as previously advised  the company anticipates that sales to sun will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
the company continues to pursue sales to sun of its current and future microprocessor products  but there can be no assurance that the company will achieve any future design wins with sun 
during the recent past  the company s revenues and gross profit margins have been substantially impacted by the mix of oem  system and upgrade subsystem module customers  as well as by the mix of high end and low end products sold and the availability of new  higher priced and higher margin microprocessor and upgrade subsystem module products 
in addition  because the company is continuing to incur substantial operating expenses for new product development in anticipation of increasing sales levels and to remain competitive  the company s business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected if such sales levels were not achieved 
although the company is taking actions to improve operating margins  it is anticipated that gross profit will continue to remain under pressure for the foreseeable future due to a variety of factors  including lower margins for system products  continued industry wide pricing pressures  increased competition  and compressed product life cycles 
r d expenses are expected to increase  reflecting pre production qualification of the colorado hypersparc microprocessor and new product design and development related to the viper generation of microprocessors that the company expects to introduce in the company expects that the level of sg a expenses will vary depending upon the overall sales effort undertaken and the company s distribution strategies 
although r d and sg a expenses can be reduced over time if the company s revenues are less than anticipated  the company believes that it is building an infrastructure that is critical to the company s future success and that represents a long term investment in the company s future 
therefore  as in the recent past  the company may decide to undertake such expenses even if the result would be an increase in such categories of expense as a percentage of net sales in a given fiscal quarter or for a fiscal year as a whole 
the company expects interest expenses to be substantially higher on a quarterly basis during fiscal as a result of the company s increased borrowing requirements 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the company has lost a number of executives  engineers and other employees due to voluntary resignations 
the loss of executives and other key employees has negatively affected the overall quality and depth of the company s staff infrastructure and its management and accounting controls 
the company is seeking to remedy these shortcomings as a priority matter through new hiring and the use of consultants and outside contractors 
however  the impaired infrastructure and controls may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has recently filled key management positions  including a chief executive officer and president  a chief financial officer  a vice president of sales and other key positions in sales  product engineering  finance and accounting 
given the company s recent performance and financial condition  hiring staff is difficult 
although no decisions have been made  the company anticipates that it may need to implement additional incentive compensation programs in order to attract and retain key employees and to motivate employees 
liquidity and capital resources the company experienced significant negative cash flows during fiscal and at the end of that year had negative working capital and negative stockholders equity 
the company is dependent on its parent company  fujitsu  for its capital requirements 
in november the company established a new credit facility with dai ichi kangyo bank  limited dkb for a maximum of million  in february such new credit facility was increased to a maximum of million 
the new credit facility expires on december   as a result of an extension in june  and is guaranteed by fujitsu 
at march   and june   the amounts outstanding under the new credit facility were and million  respectively 
on june   the company received a commitment from fujitsu that  in accordance with our plan for ross technology  we fujitsu are ready to provide the necessary funding through debt guarantees or other types of financing for ross technology not to incur cash flow shortages through april  accordingly  the company believes that it will have adequate capital for its business through april  however  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience negative cash flow from operations and the company may in the future be required to seek additional external sources of financing for its operating needs 
there can be no assurance that additional capital  including capital from bank borrowings  will be available on terms favorable to the company  if at all  or that fujitsu would be willing to provide additional loan guarantees  equity infusions or other financial assistance to the company in the future 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would likely result in substantial dilution to the company s then existing stockholders 
in view of its position as the company s controlling stockholder  fujitsu s concurrence is necessary for the issuance of any additional debt or equity financing by the company 
the company s failure to obtain sufficient additional financing could make it impossible for it to continue operations  force the company to seek protection under federal bankruptcy law and or affect the company s listing on the nasdaq national market 
the company s principal source of liquidity as of march   consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents and million of unused credit availability pursuant to its loan with dkb 
as of march   the company had negative working capital of million  an accumulated deficit of million  and stockholders deficit of million 
during fiscal the company extended payment terms with many suppliers in order to increase the availability of on hand cash 
as a result the company experienced difficulty in procuring inventory and subcontract manufacturing services from some suppliers 
at the present time the company is not in compliance with the agreed payment terms with many of its suppliers and there can be no assurance that such suppliers will continue to ship supplies to the company if the company does not comply with such terms 
during fiscal  operating activities used cash of million  compared with generating million of cash in fiscal  due primarily to a net loss of million in fiscal compared with net income of million in fiscal net inventory decreased million as a result of write downs for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
accounts payable increased million due to the company s taking longer to pay amounts due 
the company s payable to fujitsu decreased million due primarily to payment of overdue invoices 
the company s investing activities in fiscal used million of cash  a decrease from approximately million for fiscal the higher amount in fiscal was primarily attributable to the company s occupying a larger manufacturing facility  resulting in associated higher equipment and leasehold improvement costs 
cash generated by financing activities increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal the company borrowed million under the new credit facility from dkb 
in fiscal the company completed its initial public offering  which generated million and was used in part to repay the original dkb credit facility of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company repaid the outstanding principal amount of million under its revolving line of credit with dkb using proceeds from the company s initial public offering on november  from july to november   all of the company s bank borrowings were pursuant to the dkb credit facility 
the dkb credit facility expired upon repayment 
all of the company s current borrowings are pursuant to the new credit facility 
the company s payment terms with fujitsu for purchases of silicon wafers and mdps are longer than those generally available from other suppliers 
although the company believes that such payment terms will not change in the near future  there can be no assurance that fujitsu will continue to extend such favorable payment terms to the company 
shorter payment terms would increase the company s cash requirements 
the company anticipates that total payments under all operating leases currently in place will be approximately million and million for each of fiscal and  respectively 
these leases primarily cover the company s existing administrative and test facilities 
the company intends to incur additional capital expenditures of approximately million during the next months  principally for computer hardware and software  lab equipment and general office equipment and furnishings 
because the company must order raw materials  silicon wafers and components and build finished goods inventory substantially in advance of product shipments  there is continued risk that the company will forecast quantity and product mix incorrectly and  therefore  produce excess or insufficient inventories 
because the markets for the company s microprocessor  module and system products are subject to rapid technological and price changes  inventory may be subject to rapid obsolescence 
the inventory risk is heightened because the company s customers usually place orders with short lead times 
if the company forecasts incorrectly and produces insufficient inventory of particular products  the company may face order cancellations from or loss of customers  who may seek to satisfy their needs from other suppliers 
in general  the company s customers may change delivery schedules or cancel orders without penalty 
to the extent that the company produces excess or insufficient inventories of particular products  or inventory becomes obsolete  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
based on the commitment from fujitsu and the company s current operating plan  the company believes that its cash requirements will be met through april  beyond that time  the company may require additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional capital  including capital from bank borrowings  will be available on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders 
moreover  the company s cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in the company s business or capital expenditure plans  product plans or technology roadmap  changes in the company s level of product and manufacturing integration  results of research and development  relationships with suppliers and customers  changes in the focus and direction of the company s research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the level of working capital required to sustain planned growth  operating results including the extent and duration of operating losses  facilities  employment matters  and other factors
