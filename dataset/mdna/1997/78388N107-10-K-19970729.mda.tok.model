item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company derives substantially all of its revenue from providing it consulting  outsourcing  and professional staffing services 
the increase in revenue from million in fiscal to million in fiscal is a function of two principal factors i an increase in the volume of services provided as measured by aggregate hours billed  and ii a shift in the mix of services provided from lower rate professional staffing services to higher rate consulting and outsourcing services 
in general  revenue is recognized by the company as services are performed 
the company s third fiscal quarter ending january  in which the number of holidays and employee vacation days reduces the company s employee billable hours  generally reflects lower revenue and profitability in comparison to the other three fiscal quarters 
the company has historically derived a significant portion of its revenue from a relatively limited number of clients 
the company currently performs services for approximately clients  consisting of state and local governments  public utilities  fortune companies  and other large organizations 
for the fiscal years ended april    and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenue was attributable to governmental and quasi governmental entities such as public utilities  with the balance attributable to commercial enterprises 
for the fiscal years ended april    and  the company s top five clients in terms of revenue to the company accounted for approximately   and of the company s revenue  respectively 
from time to time the company has substantial accounts receivable from its top five clients  but the company has not experienced any significant payment problems from these clients 
a material decrease in services provided to any of the largest clients of the company could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
in july  the company learned that its outsourcing contract with nes would terminate in accordance with its terms in november without renewal 
for the fiscal year ended april   the nes contract accounted for approximately of the company s revenue 
with the company s anticipated growth in revenues and the redevelopment of employees dedicated to the nes contract  the company believes that the termination of such contract will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company s strategy has been to sustain growth in professional staffing revenue while simultaneously increasing the percentage of revenue contributed by consulting and outsourcing services 
generally  the company charges its clients higher hourly rates for consulting and outsourcing services than for professional staffing services 
the company s marketing strategy emphasizes cross selling all of its services to existing and potential clients 
in addition to expanding existing client relationships  the company has made a strategic determination to seek more high value  premium billing business  concentrating particularly on increasing its consulting  client server  and other network engagements  as evidenced by the company s recent commitment to expanding its year and telecommunications consulting service offerings 
the company s growth in fiscal has been significantly affected by acquisition activity 
in september  the company effected a business combination with delta  an information technology consulting company and custom software programmer 
in february  the company acquired substantially all of the assets of tmri  an information technology consulting company 
see item business acquisitions 
the delta merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and the company s historical financial statements and management s discussion thereof have been restated to include the financial position and results of operations for delta for periods prior to the merger 
the tmri transaction was accounted for as a purchase and goodwill of approximately million will be amortized ratably over a thirty year period 
with the addition of delta and tmri  the distinctions between the company s previously identified lines of business  into consulting services  outsourcing services  and professional staffing services  have become less meaningful 
accordingly  revenue growth attributable to these lines of business  which has previously been provided  is no longer considered by the company to be material to investors 
prior to the delta merger  delta had elected s corporation status for federal income tax purposes 
as a result of the merger  delta s s corporation status was terminated 
accordingly  certain pro forma information is presented in the company s consolidated statements of income as if delta had been a c corporation for tax purposes during the periods presented
