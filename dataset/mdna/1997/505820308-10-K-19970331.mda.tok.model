year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company s gross revenues rose from million in to million in  a increase 
the increase in gross revenues of million is primarily from the operations of lady luck rhythm blues which generated million in gross revenues for  an increase of million over the million generated by lady luck rhythm blues during after its casino opened on june   offset partially by lady luck tunica which had no revenues in  but which generated million in gross revenues during  and by an million reduction in gross revenues from lady luck natchez during as compared to the same period in during the eight months ended december   the company also recognized lease income of million for the lease of a gaming vessel and equipment to the bettendorf joint venture

this decrease is primarily attributable to the unusually high selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues for lady luck tunica in  due to its closing april   and also due to implementation of steps  during  to reduce corporate overhead costs and focus development efforts on those projects which the company believes have the highest probability of success

certain risks and uncertainties the company s operations in mississippi  iowa and colorado are dependent on the continued licensability or qualification of the company and its subsidiaries that hold the gaming licenses in these jurisdictions 
such licensing and qualifications are reviewed periodically by the gaming authorities in those states 
in addition  the company s directors and many of the employees of casinos are required to obtain gaming licenses 
the failure of the company or any of its key personnel to obtain or retain a license in a particular jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to continue its current gaming operations or to obtain or retain licenses in other jurisdictions 
in addition  any regulations adopted by the gaming commissions  the legislatures or any governmental authority having jurisdiction in mississippi  colorado  missouri  iowa  or other jurisdictions in which the company has or intends to have gaming operations may materially adversely affect the company s operations 
mississippi gaming commission regulations require licensees to invest certain minimum amounts in land based  non gaming infrastructure the land based requirement 
while the mississippi gaming commission the commission previously expressed concern as to whether llb is in compliance with such requirements  the commission found  subsequent to december   that llb did in fact comply with the land based requirement 
a significant portion of the company s consolidated revenues and operating income are generated by the company s rhythm blues and country casino gaming operations in coahoma county  mississippi 
these casinos are highly dependent on patronage by residents of arkansas 
a change in general economic conditions or the extent and nature of regulations enabling casino gaming in arkansas could adversely effect these casinos future operating results 
in arkansas  a gaming referendum  which  if passed  would have legalized certain forms of gaming at certain locations  was defeated in november if gaming were legalized in certain areas of arkansas  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s coahoma county facilities and the bally s saloon and gambling hall 
the company believes that its gaming markets are extremely competitive and expects them to become even more competitive as the number of gaming and other entertainment establishments increases 
such competition is particularly intense in the colorado and mississippi markets and the company also competes with gaming facilities nationwide 
it is also possible that substantial local and nationwide competition could cause the supply of gaming facilities to exceed the demand for gaming 
additionally  certain of the company s competitors have more gaming industry experience  larger operations or significantly greater financial and other resources than the company 
given these factors it is possible that substantial competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations 
the company is highly leveraged 
as of december   the company s total long term indebtedness was approximately million and its stockholders equity was approximately million 
this level of indebtedness could have important consequences to stockholders 
while management believes the company will have sufficient cash flow to meet its debt service and other cash outflow requirements and maintain compliance with the covenants of the indenture as supplemented  to the extent that a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness  such cash flow would not be available for other purposes such as general operations  maintenance and improvement of casino and hotel facilities or expansion of existing sites or into other gaming markets 
furthermore  the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited and the company s level of indebtedness could limit its flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its industry 
the company currently estimates that it will cost approximately an additional million to complete development of the first two phases of the missouri project and an additional million to complete development of the vicksburg project 
the company has entered into an agreement of general partnership for a joint venture with davis gaming company ii with respect to the missouri project which would reduce the company s future capital commitments to zero with respect to such project 
however  there can be no assurance that the kimmswick joint venture will be consummated 
in addition  davis has entered into a gaming joint venture with another party in missouri 
if the kimmswick joint venture is not consummated  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to implement its business strategy with regard to the missouri project 
the company has ceased committing material amounts of capital to the vicksburg project and is actively seeking joint venture partners to finance its completion 
see business development stage projects 
rising costs and capital constraints have forced the company to seek joint venture partners to complete the development of the development stage projects and may further suspend or delay certain projects  including the pre development stage projects 
the company believes that  unless it is able to raise additional capital through equipment or bank financing  joint venture arrangements  dispositions of non essential assets  or issuances of additional debt or equity securities  while simultaneously reducing expenses  it will not be able to complete any of the development stage projects or pursue further the pre development stage projects 
there can be no assurance that additional capital  whether from equity or debt financing or other sources  will be available  or if available  will be on terms satisfactory to the company 
long lived assets  which are not to be disposed of  including property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the asset is compared to the carrying amount to determine whether an impairment exists 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on the best information available  including considering prices for similar assets and the results of valuation techniques to the extent available 
the company has evaluated the recoverability of llb s and gci s long lived assets as of december  pursuant to financial accounting standards board statement no 
in performing its review for recoverability  the company compared the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of llb s and gci s long lived assets 
the carrying value of llb s and gci s long lived assets were million and million  respectively  at december  as the estimated undiscounted future cash flows exceeded the carrying value of long lived assets  the company was not permitted or required to recognize an impairment loss 
circumstances affecting management s estimates of future undiscounted cash flow to be generated by llb and gci could differ in future periods and result in a significant write down
