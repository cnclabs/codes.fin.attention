these forward looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions 
certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements are set forth below in the investment considerations section 
earnings summary teco energy achieved earnings of per share in compared to in  a percent increase 
these results were achieved after the deferral of million of revenues at tampa electric under agreements approved by the florida public service commission fpsc described in the utility regulation section 
results in reflect the deferral of million of revenues at tampa electric under the agreement approved by the fpsc described in the utility regulation section 
earnings in were after a cent charge for corporate restructuring which included a reduction in staffing levels and other cost reductions  primarily at tampa electric 
earnings growth in and was driven by strong performance at the diversified companies as well as continued growth in energy sales  lower operations and maintenance expenses  and higher levels of capitalized financing costs afudc  primarily associated with the investment in the polk power station at tampa electric

consolidated operating income rose in despite the deferral of million of revenues at tampa electric under agreements approved by the fpsc described in the utility regulation section 
higher consolidated operating income in was the result of the strong performance of the diversified companies  particularly teco transport trade  and growth at tampa electric 
the improved results were achieved even after the deferral of million of revenues at tampa electric under the agreement approved by the fpsc described in the utility regulation section 
the following table identifies the unconsolidated revenues and operating income of the significant operating groups

operating income includes items which are reclassified for consolidated financial statement purposes 
the principal items are the n o n conventional fuels tax credit related to coalbed methane production and interest expense on the non recourse debt related to the independent power operations 
in the consolidated statements of income  the tax credit is part of the provision for income taxes and the interest is part of interest expense 
certain amounts have been restated to conform to current year presentation 
excludes the effects of a corporate restructuring which reduced operating income million at tampa electric and million at the diversified companies 
tampa electric s operating results tampa electric s operating income increased more than six percent after the deferral of million of revenues under the agreements described in the utility regulation section 
two percent customer growth and colder than normal weather early in the year contributed to five percent higher total energy sales 
non fuel operations and maintenance expenses were one percent below levels  despite a full quarter of operations of the polk power station  reflecting the continued focus on aggressive cost management throughout the company 
tampa electric s operating income also increased because of the inclusion of the polk power station in rate base for earnings purposes upon commencement of commercial operation late in the third quarter 
in tampa electric successfully completed the construction of the megawatt  state of the art  clean coal technology polk power station 
the addition of this facility will cause an increase in tampa electric s operating expenses 
however  during the first two years of operations the u 
s 
department of energy doe will provide funding that will offset a portion of the non fuel operations and maintenance expenses associated with the facility 
agreements approved by the fpsc allowing full recovery of capital costs and operations and maintenance expenses associated with the plant described in the utility regulation section  are in place 
tampa electric s operating income increased two percent over s 
higher base revenues from retail customer growth  favorable weather and an improved economy together with lower operating expenses contributed to the improved results after the deferral of million of revenues 
tampa electric results change change millions revenues   
 operating expenses 
operating income restructuring charge included in operating expenses above operating income before restructuring charge and tampa electric revenues are net of million and million  respectively  of revenues deferred under agreements as described in the utility regulation section 
tampa electric s operating revenues tampa electric s revenues increased almost two percent to billion  after the deferral of million of revenues  reflecting customer growth of more than two percent and increased retail energy usage 
tampa electric s revenues decreased slightly as the deferral of million of revenues offset increased energy sales 
the economy in tampa electric s service area continued to grow in due to increased employment from corporate relocations and expansions 
combined residential and commercial energy sales grew by more than three percent in non phosphate industrial sales declined in due to the closure of a brewery at the end of sales to the phosphate industry decreased in reflecting the closure of some depleted phosphate mines and reduced production at several processing plants 
energy sales to the phosphate industry are expected to increase in over levels from increased production to meet continued strong domestic and international demand for phosphate products 
after sales are expected to decline slowly as mining activity migrates out of tampa electric s service area 
in sales to the phosphate customer group represented about five percent of total operating revenues 
in may imc agrico  a large phosphate producer representing four percent of revenues  issued a request for proposals rfp for electric power to serve load currently served by tampa electric and others 
some portions of the services identified in the rfp are not permitted under current florida laws and utility regulation 
tampa electric has made load retention proposals that it believes to be competitively priced and attractive because of the flexibility offered  and continues to have discussions with imc agrico 
while it is unclear how this process will develop  the ultimate impact on tampa electric is not expected to be material 
for a general description of competition see the utility competition section 
tampa electric s and independent forecasts indicate that in the tampa electric service area economy is expected to grow moderately at rates higher than the country as a whole 
the local economy continues to benefit from a good labor market  available land  good access through airport and port facilities and aggressive economic development activities by the communities served by tampa electric 
based on the expected continued growth of the local economy with both population and business activity increases  tampa electric projects retail energy sales growth of more than two percent annually for the next five years 
this forecast includes combined energy sales growth in the residential and commercial sectors of almost three percent annually as the tampa electric service area economy becomes more service oriented 
growth in energy sales to non phosphate industrial customers is expected in after the decline 
non fuel revenues from sales to other utilities were million in  million in and million in energy sold to other utilities increased in due to weather related demand and lower tampa electric fuel costs 
a shift from broker system economy sales to longer term  higher margin wholesale power sales resulted in a seven percent increase in revenues in in energy sold to o t h e r utilities increased because of higher generating unit availability and lower fuel costs at tampa electric 
signing additional longer term wholesale power sales agreements remains a priority at tampa electric  where in recent years bulk power sales contracts of varying size and duration have been added 
competitive pricing of coal fired generation has allowed tampa electric to market available capacity successfully 
tampa electric megawatt hour sales change change thousands residential    commercial    industrial    other    total retail    sales for resale    total energy sold    retail customers average tampa electric s operating expenses effective cost management and improved efficiency continue to be principal objectives at tampa electric

total operating expenses 
a g g ressive cost management reduced non fuel operations and maintenance expenses more than one percent in  despite the additional expenses related to the operation of the polk power station 
in non fuel operations and maintenance expenses declined almost five percent from levels before the restructuring charge 
the million reduction in was primarily from lower payroll and employee related expenses as a result of fewer positions than in in both and tampa electric achieved lower costs from equipment redesign and enhancements  work redesign efforts including the streamlining of maintenance programs  the sharing of manpower r e sources in power generation facilities and the use of new technologies throughout the company 
in the savings realized from these efforts more than offset increased operations and maintenance expenses from the polk power station 
over the next several years  non fuel operations and maintenance expenses are expected to remain at levels 
during the first two years of operations  when specified domestic coals will be evaluated for use in the gasifier  tampa electric will receive up to a total of million from doe for operations and maintenance expenses of the polk power station 
based on current forecasts this funding is expected to offset a significant portion of the non fuel operating costs of the new plant during this period 
total operating expenses in included the million restructuring charge discussed in the earnings summary section and the first annual million charge to a transmission and distribution property storm damage reserve in accordance with regulatory directives described in the utility regulation section 
depreciation expense increased million in from normal plant additions and the completion of the polk power station 
depreciation expense in decreased as certain shorter lived assets were fully amortized 
this decrease more than offset the impact of normal additions to plant and equipment 
tampa electric s efforts to reduce capital investment in recent years have limited additions to all asset classes 
depreciation expense is projected to increase again in as a result of a full year of depreciation of the polk power station 
changes in taxes other than those on income reflected increased state gross receipts taxes and franchise fees associated with higher energy sales  changes in property values and decreases in payroll related taxes as a result of the restructuring 
taxes other than those on income are expected to increase in as a result of the property taxes associated with the polk power station 
total system fuel cost in was less than one percent higher than in despite a five percent increase in total energy sales 
the success in controlling fuel cost is a result of tampa electric s use of lower priced coals and the mix in operating generating units 
average coal costs  on a cents per million btu basis  declined more than six percent in after a three percent decrease in fuel and purchased power cost rose one percent in despite a five percent rise in retail energy sales 
tampa electric purchased more power in both and primarily to meet weather related demand 
substantially all fuel and purchased power expenses were recovered through the fuel adjustment clause 
nearly all of tampa electric s generation in the last three years has been from coal  and the fuel mix will continue to be substantially coal 
external forecasts indicate relatively stable coal prices during the next few years compared to oil or gas prices 
tampa electric continues to work to reduce its fuel cost through effective contract management  use of non traditional fuels such as petroleum coke and tire derived fuel  and increased purchases of coal in the lower cost spot market 
diversified companies operating results the diversified companies achieved operating income of million in compared with million in and million in before the restructuring charge 
the improved results in were driven by higher gas prices throughout the year at teco coalbed methane as well as teco power services full year of operations at the alborada power station in guatemala 
the increase in was the result of strong performances at all of the diversified companies  led by teco transport trade 
increased third party sales at teco coal and teco power services guatemalan power project were other important contributors 
diversified companies results unconsolidated change change millions revenues operating expenses operating income restructuring charge included in operating expenses above operating income before restructuring charge operating income includes items which are reclassified for consolidated financial statement purposes 
the principal items are the n o n conventional fuels tax credit related to coalbed methane production and interest expense on the non recourse debt related to independent power operations  both of which are included in operating income for the diversified companies 
in the consolidated statements of income the tax credit is part of the provision for income taxes and the interest is part of interest expense 
certain amounts have been restated to conform to the current year presentation 
teco coalbed methane s operating income increased as a result of average gas prices almost percent higher than levels 
gas prices rose in on extreme winter weather and lower than normal levels of natural gas inventories at the end of the heating season 
production declined slightly to billion cubic feet bcf from bcf in teco coalbed methane has an active program of reworking and enhancing existing wells to increase production  extend the life of the wells  and add to reserves 
these efforts have reduced the decline in production to about three percent per year  half of the originally estimated rate of decline 
at year end proven reserves were estimated to be bcf 
in operating income increased  despite gas prices that were significantly lower than in  as production rose to bcf  up from bcf in lower gas prices were more than offset by a five percent increase in production  a percent reduction in operating costs  and a million pretax settlement related to the termination of a gas sales contract and related agreements 
in both and teco coalbed methane acquired interests in additional reserves in alabama s black warrior basin through the purchase of royalty interests in wells located on or near teco coalbed methane s existing holdings 
the company continually seeks additional investment opportunities to add to its holdings  but no acquisitions were made in production from teco coalbed methane s reserves are eligible for non conventional fuels tax credits under section of the internal revenue code through the year the credit  which grows with inflation  was estimated at per thousand cubic feet mcf in all gas produced is sold under contract at spot market prices for the life of the reserves 
natural gas prices have been subject to significant volatility since late  but have generally trended upward 
the section tax credits provide some degree of stability to teco coalbed methane s operating results 
to date  financial market instruments have not been used to manage exposure to gas price volatility 
teco power services achieved higher operating income in from a full year of operation of the alborada power station in guatemala 
the station commenced commercial operation and began contributing to earnings in september the station supplies megawatts of power to a local distribution utility under a year power sales agreement 
early in teco power service increased its percentage of ownership from percent to percent 
the million non recourse project debt financing for the project was completed in january in teco power services formed a partnership with the same guatemalan business interest it partnered with for the alborada power station and with coastal corporation to build  own and operate a megawatt pulverized coal fired power plant  the san jose power station in guatemala 
the partnership signed a year power supply agreement with the same guatemalan distribution utility 
design and engineering for the million plant are underway and construction is scheduled to be completed by mid teco power services domestic project  the hardee power station in west central florida  continues to operate reliably  supplying power to seminole electric cooperative and tampa electric 
teco transport trade achieved higher operating income in in both the ocean going business and at the transfer terminal 
the river business benefited from strong demand and increased northbound business  but higher fuel prices more than offset the higher revenues 
the addition of new barges increased the fleet size to almost barges 
the ocean shipping business increased its capacity  adding a  ton ship in mid year 
it moved higher volumes of coal to tampa electric and phosphate 
the effects of this growth were partially offset by higher costs from severe weather delays and fuel 
the transfer terminal handled slightly lower quantities of export coal as a result of changes in shipping rates for international coal shipments between the far east and europe 
this impact was more than offset by improved pricing on the coal moved for export and increased tonnage of coal transferred for tampa electric 
the ocean shipping business expects to benefit from the continued strong demand for phosphate products world wide  and from further diversification into new markets and cargoes in the significant factors which could influence results are weather  commodity grain prices and economic activity both domestically and overseas 
the conditions affecting favorable pricing and strong demand at the river company in returned to normal in late as a result of lower grain inventories and reduced grain shipments  partially offset by new demand created by the steel industry 
the pricing and demand conditions experienced on the mississippi river in late are expected to continue in transfers of export coal are expected to i n crease in from increased shipments of u 
s 
coal to international markets 
teco transport trade s operating income increased significantly in reflecting improved results in all of its businesses 
the river business in particular had an excellent year as a result of higher volumes and prices 
improved fleet utilization and increased levels of northbound shipments contributed to increased volumes 
a strong demand for northbound movements and a record grain harvest together with a better balance in the supply and demand for barges caused stronger prices throughout the industry 
the transfer facility at the mouth of the mississippi river handled more coal tonnage for tampa electric and third party export business 
the ocean shipping business benefited from increased shipments of phosphate and higher shipments of coal to tampa electric in teco coal s operating income was lower primarily due to a million pretax gain from a road condemnation settlement in in the effects of strong growth in third party sales and some improvement in prices for coal from the newer premier mines were more than offset by higher production costs  lower shipments to tampa electric and million of pretax expenses related to closing certain older gatliff mines 
success in burning more conventional and lower cost steam coals has enabled tampa electric to adopt a competitive strategy of phasing down coal shipments from teco coal for the last several years 
shipments to tampa electric declined by about percent in both and because of this decrease and high production costs  gatliff closed several mines in shipments to tampa electric are expected to decline by percent in shipments to other customers continued to increase in with total tonnage up more than percent to million tons  compared to million tons in and million tons in growth from sales of steam coal to other utilities and metallurgical and stoker coal to industrial customers  more than offset reduced tonnage to tampa electric 
i n september teco coal acquired million tons of metallurgical grade coal reserves contiguous to its existing clintwood operations  and began construction of a new preparation plant 
this facility will support an additional million tons of annual production when it goes in service in mid metallurgical coal has unique characteristics and is sold primarily to the steel industry both domestically and internationally 
teco coal expects to use the additional production to increase its share in this market segment 
teco coal expects sales to third parties to increase again in as eastern utilities meet increasing demand for electric power with existing coal fired generating capacity and use low sulfur coal to comply with the clean air act amendments 
substantially all of the production from the premier mines is committed through shipments from the premier mines and the clintwood expansion are expected to more than offset the impact of reduced tonnage to tampa electric in teco oil gas was formed in to participate in joint ventures in the exploration and development of oil and gas in the shallow gulf waters off texas and louisiana 
teco oil gas made significant progress in and operated at almost break even in its first full year of operation 
teco oil gas accounts for its operations on the successful efforts basis  expensing unsuccessful exploratory wells currently 
making extensive use of d seismic imaging technology the joint ventures successfully completed six of nine exploratory wells in three wells began producing in  but one has since been abandoned 
the other three successful exploratory wells began producing early in also in early  two additional wells were drilled  one successfully 
teco oil gas s share of production was two bcf and its net proven reserves at dec 
 were bcf from two wells 
based on current production rates and test results  teco oil gas s share of production is expected to exceed bcf 
teco oil gas had federal off shore leases as of dec 
 and  in early  was the successful bidder for five additional federal leases 
the joint ventures expect to expand the offshore exploration activities in  a new on shore exploration program has been launched in the permian basin area of west texas 
in this venture teco oil gas will hold an increased interest and will be the operator 
the company expects to commit million to million per year during the next few years for further exploration and development 
tecom  a subsidiary organized in  is marketing an advanced energy management  automation and control systems for residential and commercial applications  called the interlane system 
several utilities are engaged in projects demonstrating the interlane product 
in tecom was issued its first patent covering the system design concept for the interlane products  other patent applications are pending 
because of a continued high level of product enhancement activity  tecom capitalized million pretax of product development costs in in accordance with accepted accounting practices  product development costs capitalized in and those to be capitalized in are expected to be amortized starting in when tecom anticipates its products will be available for general distribution 
general distribution of the product will depend on a number of factors including market acceptance 
diversified companies operating revenues in the diversified companies achieved an percent increase in revenues 
the largest increases occurred at teco coal from higher sales to third parties  at teco coalbed methane from higher gas prices  and at teco power services from a full year of operations at the alborada power station in guatemala 
diversified companies revenues also increased significantly reflecting improved performance at all of the companies 
revenues in also included million at teco coal from the sale of land and mineral rights under a condemnation settlement with the state of k e ntucky  and million at teco coalbed methane from the termination of a gas sales contract 
diversified companies operating expenses diversified companies operating expenses increased almost percent in difficult underground mining conditions at teco coal s gatliff mines increased costs and led to the closing of several mines 
higher fuel prices at teco transport trade  and a full year of operations at teco oil gas and teco power services alborada power station also contributed to increased operating expenses 
diversified companies operating expenses increased two percent in teco power services incurred higher expenses because of increased power generation at the hardee power station and the new alborada power station in guatemala 
the diversified companies recorded a charge of million for corporate restructuring in related to reductions in staffing levels and other costs 
non operating items other income expense other income consisted mostly of allowance for other funds used during construction afudc of million in  million in  and million in with the construction of tampa electric s polk unit one now complete  afudc will decline to minimal levels for the next several years 
interest charges interest charges were million in  up four percent from primarily due to the expiration of an interest rate swap agreement 
interest charges in were million  up eight percent from due to higher short term debt balances and rates 
income taxes income tax expense increased in and primarily from increases in pretax income 
income tax expense as a percent of income before taxes was percent in  percent in and percent in pretax income in was affected by the restructuring charge 
total income tax expense was reduced by the federal tax credit related to the production of coalbed methane 
these tax credits totaled million in  million in and million in the tax credit rate was estimated at per mcf in  up from in and in this rate escalates with inflation and could be limited by domestic oil prices 
in domestic oil prices would have had to exceed per barrel for this limitation to have been effective 
the federal tax credit on production of coalbed methane is available through the year merger and acquisition activities lykes energy inc in november teco energy announced an agreement with lykes energy t o merge it into teco energy in a tax free  stock for stock transaction with an equity value of million 
the number of teco energy shares to be issued will depend on the average market price during a specified period prior to the closing  subject to a collar 
based on teco energy s common stock closing price of on feb 
  approximately million shares would be issued  representing about a percent increase in shares outstanding 
this merger  to be accounted for as a pooling of interests  was approved by both companies boards of directors and in december by the lykes energy shareholders 
approval by teco energy s shareholders is not required 
the principal subsidiary of lykes energy is peoples gas system  a regulated retail natural gas distributor in florida 
peoples gas system is florida s largest natural gas distribution company with retail operations in all of the state s major metropolitan communities and over  customers 
it recorded annual sales of bcf of natural gas in fiscal it will be merged into tampa electric but operated as a separate business unit 
also continuing operations as a separate business will be peoples gas company  a propane business  and another unit involved in natural gas marketing 
teco energy expects some cost savings and efficiencies as a result of the merger 
savings are mainly expected to be derived from the elimination of duplicative overhead and administrative activities  as well as improved operating efficiencies and lower interest costs 
in addition  teco energy expects to benefit from expanding energy demand in areas already served by these businesses and from opportunities to secure new customers in other areas 
the merger is subject to certain closing conditions with closing expected by mid year effects of the merger teco energy anticipates that the merger with lykes energy will initially be slightly dilutive to earnings with favorable future growth prospects 
the merger will further teco energy s strategy of p u rsuing growth in energy related businesses 
it will provide opportunities for growth in new energy markets by adding natural gas and propane distribution and commodity sales to the company s existing w h o l esale and retail electric operations and gas production activities 
additional growth opportunities will arise from geographic expansion beyond tampa electric s  square mile service area through participation in the gas energy markets in all major metropolitan areas of florida 
teco energy expects to take advantage of possible growth opportunities by supporting a larger capital construction program for peoples gas system 
the merger will also permit the company to better meet its customers needs through a broader range of energy services 
in particular  it will allow full service with either gas or electric energy to wholesale customers in peninsular florida and to retail customers in the limited area served by both tampa electric and peoples gas system  as well as facilitate energy services offerings and expanded power marketing activities

bga is headquartered in tampa and has seven offices in florida and two in california 
it provides design  engineering and construction services to more than customers  including public schools  universities  health care facilities and other governmental facilities throughout florida and california 
teco energy s results only include the results of bga subsequent to the acquisition 
accounting standards stock options in the financial accounting standards board issued fas  accounting for stock options  effective for fiscal years beginning after dec 
 fas encourages  but does not require  companies to recognize compensation expense based on fair value of grants of stock  stock options and other equity instruments to employees 
although expense recognition for employee stock based compensation is not mandatory  fas requires non adopting companies to disclose pro forma net income and earnings per share 
teco energy has continued to apply the prior accounting rules  and the pro forma adjustments to net income and earnings per share are shown in note b on page of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fas fas  accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas  effective for years beginning after dec 
  requires that long lived assets and certain intangibles to be held and used by the company be reviewed for impairment 
the company periodically assesses whether there has been a permanent impairment of its long lived assets  in accordance with fas no write down of assets due to impairment was required in capital expenditures teco energy s capital expenditures of million consisted of million for tampa electric  which included million of afudc  and million for the diversified companies 
tampa electric spent million in on construction of the polk power station  a megawatt coal gasification plant which entered commercial service late in the third quarter 
the capital cost of the plant to tampa electric including afudc was million  which is net of the construction funding from the department of energy under its clean coal technology program 
tampa electric spent an additional million in for equipment and facilities to meet its growing customer base and for generating equipment improvements 
teco transport trade invested million in for the purchase of a  ton ship  jumbo river barges  a program of b a rge enlargement and refurbishment  and for normal equipment replacement 
teco coalbed methane invested million in for well enhancements and normal equipment replacement 
teco coal spent million for an expansion of its clintwood operations and new mining equipment 
teco power services spent million to increase its ownership interest in the alborada power station in guatemala from percent to percent and for initial design work for the san jose power station in guatemala 
teco oil gas invested million for natural gas exploration and development 
teco energy estimates total capital expenditures for ongoing operations to be million for and million during the period 
of these amounts  tampa electric expects to spend million in and million during the period  mainly for distribution facilities to meet customer growth and generation reliability programs 
at the end of  tampa electric had outstanding commitments of about million for capital programs 
tampa electric s capital expenditure projections include about million over the period to comply with phase ii of the clean air act as described in the environmental compliance section 
the level of capital expenditures which will actually be required for compliance is uncertain at this time 
the diversified companies expect capital expenditures of about million in and million during the period for a new coal preparation plant at clintwood  other coal mining equipment and mine development  exploration and production of oil and gas  acquisition of river barges and ocean transportation equipment  and normal asset replacement 
at the end of  million had been committed 
included in these estimates is million at teco power services for the construction of the san jose power station in guatemala over the next three years 
teco power services is seeking debt financing for the remainder of its share of the construction costs 
capital requirements for peoples gas system and peoples gas company are not reflected in the above projections 
in recent years  the capital invested by these companies was about million annually 
capital expenditures are expected to be above historical levels as opportunities to grow these business are identified 
however  since the capital investment plans for these companies are still being developed  the actual level of investment is uncertain 
environmental compliance teco energy and its subsidiaries are subject to various environmental regulations 
teco energy believes that all subsidiaries are substantially in compliance with the currently applicable standards of the respective environmental enforcement agencies and that potential environmental liabilities are not material 
tampa electric is complying with the phase i emission limitations imposed by the clean air act amendments which became effective jan 
 by using blends of lower sulfur coal  controlling stack emissions and owning emission allowances 
in tampa electric successfully integrated big bend unit three into the existing scrubber on big bend unit four 
this resulted in an additional scrubbed unit at a fraction of the cost of a new scrubber 
tampa electric is currently evaluating options to comply with phase ii sulfur dioxide emission standards set for the year the o p tions include scrubbing additional capacity 
the company is evaluating equipment and technologies to accomplish compliance in the most cost effective manner 
tampa electric is also evaluating options to comply with phase ii of the clean air act amendments for nitrogen oxide reductions 
these options include combustion modifications and r e trofit control technology 
while tampa electric s estimates reflected in the capital expenditure section include up to million for compliance with phase ii of the clean air act amendments  the actual level of required expenditures is uncertain at this time 
the cost of compliance with phase ii is expected to have little impact on tampa electric s prices 
utility regulation return on equity roe and other regulatory agreements in march the fpsc issued an order which changed tampa electric s authorized roe to an percent midpoint with a range of percent to percent  while leaving in effect the rates it had previously established 
the fpsc also ordered a million annual accrual to establish an unfunded storm damage reserve for transmission and distribution property 
in july the fpsc issued an order approving an agreement between its staff and tampa electric to cap the utility s authorized regulatory roe at percent for calendar year with any earnings above that amount to be used to increase the storm damage reserve 
tampa electric did not exceed the percent cap in and therefore accrued only million to the storm damage reserve 
rate stabilization strategy building on the approach  tampa electric s objective has been to place the polk power station in service without increasing the total price for electric service while securing the opportunity to earn a fair return 
a number of actions  discussed in the tampa electric operating expenses section  were taken to manage costs 
another key component of the strategy to accomplish this objective has been the deferral of certain revenues 
with the agreements approved by the fpsc in and  the objectives of stabilizing prices through and securing fair earnings opportunities during this period were accomplished 
in the fpsc approved a plan submitted by tampa electric to defer certain revenues for under this plan tampa electric s allowed roe increased to an percent midpoint with a range of percent to percent 
for an initial million of revenues were deferred as well as percent of actual revenues in excess of a roe of percent up to a net earned roe of percent and all actual revenues above a roe of percent 
in tampa electric deferred million of revenues under this plan 
the deferred revenues accrue interest at the day commercial paper rate specified in the florida administrative code 
also as part of this plan tampa electric s oil backout tariff was eliminated jan 
  an annual revenue reduction of about million 
in may the fpsc issued an order approving an agreement among tampa electric  the florida office of public counsel opc and the florida industrial power users group fipug on a multi year base rate freeze and refund plan 
under this plan  base rates were frozen through and tampa electric s customers began receiving a million refund starting in october over a month period 
the refund consists of million of revenues deferred from and million of revenues 
in addition  the agreement set forth a multi year plan for allocating revenues based on tampa electric s roe 
for the years through tampa electric retains all revenues contributing to a roe up to percent 
any additional revenues will be allocated according to a formula 
in  percent of any actual revenues contributing to a roe in excess of percent were included in revenues 
the remaining percent were deferred for use in and under this allocation million of revenues were deferred 
about million of revenues deferred from and  after the effect of the million refund are available for use in and it is expected that tampa electric will recognize million to million of previously deferred revenues in in percent of any revenues that contribute to a roe in excess of percent up to percent will be included in revenues 
the remaining percent will be deferred for use in as will any revenues contributing to a roe in excess of percent 
the same percent allocation will be made in after taking into account any deferred revenues not used in previous years 
the remaining percent  as well as any revenues contributing to a roe in excess of percent will be refunded to customers in in october the fpsc unanimously approved an agreement among tampa electric  opc and fipug that resolved all pending regulatory issues associated with the polk power station 
the agreement allows the full recovery of all of the expected capital costs  and operations and maintenance expenses associated with the polk power station 
the agreement also calls for an extension of the base rate freeze established in the may agreement through tampa electric has the option of filing an application with the fpsc on or after july  for authorization to adjust base rates after jan 
 under the october agreement  the million refund established in the may agreement remains intact and  in addition  customers will receive a million temporary base rate reduction to be reflected as a credit on customer bills over a month period beginning oct 
 this temporary base rate reduction will be netted against any refunds that otherwise might have been made in under the may agreement 
the october agreement closely parallels the roe formula in the may agreement 
in  percent of the revenues contributing to a roe in excess of percent will be refunded to customers in along with any revenues which contribute to a roe above percent 
tampa electric agreed to remove from rate base the million investment made in land at port manatee 
this land has value for uses other than as a power plant site  and will continue to be recorded as an asset of tampa electric 
a citizens task force recommended using previously mined land in polk county over the manatee site as the preferred location for the polk power station 
environmental cost recovery clause in august the fpsc approved the recovery of million of tampa electric s environmental compliance costs through the environmental cost recovery clause 
these are new costs incurred by tampa electric to comply with environmental regulations enacted subsequent to its most recent full regulatory price setting proceeding but not included in current rates 
tampa electric plans to seek continuing recovery of these types of costs through this clause until the next full regulatory price setting proceeding 
under the october agreement the earliest any such new prices could be in effect is in the year utility competition tampa electric s retail business is substantially free from direct competition with other electric utilities  municipalities and public agencies 
at the present time  the principal form of competition at the retail level consists of natural gas for residences and businesses and the self generation option available to larger users of electric e n ergy 
such users may seek to expand their options through l e g i s lative and or regulatory initiatives that would permit competition at the retail level 
tampa electric intends to take all appropriate actions to retain and expand its retail business  including managing costs  and providing high quality service to retail customers 
such action could  with the approval of the fpsc  include the use of load retention and or economic development service contracts and tariffs to reduce the loss of existing load and or acquire additional load 
see the description of the imc agrico request for proposals in tampa electric s operating revenues section 
there is presently active competition in the wholesale power markets in florida  and this is increasing largely as a result of the energy policy act of and related federal initiatives 
this act removed certain regulatory barriers to independent power producers and required utilities to transmit power from such producers  utilities and others to wholesale customers as more fully described below 
tampa electric continues its cost reduction efforts to increase its wholesale business  which is dependent on access to transmission systems owned by others 
in april the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued its final rule on open access non discriminatory transmission  stranded costs  open access same time information system oasis and standards of conduct 
these rules work together to open access for wholesale power flows on transmission systems 
utilities owning transmission facilities including tampa electric are required to provide services to wholesale transmission customers comparable to those they provide to themselves on comparable terms and conditions including price 
among other things  the rules require transmission services to be unbundled from power sales and owners of transmission systems must take transmission service under their own transmission tariffs 
transmission system owners are also required to implement an oasis system providing  via the internet  access to transmission service i n f o rmation including price and availability  and to rely exclusively on their own oasis system for such information for purposes of their own wholesale power transactions 
to facilitate compliance  owners must implement standards of conduct to ensure that personnel involved in marketing of wholesale power are functionally separated from personnel involved in transmission services and reliability functions 
tampa electric  together with other utilities  has implemented an oasis system and believes it is in compliance with the standards of conduct 
ferc proceedings in july ferc s final rule on open access mandated that all public utilities file transmission service tariffs with terms and conditions that conform with ferc s pro forma tariffs 
tampa electric received interventions and protests from various parties to the implementing tariffs it filed 
on jan 
  ferc ordered minor revisions in the terms and conditions of these tariffs 
the rates proposed by tampa electric had previously become effective on july   subject to refund 
tampa electric has intervened and protested the rates filed by florida power and light company and florida power corporation

based upon anticipated revenue growth and effective cost management in all of its businesses  dividend payout levels and identified capital expenditures  teco energy expects to generate between million and million of free cash flow through the year this would be available to further grow the business and strengthen the balance sheet 
investment considerations the following are certain of the factors which could affect teco energy s future results 
they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward looking statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this report and otherwise made by or on the behalf of teco energy since these factors  among others  could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements 
general economic conditions 
the company s businesses are dependent on general economic conditions 
in particular  the projected growth in tampa electric s service area is important to the realization of tampa electric s forecasts for annual energy sales growth for and beyond 
an unanticipated downturn in the area s economy could adversely affect tampa electric s performance through time 
the activities of the diversified businesses  particularly teco transport trade and teco coal  are also affected by general economic conditions in the respective industries and geographic areas they serve both nationally and internationally 
weather variations 
most of teco energy s businesses are affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather 
tampa electric s energy sales are particularly sensitive to variations in weather conditions 
it forecasts energy sales on the basis of normal weather  which represents a long term historical average 
significant variations from normal weather could have a material impact on energy sales 
unusual weather  such as hurricanes  could also have an effect on operating costs as well as sales 
variations in weather conditions also affect the demand and prices for the commodities sold by teco coalbed methane  teco oil gas and teco coal 
teco transport trade is also impacted by weather because of its effects on the supply of and demand for the products transported 
severe weather conditions that could interrupt or slow service and increase operating costs also affects each of these businesses 
potential competitive changes 
the electric industry has been undergoing certain restructuring 
competition in wholesale power sales has been introduced on a national level 
some states have mandated or encouraged competition at the retail level 
while there is active wholesale competition in florida  the retail electric business has remained substantially free from direct competition 
changes in the competitive environment occasioned by legislation  regulation or market conditions  however  particularly with respect to retail competition  could adversely affect tampa electric s business and its performance 
regulatory actions 
tampa electric operates in a highly regulated industry 
its retail operations  including the prices it charges  are regulated by the fpsc  and its wholesale power sales and transmission services are subject to regulation by ferc 
changes in regulatory requirements or adverse regulatory actions could have an adverse affect on tampa electric s performance 
commodity price changes 
most of teco energy s businesses are sensitive to changes in certain commodity prices 
such changes could affect the prices they charge  their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services 
in the case of tampa electric  fuel costs used for generation are mostly affected by the cost of coal 
tampa electric is able to pass the cost of fuel through to retail customers  but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and therefore the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources 
on the wholesale side  the ability to make sales and the margins on power sales are affected by the cost of coal to tampa electric  particularly as it relates to the cost of gas and oil to other power producers 
at the diversified companies  changes in gas and coal prices directly affect the margins at teco oil gas  teco coalbed methane and teco coal 
environmental matters 
teco energy s businesses are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities dealing with air  water and other environmental matters 
changes in and compliance with these regulations may impose additional costs on the company  or result in the curtailment of certain activities
