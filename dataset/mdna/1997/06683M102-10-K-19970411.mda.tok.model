the trust s objective is to provide cash distributions to its shareholders from cash generated from the trust s operations

due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies  the real estate investment trust reit industry has adopted a standard which it believes more accurately reflects operating property performance 
funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  less extraordinary unusual and nonrecurring items  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures in which the reit holds an interest 
the trust cautions shareholders that the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity and as such the presentation of ffo by the trust may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reporting companies 
ffo is not intended to be a measure of the cash generated by a reit nor the reit s capacity to pay distributions 
however  a reit s distribution can be analyzed in comparison to ffo in a similar manner as a company that is not a reit would compare its distribution to net operating income 
for the years ended december    and  the trust s operations generated ffo of million  million and million  respectively 
ffo increased for the year ended december  as compared to the years ended december  and as a result of the trust s   and property acquisitions 
ffo for the years ended december    and is calculated as follows net income loss    plus depreciation expense    depreciation included in operations of real estate ventures    lease commission amortization    less minority interest share of depreci ation expense    minority interest share of lease commission amortization    recovery of losses on loans  notes and interest receivable    franchise tax fees accrued   valuation allowance included in operations of real estate venture   gain on disposition of investment in real estate venture  funds from operations    the trust expects to fund its future liquidity needs with the cash flow obtained from its operating properties  cash proceeds derived from mortgage financing either on a long term basis or utilizing the amended line secured by the trust s remaining unencumbered properties colonial penn  phoenix business park  lexington and newtown properties  sale of the h street assemblage property and interest earned on the trust s short term investments

factors affecting the trust s business plan general factors affecting share price 
the market price of the shares may fluctuate in response to a variety of factors  including but not limited to i variations in the trust s quarterly operating results including changes in ffo  ii the gain or loss of tenants at trust properties  iii general risks  changes or trends in the real estate industry  iv increased competition with other entities or persons engaged in the same business  v legislative or regulatory changes  and vi a change in management of the trust 
in addition  the stock market has in the past experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of securities of companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the shares 
factors affecting operating results 
in addition to the factors discussed above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  other factors may affect the trust s liquidity and capital resources as well as results of operations including but not limited to i the trust s ability to secure mortgage financing for its lexington and newtown properties on terms acceptable to the trust  ii delays in the sale of  or the inability to sell  the h street assemblage  iii the trust s ability to deploy cash available for investment in operating properties generating yields greater than the interest rate paid by the trust on its indebtedness  iv the continued occupancy by  and the financial solvency of  the major tenants at the trust s colonial penn  florida power and light  woodcrest office park and riverport drive properties  v ability to re lease space as leases expire on terms at least as favorable as the terms of existing leases since approximately of the tenant leases at the trust s properties are scheduled to expire in  and vi market conditions and rental rates where the trust s properties are located 
general real estate investment risks 
real property investments are subject to certain risks that may not always be predicted or controlled 
the cash flow generated by  and capital appreciation realized from  real property investments may be adversely affected by the national and regional economic climate which  in turn  may be adversely impacted by plant closings  industry slow downs  income tax rates  interest rates  demographic changes and other factors  local real estate conditions such as oversupply of  or reduced demand for rental space in the area  the attractiveness of the properties  zoning and other regulatory restrictions  competition from other land developers or developments  increased operating costs including maintenance costs  insurance premiums and real estate taxes  perceptions by tenants or potential buyers of the safety  convenience and attractiveness of the property and the willingness of the owner of the property to provide capable management and adequate maintenance 
in light of the foregoing factors  there can be no assurance that the cash flow generated by  and capital appreciation realized from  the trust s properties will be sufficient to cover expenses or recover costs 
the cash flow generated by  or capital appreciation from  real property investments may also be adversely affected by changes in governmental regulations  zoning or tax laws  potential environmental or other legal liabilities and changes in interest rates 
real estate investments are also relatively illiquid 
therefore  the trust s ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions is limited  which may result in losses if the trust is forced to sell a property 
risks associated with the recent acquisition of many of the properties  lack of operating history 
the trust acquired all of its properties within the last five years  and acquired eight of its properties since june the most recently acquired properties may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to the trust that may impact their value or revenue potential 
it is also possible that the operating performance of the most recently acquired properties may decline under the trust s management 
the trust is currently experiencing a period of rapid growth 
as the trust acquires additional properties  the trust will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties  including lease up and tenant retention 
in addition  the trust s ability to manage its growth effectively will require it to successfully integrate its new acquisitions into its existing management structure 
no assurances can be given that the trust will be able to successfully integrate such properties or effectively manage additional properties  or that newly acquired properties will perform as expected 
potential inability to repay or refinance indebtedness at maturity 
the trust is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that the trust s cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  the risk that any indebtedness will not be able to be refinanced or that the terms of any such refinancing will be less favorable than the terms of the expiring indebtedness 
the trust anticipates that scheduled principal payments due in connection with the trust s indebtedness will total approximately  and million for the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
potential effect of rising interest rates on trust s variable rate debt 
advances under the modified line bear interest at variable rates and the interest rate payable on bonds issued for the benefit of the trust are subject to periodic adjustments based on the then current market interest rates 
in addition  the trust may incur other variable rate indebtedness in the future 
increases in interest rates on such indebtedness would increase the trust s interest expense  which could adversely affect the trust s financial condition and results of operations 
see liquidity and capital resources above 
concentration of tenants at significant properties 
at each of the trust s colonial penn  florida power and light  woodcrest office park and riverport drive properties  one or two tenants occupy all or a substantial majority of the leased space 
if one or more of the tenants at these properties were to default on its lease or file for bankruptcy or reorganization  the trust s revenues could be reduced  particularly if the trust were unable to re lease the vacant space on comparable terms and conditions 
therefore  the bankruptcy or default by one of these tenants could have an adverse effect on the trust s financial condition and results of operations 
competition for tenants 
the trust competes with numerous other entities in attracting tenants to lease its space 
some of the competing properties may be newer  better located or owned by parties better capitalized than the trust 
an increase in the number of competitive properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on i the ability to lease space in the properties or in newly acquired or developed properties  and ii the rents charged 
competition in acquiring property 
in seeking to acquire additional property  the trust competes with many other entities  some of which have greater financial and managerial resources than the trust 
there can be no assurance that the trust will be able to acquire additional properties on terms and conditions which are consistent with the trust s business plan  if at all 
restrictions on re leasing space 
tenant leases often grant tenants the exclusive right to sell certain types of merchandise or provide certain types of services within a property  or limit other tenants right to sell such merchandise or provide such services 
certain leases at northlake tower shopping center contain these types of restrictions  which may limit the number and types of prospective tenants for vacant space at this property 
substantial debt obligations 
as of december   the trust s indebtedness aggregated approximately million and the ratio of debt to net assets for the trust was 
the trust s ability to service its debts and other obligations when they become due depends on  among other things  the trust s ability to secure additional capital and the properties ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet the trust s cash needs for operating expenses and debt service payments 
certain expenditures  such as loan payments and real estate taxes  are not necessarily decreased by events adversely affecting revenues or expenses at the property level 
if the trust fails to make required payments on its indebtedness  the trust could lose the property securing these obligations  which would have a material adverse effect on the trust s financial condition and results of operations 
adverse consequences of failure to qualify as a reit tax liabilities as a consequence of failure to qualify as a reit 
the trust has elected to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the code  and the trust believes that it has been organized and has operated in such a manner so as to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
although the trust believes that it will remain organized and will continue to operate so as the qualify as a reit  no assurance can be given that the trust has so qualified or will be able to remain so qualified 
qualifica tion as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements in certain instances  on an annual and quarterly basis set forth in highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations  and may be affected by various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the trust s control 
in the case of a reit  such as the trust  that holds a substantial portion of its assets in partnership form  the complexity of these code provisions and the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated thereunder is even greater 
further  no assurance can be given that future legislation  new treasury regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
the trust  however  is not aware of any pending proposal to amend the tax laws that would materially and adversely affect its ability to operate in such a manner so as to qualify as a reit 
if the trust were to fail to qualify as a reit with respect to any taxable year  the trust would not be allowed a deduction in computing its taxable income from amounts distributed to its stockholders  and would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
as a result  any net earnings of the trust available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be reduced for the year or years involved because of the trust s additional tax liability  and distributions to stockholders would no longer be required to be made 
moreover  unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  the trust would also be ineligible for qualification as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which such qualification was lost 
although the trust believes it has operated and currently intends to operate in a manner designed to allow it to continue to qualify as a reit  future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause it to determine that it is in the best interests of the trust and its stockholders to revoke the reit election 
effect of reit distribution requirements 
to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the trust generally will be required each year to distribute to its stockholders at least of its taxable income excluding any net capital gain and after certain adjustments 
in addition  the trust will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which certain distributions paid by it with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of of its ordinary income for such year plus of its capital gain net income for such year plus of its undistributed income from prior taxable years 
the trust intends to make distributions to its stockholders to comply with the distribution requirement of the code and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax described above 
the trust anticipates that cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to enable it to pay its operating expenses and meet the distribution requirements of a reit  but no assurances can be given that this will be the case 
in addition  differences in timing between i the actual receipt of income and the actual payments of expenses  and ii the inclusion of such income and the deduction of such expenses in arriving at taxable income of the trust could leave the trust without sufficient cash to enable it to meet the reit distribution requirements 
accordingly  the trust could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms to comply with such requirements 
the requirement to distribute a substantial portion of the trust s taxable income could also cause the trust to have to distribute amounts that would otherwise be spent on future acquisitions  unanticipated capital expenditures or repayment of debt  which would require additional borrowings or sales of assets to fund the costs of such items and could restrict the trust s ability to expand at a pace necessary to remain competitive 
finite life of the trust 
the trust is a finite life entity 
under the declaration of trust  the trustees are required to use reasonable efforts to terminate the trust by october   provided that the trustees are required to determine in good faith that the termination is in the shareholders best interest 
unless the declaration of trust is amended to either extend the termination date or to eliminate the termination date entirely  the trust i may be unable to obtain capital  either debt or equity or renew existing financing on terms and conditions acceptable to the trust  if at all  ii may be forced soon after the termination date to liquidate properties at prices below those which might prevail if the trust was not forced to liquidate its portfolio 
any of these factors could have an adverse effect on the trust s financial condition and results of operations 
potential increases in certain taxes and regulatory compliance costs 
increases in income  service or transfer taxes are generally not passed through to tenants under leases and may  therefore  adversely affect the trust s cash flow and its ability to make distributions to stockholders 
the trust s properties are also subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements  such as those imposed by the americans with disabilities act the ada  which require all public accommodations and commercial facilities to meet certain federal standards related to access and use by disabled persons  and state and local fire and life safety standards 
failing to comply with the ada could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or an award of damages to private litigants 
the trust believes that its existing properties are in substantial compliance with these regulatory requirements 
however  existing statutes or rules may be amended or new statutes or rules may be adopted  each of which may have an adverse effect on the trust s financial condition and results of operations 
possible environmental liabilities 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs that these parties incur in connection with the contamination 
these laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants  and the liability under these laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocating responsibility 
the costs of investigating  remediating or removing substances may be substantial  and the presence of these substances  or the failure to properly remediate the contamination on a property  may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent the property or to borrow using the property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility also may be liable for the costs of removing or remediating a release of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the person owns or operates the facility 
in addition  some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs incurred in connection with the contamination 
finally  the owner of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from such site 
the trust is not aware of any environmental liability that the trust believes would have a material adverse effect on the trust s business  assets or results of operations taken as a whole 
there can be no assurance  however  that the trust would have knowledge of all conditions giving rise to potential environmental liabilities subsequent to its acquisition of a property since the trust has ordered phase i environmental assessments only as part of its acquisition due diligence for each of its properties and has only ordered phase ii environmental assessments in limited circumstances when necessitated 
moreover  there can be no assurance that i future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability  or ii the current environmental condition of the trust s properties will not be affected by tenants  by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the trust s properties such as the presence of underground storage tanks  or by third parties unrelated to the trust 
any expenditures associated with environmental liabilities of the trust could have an adverse effect on the trust s financial condition and results of operations
