see recent developments 
the acquisition positioned fidelity national financial  inc as the nation s fourth largest title insurance underwriter 
nations title inc and its three wholly owned underwriting subsidiaries  nations title insurance company  nations title insurance of new york inc and national title insurance of new york inc  expanded the company s national agency network and increased its market share in the more traditional agency driven states 
the nations title inc acquisition resulted in additional agency business and a shift in the mix of business from direct to agency during the revenue and expense information presented in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes nations title inc s results of operations for the nine month period ended december  in  the total title related revenue excluding interest and investment income and non title related other fees and revenue generated by agency operations increased to from in during and  and  respectively  of total title related revenue was generated from direct operations 
the company traditionally focused on direct operations because it retains the entire premium from each transaction and is able to generate additional sources of revenue by providing other title related services 
the fluctuation in the percentage of revenue generated by direct operations versus the percentage of revenue generated by agency operations between and is due to several factors 
during  the company terminated a number of agency relationships based on the company s agent retention criteria 
the company continually monitors agency relationships for quality and productivity 
audits of agents are conducted on a periodic basis  and agents which do not meet the company s standards are not retained 
in addition  during  the company acquired certain former agents which were converted to direct operations 
the company s strategy of expanding into selected markets continued during the last three years

results of operations revenue 
the following table presents information regarding the components of the company s revenue years ended december  dollars in thousands  other than fee per file title insurance premiums    escrow fees    other fees and revenue    interest and investment income  including    realized gains losses total revenue    orders closed by direct operations    average fee per file from direct operations favorable mortgage interest rates in the latter part of through early triggered refinancing activity at record levels 
beginning in early through mid  steady interest rate increases caused by actions taken by the federal reserve board resulted in a significant decline in refinancing transactions and a stagnation in residential resales and new home sales 
title orders and requests for title related services followed the market trend as expected 
since late  decreases in mortgage interest rates and the resulting improvement in the real estate market have had a positive impact on the level of real estate activity 
these factors and the company s acquisition of nations title inc  which was completed on april   have resulted in title premiums of million  million and million  for  and  respectively 
the difference in title insurance premiums between and of million represents an increase of 
title insurance premiums decreased million  or  in from the average fee per file increased to in from in  which had previously increased from in the increase in fee per file in over is the result of increased fee revenue attributable to higher fees charged per policy due to appreciated property values  an overall rate increase and an expansion in the commercial business sector offset by an increase in refinancing transactions 
the increase in over can be attributed to the change in the mix of business from refinance to resale 
as mortgage interest rates increased due to the actions taken by the federal reserve board  the refinancing trend ended 
thus  title business that was generated was primarily related to new home sale or resale transactions  which typically charge higher fees than refinancing transactions 
fees generated from refinancing transactions are generally less than fees generated from resale transactions because the base rate charged on such a policy is usually lower 
furthermore  one policy is issued to a lender in a refinance transaction and two policies are issued in a resale transaction buyer and lender 
the company s direct operations generate escrow fees from holding funds and documents in connection with the closing of real estate transactions  as well as other fees and revenue 
other fees and revenue primarily include document preparation fees  reconveyance fees  real estate information and technology fees  foreclosure publishing and posting fees and exchange intermediary fees received

escrow fees have fluctuated during the  and years in a pattern generally consistent with the fluctuation in title insurance premiums 
escrow fees increased million to million in  a increase from million in the percentage increase in escrow fees is not as significant as the percentage increase in title premiums due to the change in the direct operation agency business mix 
see overview 
escrow fees decreased million  or  in from to million from million 
the decrease in escrow fees in from is not as great as the decrease in title insurance premiums due to the decrease in agency title insurance premiums as a percentage of total title related revenue 
agency title insurance premiums do not generate escrow fees for the company 
other fees and revenue trend closely with the level and mix of business  as well as the performance of certain of the company s title related subsidiaries 
in  other fees and revenue increased million  or  to million from million in the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in title premiums and escrow fees generated by the company s direct operations 
direct operations generate other fees and income 
additionally  the company s foreclosure publishing and posting business  exchange intermediary service and appraisal service have significantly expanded their market presence and revenue  which are included in other fees and income 
other fees and revenue were generated at comparable levels in and  primarily as a result of the type of business in  which was primarily resale business  and the direct operation agency business mix 
during  other fees and revenue decreased million  or  to million from million in thus  even in a year when overall title revenue may be down  the level of other fees and revenue can be maintained  depending on the direct operation agency business mix 
the consistency between the and years is primarily attributable to the nature of the revenue included and the title insurance market environment which shifted from a refinance to a resale oriented market 
in a resale transaction  other fees and revenue are greater than in a refinancing transaction

interest and investment income levels are primarily a function of securities markets  interest rates and the amount of cash available for investment

personnel costs totalled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see overview and revenue 
personnel costs  as a percentage of total revenue  have decreased to in from in  which had previously increased from in these fluctuations in personnel costs as a percentage of total revenue can be attributed to the varying market conditions in the title insurance industry and the mix of agency versus direct business

the company continues to be committed to these cost control measures 
total other operating expenses totalled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
see overview 
the period over period fluctuations in personnel costs and other operating expenses are primarily the result of the fluctuations in total revenue  as well as the changes in the direct operation and agency operation title premium mix

the increase in agent commissions as a percentage of agency premiums over  resulting in a decrease in the percentage of agency premiums retained by the company  is attributable to the fact that the average commissions paid to agents acquired in the nations title inc acquisition exceed those paid to the former agent base 
the combination of higher agency commission rates and the significant agency revenue generated by the nations title inc acquisition have resulted in higher overall commissions in the percentage of agency premiums retained by the company increased in over primarily due to the company s expansion of operations outside of california into states where underwriters retained premiums are generally greater 
the provision for claim losses includes an estimate of anticipated title claims and major claims 
the estimate of anticipated title claims is accrued as a percentage of title premium revenue based on the company s historical loss experience and other relevant factors 
the company monitors its claims experience on a continual basis and adjusts the provision for claim losses accordingly 
based on company loss development studies  the company believes that as a result of its underwriting and claims handling practices  as well as the refinancing business of prior years  the company will maintain the trend of favorable claim loss experience 
based on this information  in  and  the company recorded a provision for claim losses of of title insurance premiums prior to major claim expense  net of recoupments and the impact of premium rates and company loss experience in the state of texas 
premiums are generally higher in texas for similar coverage than in other states  while loss experience is comparable 
as a result  losses as a percentage of premiums are lower 
these factors resulted in a net provision for claim losses of  and in  and  respectively

statement requires that under certain conditions entities perform separate calculations for assets to be held and used to determine whether recognition of an impairment loss is required and  if so  to measure the impairment 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the asset s carrying amount  an impairment loss is considered  if the sum of the expected future cash flows is more than the asset s carrying amount  an impairment loss cannot be recognized 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
statement requires long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of to be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  except for assets covered by the provisions of accounting pronouncements board opinion no 
statement was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of statement did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
statement  accounting for stock based compensation  was issued by the financial accounting standards board in october statement applies to all transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services by issuing instruments or by incurring liabilities where the payment amounts are based on the entity s common stock price  except for employee stock ownership plans esops 
statement covers transactions with employees and non employees and is applicable to both public and non public entities 
statement establishes a new method of accounting for stock based compensation arrangements with employees 
the new method is a fair value method rather than the intrinsic value method that is contained in accounting pronouncements board opinion no 
opinion 
however  the statement does not require an entity to adopt the new fair value based method for purposes of preparing its basic financial statements 
entities are allowed to continue to use the opinion method or to adopt the statement fair value based method 
once the fair value based method is adopted  an entity cannot change back to the opinion method 
also  the selected method applies to all of an entity s compensation plans and transactions 
the statement fair value based method will result in higher compensation cost than the opinion intrinsic value based method for fixed stock option compensation plans and will result in a different compensation cost for variable stock option compensation plans 
sometimes the amount will be higher and sometimes the amount will be lower 
also  many employee stock purchase plans that are considered noncompensatory under opinion will be compensatory and result in the recognition of compensation costs under the fair value based method 
for entities not adopting the statement fair value based method  the statement creates a unique financial reporting situation 
it requires entities that retain the opinion method for preparing their basic financial statements to display in the footnotes pro forma net income and earnings per share information as if the fair value based method had been adopted 
thus  these entities are required to account for employee compensation arrangements by two different methods and must present two separate measures of results of operations 
statement was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has chosen to continue using the opinion method when accounting for stock based compensation in its basic financial statements

per share which will be payable on may   to stockholders of record on april  seasonality 
historically  the greatest volume of residential resale activity has occurred in the spring and summer months 
however  events during the past five years  including numerous actions taken by the federal reserve board  have caused unusual fluctuations in real estate activity  particularly in the seasonal pattern of residential resale and refinance activity 
the company cannot predict whether the historical pattern of residential resale and refinance activity will continue to be affected by such outside factors 
inflation 
to the extent real estate prices or mortgage interest rates increase due to inflationary factors  the company s title insurance premium revenue generally increases because premiums are determined in part by the value of property or the amount of the mortgage loan 
the company s personnel costs and other operating expenses are also sensitive to inflation
