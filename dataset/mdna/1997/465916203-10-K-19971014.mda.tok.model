item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is engaged in the business of designing  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and servicing specialty theatre systems which employ a variety of projection  show control  ride simulation and software technologies 
the company is currently in the business of a selling and installing ride simulation attractions in specialty theatres  b selling and installing giant screen theatres generally such theatres require projection technology which utilizes film sizes ranging between five perforations per frame by millimeters and fifteen perforations per frame by millimeter  c licensing and distributing the films in its library to ride simulation theatres previously sold by the company  d producing films in the  and film format for its film library as well as producing films in these formats for third parties  e investing in joint ventures by contributing its ride simulation technology  design and equipment and participating in the theatres profits  and f operating a fleet of mobile ride simulation attractions which it owns 
in addition  during march  the company acquired the technology and patents for a state of the art movie projector which iwerks uses to manufacture and sell projectors used primarily on theatres systems designed by iwerks 
the selling and installation of both ride simulation theatres and large screen theatres includes providing all or part of the design of such theatres  sale of the projector screens  show control systems  motion simulators and sound systems 
recent developments on march  two newly formed wholly owned subsidiaries of iwerks acquired all the stock of pioneer in exchange for  shares of iwerks common stock 
concurrently  the company purchased a patent from a partnership related to pioneer for approximately  in cash 
these transactions were accounted for as a purchase with an aggregate purchase price of approximately  including acquisition costs 
the aggregate purchase price of pioneer in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets of pioneer at the date of acquisition was  which has been allocated to goodwill 
the operations of pioneer have been consolidated with the operations of the company from march on august  the company and showscan announced they signed a definitive agreement to merge 
the combined company  which will bring together the two largest ride simulation companies  will be the largest provider of ride simulation entertainment attractions and software in the world 
the transaction calls for each share of showscan common stock to be converted into of a share of iwerks common stock 
the showscan preferred stock will be exchanged for iwerks common stock at the ratio on an as converted basis 
iwerks expects to issue approximately million shares of iwerks common stock in the merger excluding shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding showscan options and warrants and the notes  resulting in an estimated transaction value of approximately million based upon a closing price of iwerks common stock on the nasdaq national market on august  of per share 
the transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests  after which showscan will become a wholly owned subsidiary of iwerks 
consummation of the merger is subject to approval by the stockholders of the company and showscan  as well as other customary closing conditions 
if shareholder approval is not obtained or other closing conditions are not satisfied or if the parties mutually agree to terminate or modify the terms of the merger agreement  the transaction may not be consummated pursuant to the existing terms of the merger agreement  or at all 
the stockholders meetings are scheduled to take place in the fourth calendar quarter of the company anticipates incurring approximately million of transaction expenses related to the merger in the first and second fiscal quarter of these include investment banking  legal  accounting  printing  severance  expenses for consolidation of facilities and other expenses  some of which will be incurred even if the merger is not consummated 
these factors plus the seasonality of the mobile simulation portion of the business and a reduction in hardware contracts in fiscal are expected to result in the combined company having losses in the first two quarters of fiscal results of operations the company derives its revenues primarily from three sources sales of hardware systems  owned and operated primarily portable simulation theatres  and licensing of films 
to a lesser extent  revenues are also earned from service to existing theatre owners and production of films for third parties 
revenues for the fiscal year ended june   and are analyzed in the following table in thousands fiscal year ended june hardware sales service    owned and operated    film licensing    film production and other   revenues on sales of theatre systems are recognized on the percentage of completion method over the life of the contract 
accordingly  the timing of shipment schedules as dictated by the customer can result in variability of quarterly revenues and earnings 
the gross margin for each contract varies based upon pricing strategies  competitive conditions and product mix 
revenues from owned and operated o o consist of portable ride simulation theatre revenues derived primarily from corporate sponsorship or ticket sales at state fairs  air shows  and similar events  as well as revenues derived from fixed site joint venture revenues which includes iwerks s contractual share of the sites revenues or profits as applicable 
admission revenues from the portable ride simulation theatres are subject to variability due to the seasonal nature of these events and are higher during the summer months 
sponsorship and contract revenues for the portable theatres are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
the company typically licenses its film software under one year film license agreements 
revenues and related expenses are recognized at the beginning of the license period at which time the customer is billed the license fee and film is delivered to the customer 
the company recognizes revenues and costs associated with the production of custom films at the time of completion and acceptance by the customer 
accordingly  the timing of completion of custom films can result in substantial variability of quarterly revenues and gross margin 
the company typically realizes a smaller margin from the sale of custom films in comparison to its theatre system sales 
a significant portion of the company s sales are made to customers located outside of the united states  primarily in asia  canada  europe and south america 
revenues for the fiscal years ended june   and attributable to sales to these countries are analyzed in the following table in thousands percentage of percentage of percentage of total revenue total revenue total revenue asia    south america  including mexico europe    canada  total export revenues    iwerks expects the percentage of international sales to total sales will not likely fluctuate significantly in the next twelve months 
the company maintains an office in hong kong to support sales to asia 
a sales office was opened in london  england in may to support its european sales 
south american sales are supported out of the sarasota  florida office 
international operations and sales may be subject to political and economic risks  including political instability  currency fluctuations  changes in import export regulations  tariff and freight rates 
in addition  various forms of protectionist trade legislation have been proposed in the united states and in certain other countries 
any resulting change in current tariff structures or other trade and monetary policies could adversely affect iwerks international operations 
political and economic factors have been identified by the company with respect to certain markets in which it competes 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not result in customers of the company defaulting on payments due to iwerks  or in the reduction of potential purchases of the company s products 
typically  sales are denominated in united states dollars and are backed by letters of credit  which reduce the risks related to international sales 
comparison of year ended june  to year ended june  revenues revenue for the fiscal year ended june  decreased million or from the fiscal year revenue 
owned and operated revenue decreased million or  primarily from the company s touring ride simulators reactors  due primarily to the loss of a major sponsor at t corp 
in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  fiscal revenue included a million cancellation settlement for an event which was to be held at world expo in tokyo  japan and there were no such cancellation revenue in fiscal during the remaining portion of the fiscal year the company aggressively pursued new sponsorship opportunities and looked at other options to replace these revenues 
the loss of the major sponsor  that utilized of the reactors throughout fiscal  resulted in excess capacity between early fall and late spring of fiscal in june  one of the reactors was sold to a customer in korea and the company continues to actively seek alternatives to increase the utilization of the remaining reactors 
the million reduction in hardware sales and service resulted from a reduced number of hardware contracts in fiscal compared with fiscal film licensing revenue increased from fiscal to fiscal due primarily to an increase in the number of theaters which license films 
the decrease in film production and other was due to no films produced in fiscal compared to two films produced in fiscal cost of sales cost of sales primarily includes costs of theatre systems sold  expenses associated with operating portable ride simulation theatres  and costs associated with film production and licensing fees 
the cost of theatre systems include the cost of components  customization  engineering  project management  assembly  system integration and installation 
also included are royalties payable to a former joint venture partner and estimated warranty expenses 
the costs associated with film license fees primarily reflect amortization of film production costs over the lives of certain films and royalties paid to third parties 
the cost of sales associated with operating portable ride simulation theatres include costs for personnel  depreciation and amortization  event fees  fuel  insurance and maintenance 
the company s results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of theatre system shipments  the mix of theatre system contracts  the completion of custom film sales  the amount of revenue attributable to portable ride simulation theatres and film licensing agreements 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was and for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
one of the primary reasons for the decrease in the gross margins between fiscal and was due to million of charges to cost of sales made in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to changes in accounting estimates 
these included additional film amortization expense on films which have not achieved their projected revenue  additional reserve for disputes  increased warranty reserve  due to increased work performance on a contract  and a reduction of previously recognized earnings by  in connection with the cancellation of a contract 
in addition  the costs related to the revenue received from the cancellation settlement of the tokyo world expo in were nominal resulting in an unusually high margin in fiscal which did not occur in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include personnel costs  trade shows and other promotional expenses  sales commissions  travel expenses  public relations costs  amortization of goodwill  professional fees and divisional administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the million reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses between fiscal and was due primarily to reduced employee related compensation million  legal and accounting expenses million and travel and entertainment expenses million 
these reductions were partially offset by an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts million  increased research and development expenditures million  increased accrued expenses related to a regulatory audit million and expenses related to the proposed merger million

loss on impairment of assets due to the company being unable to replace the major sponsorship revenue from at t corp 
for its portable simulation theatre business and the resulting excess capacity this generated during the winter months as described above in the revenue section  the company recognized a non cash charge of million in fiscal primarily for its portable simulation theatres in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb release number  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the loss was calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the portable simulation theatres assets over the estimated future discounted cash flow from these theatres during the next six fiscal years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the impairment occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of disappointing results and an underutilization of reactors during the quarter  sponsorship and general admission events below expectations  and the lack of significant sponsorship backlog as of june  interest income expense interest income for fiscal and was million and million  respectively

comparison of year ended june  to year ended june  revenues revenue in fiscal increased compared with fiscal in all three primary revenue sources with a increase in hardware  a increase in owned and operated especially from foreign sources and a increase in film and other software licensing 
the revenue increase was partially offset by a decrease in film production 
the company had several custom film contracts in fiscal with no similar contracts in fiscal owned and operated o o revenues increased from to in fiscal  these revenues include foreign source revenues from taiwan  puerto rico and argentina 
the fleet of touring ride simulation theatres grew from at the close of fiscal to early in fiscal sponsorship events during fiscal year were primarily with one customer 
also  fiscal revenue included a million cancellation settlement for an event as mentioned previously 
film licensing revenues increased from to because of the increase in the number of film license agreements 
theatre hardware sales increased from to on increased demand for the company s theatre systems 
other revenues have various sources including exclusivity agreements  distribution rights  forfeited deposits and settlements on canceled contracts 
cost of sales the gross profit margin improved in fiscal compared to fiscal from to primarily because of the company s focus on hardware profit margins as well as attention to pricing and improved margins in o o  particularly in the portable theatre events where the margin was favorably impacted by cancellation fees associated with a canceled contract  which amounts were partially offset by costs incurred in anticipation of performance under the contract 
selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses were million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses from to resulted primarily from reduction in administrative costs associated with the closure of the sarasota  florida facility  and from the litigation costs  and bad debt charges  for which there were no comparable charges in interest income and expense interest income for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
this increase resulted primarily from changes in the invested cash balances during the respective periods

seasonality and fluctuating quarterly results the following tables set forth unaudited data regarding operations for each quarter of fiscal and and the percentage of the company s revenue and expenses represented by each item of the respective quarter 
this quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and  in management s opinion  contains all adjustments necessary to fairly state the information set forth herein 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
fiscal first second third fourth dollars in thousands quarter quarter quarter quarter revenue     cost of sales     gross margin     selling  general and administrative     loss on impairment of assets interest income expense  net income loss before provision for taxes   provision for taxes net income loss  fiscal first second third fourth dollars in thousands quarter quarter quarter quarter revenue     cost of sales     gross margin    selling  general and administrative     loss on impairment of assets  interest income expense  net income loss before provision for taxes  provision for taxes net income loss  the company s operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of theatre system shipments  the mix of theatre system contracts  the completion of custom film contracts and the amount of revenues from portable simulation theatre and film licensing agreements 
historically  the first and fourth fiscal quarters generates the lower quarterly revenue due to the seasonality of the portable simulation theater operations 
hardware sales will likely continue to experience inexplicable quarterly fluctuations as they are substantially dependent on the customers varying delivery and installation requirements 
over the last eight quarters  certain events have caused unusual fluctuations 
in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in the third quarter as performance compensation was accrued upon achieving a level of profitability  and revenues and profit margin were favorably impacted in the third quarter because of cancellation fees received in respect to a canceled contract 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  and planned expenditures are primarily based upon forecasts 
however  the sales cycle for the sale of a single attraction by the company typically ranges between six and eighteen months 
the company has little control over the timing of customer purchases 
in fiscal  the fourth quarter was impacted by the charge for the asset impairments of million as well as cost of sales expenses totaling million for additional film amortization expense on films which have not achieved their projected revenue  additional reserve for disputes  increased warranty reserve and a reduction of previously recognized earnings in connection with the cancellation of a contract 
also selling  general and administrative expenses increased in the fourth quarter due to an increase to bad debt reserve due to accounts which were deemed uncollectible  a legal reserve that first arose in the fourth quarter  increased accrual due to a regulatory audit and increased expenses relating to the proposed merger

the company has also received cash in the amount of million for the sale of certain distribution rights during the three fiscal years ending june  and proceeds from the financing of certain equipment purchases 
the company expects a significant portion between and of its sales in fiscal and will be from customers outside the united states  similar to the percentages of the past three fiscal years 
fluctuations in foreign currency in comparison to the us dollar will make the company s products either more or less costly to foreign customers than such sales have been in the past 
in fiscal  approximately million was provided by operating activities 
the company s major investing activities included investments in joint ventures for million  additions to film library of approximately million  acquisition of pioneer see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and related patent for million  and purchase of property and equipment for million 
financing activities included repayment of notes payable of million 
in fiscal  approximately million in cash was provided by operating activities  primarily from net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
offsetting these cash sources were increases in inventories and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million

in addition  the company has a million bank line of credit  none of which was drawn down at june  the company anticipates that its acquisition activities  operating and investment activities in fiscal and beyond  including expected investments in o o joint ventures will use cash and expects that its cash balance will decline 
if the merger is consummated  it is anticipated that the transaction fees associated with the merger which effect cash would be approximately million 
in addition  the company entered into an agreement to purchase three camera systems at a cost of million 
however  the company believes that its existing cash balances  the proceeds of the debt securities it owns as they mature  financing available from the company s million unused line of credit  and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through fiscal  after which time it may be required to raise additional cash through the sale of equity or debt securities  lease financing or other borrowings 
in addition  to the extent iwerks experiences growth in the future  or its cash flow from operations is less than anticipated  the company may be required to obtain additional sources of cash
