item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview following the company s launch of clave products in  the company s net sales have increased and the company has experienced a significant shift in demand towards the needleless clave system and away from its click lock and piggy lock protected needle products 
the company believes that the shift to needleless iv connection systems is taking place throughout the safe connector market  and will continue for the foreseeable future 
the company believes that its ability to increase its revenues and profits will depend  in large part  on the success of its marketing and distribution strategies for clave products  its ability to reduce unit manufacturing costs for clave  and its ability to develop  produce and sell new  innovative products 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  net sales by product as a percentage of total net sales product line clave click lock mcgaw protected needle lopez valve rf rf rhino budget medical products mcgaw safeline revenue sharing total the company believes that as the healthcare provider market continues to consolidate  the company s success in marketing and distributing clave products will depend  in part  on the company s ability  either independently or through strategic supply and distribution arrangements  to secure long term clave contracts with major buying organizations 
to gain additional access to large hospitals and major buying organizations  the company negotiated the mcgaw agreement and the abbott agreement 
those agreements establish minimum prices that mcgaw and abbott will pay for the company s products  which are lower than the company s current average selling prices and which the company negotiated in anticipation of significant sales to mcgaw and abbott 
the mcgaw agreement  provides for automatic reductions in minimum prices based on volume increases  and the abbott agreement provides for annual re negotiation of minimum prices 
although the company could experience declines in gross margins at the minimum price levels  the company believes that any such declines would be offset in part by improved absorption of manufacturing overhead as a result of increased production volumes anticipated from sales to mcgaw and abbott 
the company s marketing and distribution strategy may result in a significant share of the company s revenues being concentrated among a small number of customers 
the loss of a strategic supply and distribution agreement with a customer or the loss of a large contract by such a customer  could have a material adverse effect on operating results 
comparison of to in  the company reported net sales of  which was  or  higher than the net sales of  reported in the increase was primarily attributable to a  or  increase in clave sales  including revenue sharing from mcgaw on sales of clave products  and  of revenue sharing on mcgaw s sales of its safeline products  which payments were initiated also contributing to the increase were sales by the company s budget medical products subsidiary formed in late  sales of the low priced rhino and a modest increase in lopez valve sales 
those increases were partially offset by a decrease in click lock and piggy lock sales and a decrease in mcgaw protected needle sales 
the company s independent distributors accounted for of the company s net sales in  with mcgaw accounting for and abbott the remaining 
in  the comparable percentages were  and  respectively 
total clave net sales increased approximately from  in to  in unit shipments of clave products in increased approximately over  with independent distributors  mcgaw and abbott accounting for approximately  and  respectively  of this unit growth 
the aggregate average net selling price of clave products in decreased approximately as compared with that decrease reflects equally lower prices from independent distributors and lower prices on bulk  non sterile clave products sold to mcgaw and abbott 
net sales to mcgaw  including revenue sharing  amounted to  in  as compared to  in clave sales to mcgaw increased approximately  principally because of an increase in unit shipments 
net sales of the mcgaw protected needle declined and management expects those to continue to decline as the market for safe connectors continues its shift to needleless technology 
under a non exclusive strategic supply and distribution agreement with mcgaw  the company is entitled to share in certain incremental increases in mcgaw s clave selling prices 
the company recorded approximately  of revenue sharing on clave products in  but at mcgaw s current price levels  management does not expect to receive significantly greater amounts of revenue sharing on clave products sold to mcgaw  and there is no assurance that mcgaw s pricing in the future will result in any revenue sharing in the future 
based on mcgaw s forecasts  management expects increases in unit shipments to mcgaw in  although there is no assurance that this expectation will be realized 
under that same agreement  the company receives revenue sharing payments on mcgaw s sales of its safeline products  such payments commenced in  and the company recorded estimated revenue sharing of approximately  although management anticipates that such revenue sharing will continue  the actual amount will depend on the volume and selling prices of mcgaw s safeline products  which management has no means of forecasting accurately 
net sales to abbott amounted to  in  as compared to  in clave sales were  as compared with none in  with the balance of the sales in the low priced rhino 
under its non exclusive supply and distribution agreement with abbott  abbott pays minimum prices for clave and rhino products and the company is entitled to receive revenue sharing under a formula based on abbott s selling prices 
the minimum prices were negotiated in anticipation of significant sales to abbott  however  the agreement with abbott neither requires the purchase of minimum quantities nor prevents abbott from marketing competitive products  and there is no assurance that abbott will be successful in promoting and selling the company s products against its other products or against other competitors current or future products 
net sales in include  of revenue sharing recorded in the fourth quarter of related to sales through the third quarter of  principally related to the rhino product  abbott had not reported the fourth quarter revenue share in time to be recorded in the financial statements  and management did not believe that it has adequate history under the abbott agreement to estimate the amount 
management expects only a moderate increase in sales volume with abbott in  although the amount and timing will depend on abbott s sell through of products sold to it by the company and abbott s ability to expand its market for those products  and there is no assurance that such increases will be realized 
management believes the success of clave has  and will continue to motivate others to develop one piece needleless connectors which may incorporate many of the same functional and physical characteristics as the clave 
the company is aware of at least five such products 
in response to competitive pressure felt in the third quarter of  the company in mid october announced to its distributors a new aggressive pricing strategy to protect and expand its market 
prices to independent distributors will eventually be reduced up to approximately 
the average price reduction in the fourth quarter of was far less than the maximum  although management expects that the average price of its clave products will decline over the next several quarters 
management expects that the price decline will be more than offset by increased volume 
however  there is no assurance that such increased volume will be achieved  or that the company s current or future products will be able to successfully compete with products developed by others 
management expects that unit sales of clave to its independent distributors will increase in  although the size of such increase may be impacted by competition from existing and new competitive products or acquisition of clave market share by abbott and mcgaw 
management expects to encounter continued pricing pressure from individual end users  but believes that its new pricing strategy will improve its competitive position 
net sales of click lock and piggy lock decreased in as compared to  again because of the safe connector market s continued shift to needleless technology  and management expects that decline to continue 
the lopez valve and swiss system showed a growth in revenue as compared to because of increased unit shipments 
management expects continued modest increases in lopez valve sales in during the second quarter of  the company entered into a distribution agreement with boc ohmeda ab ohmeda  a major distributor of medical products  for distribution of clave in europe 
full launch of exclusive distribution in the united kingdom  france and the benelux countries commenced in the fourth quarter of  and distribution in most other countries in europe will be added in phases 
total sales to foreign distributors were  in management expects that its sales to foreign distributors will continue to increase in the future 
gross margin for improved to from the registered in the shift in sales mix toward a higher percentage of the relatively higher margin clave products  continued increases in the benefits of the company s extensive production automation  and the mcgaw safeline revenue sharing first recorded in more than offset the effect of lower average unit selling prices 
the company s budget medical products subsidiary bmp recorded approximately  net sales in  its first year of operations 
bmp markets custom iv sets  production of which is relatively labor intensive  resulting in a generally lower gross profit margin than for the company s other products 
bmp had a small negative gross profit margin in it expects to achieve a small positive gross profit margin in  as volume increases and improvements in production efficiency are achieved  although there can be no assurance that such increases and improvements will be achieved 
management expects that gross profit margins in bmp will be lower than those historically recorded by the company because production of its products is relatively labor intensive 
the company expects that its unit production costs will continue to decrease in as unit volumes increase  but that the gross margin percentage will stay at or slightly lower than that achieved in as average unit sales prices decrease 
selling  general and administrative costs sg a increased by approximately  to  in  as compared to  in as a percentage of sales  sg a costs were in and in the increase was primarily due to the continuing costs of patent litigation in which the company is the plaintiff  such costs were  in and  in see item  legal proceedings 
other sg a expenses increased at a somewhat lower rate than the increases in sales except for those related to bmp  which were not incurred in management expects sg a costs  exclusive of the patent litigation costs  to increase in  both in absolute terms and also slightly as a percentage of sales  because of growth in the company and marketing and promotional costs of new products expected to be introduced in management expects the patent litigation costs to decrease somewhat from the level experienced in  but the amount and timing of the costs will depend on the progress of the litigation  and no assurances can be given in this regard 
research and development r d costs increased in by approximately  to  or of net sales  as compared with approximately  or less than of sales  in the increase accelerated during the year as the company increased efforts to complete development on a number of new products 
those efforts will continue into  and management expects r d costs to continue at or higher than the level in the second half of until the principal product development efforts are completed in mid however  no assurance can be given that such costs will not differ from those estimates or that the r d will be completed as expected 
the operating margin decreased slightly in compared with  from to 
the effects of the improved gross profit was more than offset by the patent litigation costs and higher r d costs 
investment income increased in to  from  in because of increased funds invested 
funds increased because of the net proceeds of approximately  from the company s july public offering of common stock and cash provided by operations 
management expects that there may be a decrease in investment income in because of the use of funds to acquire treasury stock  but the amount of decrease  if any  will depend on the amount of stock acquired 
investment income would also be affected by any change in short term interest rate levels 
the company s effective income tax rate in was as compared with in a state manufacturing tax credit  recorded in the fourth quarter of both years  was lower in than in  and that effect was partially offset by a higher portion of income being tax exempt investment income in management expects its effective tax rate in to be equal to or slightly higher than the rate 
net income increased because of higher sales and gross profit margins offset by higher rates of sg a and r d in relation to sales 
net income per share increased due to the increase in net income  offset by the effect of additional shares issued in the public offering in july comparison of to net sales increased to  compared to  in the primary reason for this increase was higher clave unit sales 
total clave unit sales increased approximately compared to the company s independent distributors and mcgaw accounted for approximately and of this unit growth  respectively 
the aggregate average sales price on clave products decreased approximately in compared to this decrease was due to shifts in both customer and product mixes 
mcgaw purchases primarily lower cost bulk non sterile product versus higher priced packaged and sterilized products purchased by independent distributors 
clave unit shipments to mcgaw represented approximately of total clave unit shipments in compared to only in in addition  a larger percentage of clave units purchased by mcgaw in were lower cost bulk claves compared to resulting in lower average selling prices to mcgaw 
total clave sales dollars increased approximately to approximately  in compared to  in click lock sales continued to decrease at a steady rate 
click lock sales decreased from approximately  in to approximately  in mcgaw protected needle sales increased from approximately  in to approximately  in demand for mcgaw s protected needle in was essentially the same as that in the dollar increase realized by the company in was due to the fact that the company increased its production of this product mid way through and throughout to supply all of mcgaw s requirements 
lopez valve and swiss system sales increased approximately to approximately  in compared to approximately  in the company designed and manufactured the rf during at the request of abbott 
rf sales to abbott in were approximately  gross margins improved in to compared to in the company dramatically increased its production capacity in the increased capacity was not fully utilized in higher production volumes in resulted in a greater absorption of overhead 
in addition  certain start up costs associated with clave in did not recur in due to higher production volumes and various cost cutting measures employed in  manufacturing overhead as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in by the fourth quarter of manufacturing overhead as a percentage of sales decreased to of net sales and the gross margin was 
sg a expenses increased approximately  to approximately  in from approximately  in as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased to compared to in the primary reason for the increase related to significantly higher advertising and promotion of clave in compared to sales and marketing expenses increased approximately  in compared to legal fees related the company s is patent litigation see above and item  legal proceedings decreased to approximately  in from approximately  in research and development expenses decreased somewhat in compared to operating margin increased in to from in due to higher gross margins offset slightly by higher sales and marketing expenses as noted above 
during the fourth quarter of  operating margins reached due to higher gross margins 
the company s effective tax rate in was compared to in the effective tax rate in was lower than statutory rates due to a state manufacturing tax credit recorded in the fourth quarter 
in  the company also received a tax benefit related to a reduction in the valuation allowance established against the company s deferred tax asset 
net income increased primarily due to higher sales and higher operating margins 
net income per share increased due to the factors noted above  offset somewhat by the issuance of  shares in the secondary public offering completed in july liquidity and capital resources during  working capital increased approximately  to  from  the company s cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  including liquid investments  increased to  from  those increases were due primarily to  of cash flows from operating activities and  from stock options exercised principally tax benefits  offset by  used to acquire treasury stock 
during  working capital increased approximately  to  from  the company s cash and cash equivalents and investment securities position increased to  from  those increases were due primarily to approximately  cash flow from operating activities and  in net proceeds raised in a common stock offering which closed july  in which  new shares were issued 
capital expenditures were reduced significantly in and compared to during  the company made significant investments to increase production capacity to facilitate the agreements with mcgaw and abbott 
management believes it now has adequate production capacity to meet demand for the foreseeable future  although it expects to add some machinery and equipment and molds in for production of new products 
management expects that sales of the company s products will continue to grow in if sales continue to increase  accounts receivable and inventories are expected to increase as well 
in addition  the company intends to continue to expand its sales force by adding more product specialists and marketing support personnel 
as a result of these and other factors  the company expects the use of working capital to fund its operations to continue to increase 
management has announced that it expects to spend million to million beyond amounts spent through december  to repurchase its common stock 
through february   the company has spent an additional  to acquire  shares 
future acquisitions  if any  will depend on market conditions and other factors and their amount could change significantly from the announced expectation 
the company believes  however  that its existing working capital  supplemented by income from operations  will be sufficient for the foreseeable future
