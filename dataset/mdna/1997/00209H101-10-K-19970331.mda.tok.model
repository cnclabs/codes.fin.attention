item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  the company incurred operating and net losses of million and million  respectively  as compared to operating and net income of million and million in as discussed in more detail below  the losses in reflected a number of factors  including i a significant increase in competition from larger carriers in the scheduled service markets served by the company  ii the effects of the valujet accident in florida that occurred at the same time as a decompression incident on one of the company s flights  iii a significant increase in fuel prices  iv a federal excise tax on jet fuel that became effective on october   and v certain charges in the third and fourth quarters of relating to fleet restructuring 
the company believes that competition will remain intense for the foreseeable future on many of the routes where the company has provided scheduled service 
as a result  and as described further below  beginning in august  the company significantly reduced its scheduled service operations and completed a reduction in its overall fleet size in order to concentrate on its charter operations  which may produce as much as two thirds of the company s operating revenues in restructuring of scheduled service operations and fleet types beginning in may  and continuing into the third quarter  the company undertook a detailed study of the profitability of its scheduled service  military and tour operator business segments 
this analysis initially covered the six quarters ended june   and disclosed that a significant number of scheduled service markets being served by the company had become increasingly unprofitable 
although some markets had been unprofitable during  a more significant deterioration in profitability in boston  intra florida and certain other markets occurred during late and the first half of this analysis also showed that the company s charter and military operations were generally profitable during the same periods  although results from these operations in were also adversely affected by some of the factors that affected scheduled service 
the company believes that several key factors had contributed to the deteriorating profitability of scheduled service over these time periods 
beginning in january  a growing amount of low fare competition entered boston florida and midwest florida markets  which increased total capacity in these markets and decreased the average fares earned by the company 
operating revenues in all scheduled service markets were further adversely affected by the valujet accident in florida on may  which was followed on may by a decompression incident on one of the company s own flights 
these events focused significant negative media attention on airline safety and on low fare carriers in particular 
in spite of the company s excellent safety record over almost a quarter century of operation  during which no serious injuries or fatalities had ever occurred  the company estimates that it lost significant scheduled service revenues in the second and third quarters of from canceled reservations  and reservations which were never received 
additionally  effective october   the company became subject to a federal excise tax on jet fuel consumed in domestic use which added approximately cents to the average cost of each gallon of jet fuel 
during  the market price excluding tax of jet fuel also increased significantly as compared to prices paid in comparable periods  largely due to tight jet fuel inventories relative to demand throughout this period 
these trends continued and  as discussed below  intensified in certain respects in the fourth quarter of moreover  the company believes that intense competitive pressures from larger carriers will continue for the foreseeable future on many of the routes served by the company s scheduled service operations 
on august  the company announced a significant reduction in scheduled service business 
more than one third of scheduled service departures and asms were included in this schedule reduction 
boston operations and intra florida flights were completely eliminated 
other selected markets from indianapolis  chicago midway and milwaukee were also exited completely or were reduced in frequency 
exited operations ended between september and december the company continues to evaluate its scheduled service operations and may further reduce or potentially restore some of its scheduled operations 
in association with its schedule reduction  the company announced a reduction in force of 
a significant portion of this reduction in force was accomplished through furloughs of cockpit and cabin crews  with the remainder consisting of reductions in base station and administrative staff 
maintenance staff reductions were accomplished primarily through the reduction of base and line maintenance contract labor 
this reduction commenced during september and resulted in the recognition of  in severance expense for the third quarter of  and  in additional severance expense for the fourth quarter of a separate aspect of the company s study of business segment profitability was directed toward the relative economics of the company s three aircraft fleet types as they were being used in scheduled service  charter and military flying 
although all fleet types were being used profitably in some operations  the company determined that in many scheduled service markets the boeing was a more profitable alternative aircraft than the boeing as a result  on july   the company entered into a letter of intent with a major lessor to reduce the company s boeing fleet by five units  and in the fourth quarter of the company entered into an additional transaction with the same lessor to further reduce the number of boeing aircraft by two units 
these transactions were completed by december   and reduced the company s fleet of boeing aircraft as of the end of from a previously planned thirteen units to seven actual units 
in addition  these transactions eliminated all pratt whitney powered boeing aircraft from the company s fleet  which became solely rolls royce powered by the end of in addition to the adjustments to the company s boeing fleet  the reduction in existing scheduled service operations resulted in the reallocation of five boeing aircraft to alternative uses in the fourth quarter of these aircraft were used to meet additional charter demand and to increase scheduled service flights in several markets which the company continues to serve 
two lockheed l aircraft which were used for seasonal scheduled service to ireland during the summer of were returned to charter operations in the fourth quarter of in  the company recorded a million loss on disposal of assets associated with boeing aircraft see disposal of assets 
results of operations the company s operating revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in operating revenues for were cents per asm  a reduction of from cents per asm in between these same periods  asms increased to billion from billion  rpms increased to billion from billion  and passenger load factor declined to as compared to

scheduled service revenues 
scheduled service revenues in increased to million from million in scheduled service revenues comprised of total operating revenues in  as compared to of operating revenues in scheduled service rpms increased to billion from billion  while asms increased to billion from billion  resulting in a reduction in passenger load factor to in from in yield on scheduled service in increased to cents per rpm from cents per rpm in scheduled service departures in increased to  from  in  while passengers boarded increased over such period to  as compared to  during the second and third quarters of  and prior to the restructuring of scheduled service operations as further described below  the company added direct or connecting flights through the company s four major domestic cities of indianapolis  chicago midway  milwaukee and boston to west coast and florida markets already being served 
new seasonal scheduled service was also operated during the summer months from new york to shannon and dublin  ireland  and belfast  northern ireland  and from the midwest to seattle 
new year round service was also added to san diego  california  in the second quarter of second and third quarter scheduled service in st 
louis was discontinued in august in association with the restructuring of the company s scheduled service operations  a significant reduction in scheduled service was announced on august between september and december   more than one third of the scheduled service capacity operating during the summer months was eliminated 
all scheduled service flights to and from boston were eliminated by december   including service to west palm beach  san juan  montego bay  st 
petersburg  las vegas  orlando and ft 
lauderdale 
intra florida services connecting the cities of ft 
lauderdale  orlando  miami  sarasota  st 
petersburg and ft 
myers were eliminated as of october  other selected services from indianapolis  chicago midway and milwaukee to florida and to west coast destinations were also reduced or eliminated by october  the company s scheduled service between chicago midway and the cities of indianapolis and milwaukee was replaced with a code share agreement with chicago express on october  in association with this service reduction  all scheduled service ceased at seattle  grand cayman  west palm beach  montego bay  miami and san diego 
after this scheduled service reduction  the company s core scheduled service flying included flights between chicago midway and five florida cities  las vegas  phoenix  los angeles and san francisco  indianapolis to four florida cities  las vegas and cancun  milwaukee to three florida cities  hawaii service to san francisco  los angeles and phoenix  and service between orlando and san juan and nassau 
the company s strategy for restructuring scheduled service operations in the manner described above is to eliminate service in unprofitable scheduled service markets  to enhance the profit potential of remaining scheduled service markets  to reallocate aircraft to alternative operations and to dispose of surplus aircraft 
through this process  the company intends to strengthen its competitive position and to improve both passenger load factors and yields in remaining scheduled service operations 
based upon the company s analysis of scheduled service profitability through the final months of  it has determined that the performance of this operation improved in december as compared to august  which was the last full month of scheduled service operations conducted prior to the implementation of the restructuring plan 
in addition  the company has noted early in the first quarter of that scheduled service bookings  passenger load factors and yields are all performing better than they did early in the first quarter of the company will continue to evaluate the profit and loss performance of scheduled service during  and the company may take further steps to restructure this operation 
charter revenues 
the company s charter revenues are derived principally from independent tour operators and from the united states military 
total charter revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in charter revenue growth  prior to scheduled service restructuring in late  was constrained by the dedication of a significant portion of the company s fleet to scheduled service expansion  including the utilization of two lockheed l aircraft for scheduled services to ireland and northern ireland between may and september the analysis of profitability by business component which was performed by the company for the six quarters ended june   disclosed that both military and tour operator components had produced consistent profits over the period studied 
the company s lockheed l fleet performed well in a charter environment based upon relatively low frequency of operation and high passenger load factors  and the boeing performed well in the military business component while the boeing worked well with certain tour operators 
the company began to implement strategies to improve the financial performance of charter operations in the third and fourth quarters of  and both tour operator and military flying are expected to play a role of growing significance in the company s future business operations 
charter revenues derived from independent tour operators including the ambassadair travel club decreased to million in  as compared to million in tour operator revenues comprised of operating revenues in  as compared to of operating revenues in tour operator asms decreased to billion from billion and the revenue per asm rasm on tour operator revenues in increased to cents  as compared to cents in tour operator passengers boarded increased to  in  as compared to  in  and tour operator departures decreased to  in  as compared to  in the company operates in two principal components of the tour operator business  known as track charter and specialty charter 
the larger track charter business component is generally comprised of repetitive domestic and international flights between designated city pairs  which support high passenger load factor and low frequency rotations marketed through tour operators  and which provide value priced and convenient non stop service to these vacation destinations 
the track charter business component allows the company to attain reasonable levels of aircraft and crew utilization and often provides significant protection to the company from fuel price increases through the use of fuel escalation reimbursement clauses 
the company s analysis of profitability for track charter operations in and  however  disclosed only modest average profit margins for those periods 
during the late restructuring of scheduled service operations  therefore  the company also sought to negotiate changes in existing track charter contracts to provide better profit performance for this business segment 
although some tour operators were not able to maintain existing programs with the company under required economics  other tour operators  and new tour operators  have agreed to new contracts under which the company expects to improve track charter profit performance in future periods 
these new agreements generally become effective for the spring and summer of specialty charter flying is a product which is highly customized to the requirements of the buyer  but is generally operated with much lower frequency than track charter 
for example  the company operates an increasing number of around the world trips in all first class configuration for certain corporate clients 
the company s profitability analysis for and disclosed that specialty charter contracts provided a superior profit margin when compared to track charter  even though these operations were cost disadvantaged by a lower achievable utilization rate for aircraft and crews 
in order to leverage these attractive margins  the company has increased the number of specialty charter contracts in its business mix for and continues to aggressively seek these relationships with potential clients by marketing the company s unique ability to package and deliver highly specialized products to customers with particular requirements 
the company believes that improved track charter economics  combined with expanded high margin specialty charter programs  offer a unique opportunity to the company to improve the overall financial performance of this business segment in and future years 
charter revenues derived from the us military increased to million in  as compared to million in military revenues comprised of total operating revenues in  as compared to of total operating revenues in us military asms increased to billion from billion 
the rasm on us military revenues in increased to cents as compared to cents in us military passengers boarded decreased to  in  as compared to  in  and us military departures decreased to  in  as compared to  in the company s and profitability analysis of the military business disclosed that although this operation was generally profitable  more attractive margins were available from the use of the boeing aircraft in certain military rotations  principally as a result of the lower operating cost of this aircraft type as compared to alternative aircraft types in similar applications 
the company believes that the us military often prefers the boeing aircraft for its smaller capacity and longer range when used to maintain existing frequencies to foreign military bases with reduced troop deployments 
the company also believes that its boeing fleet is competitively advantaged by its faa certification to operate with minute etops  which enhances opportunities for the company to obtain awards of certain long range military missions over water 
as a result of these factors  for the military contract year ending september   the company has committed four of its seven remaining boeing aircraft to the military business  while the other three boeing aircraft are deployed to mission specific uses within scheduled service 
ground package revenues 
the company earns ground package revenues through the sale of hotel  car rental and cruise accommodations in conjunction with the company s air transportation product 
the company markets these ground packages through its ambassadair travel club subsidiary exclusively to club members and through its ata vacations subsidiary to the general public 
ground package revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in the company s year old ambassadair travel club offers hundreds of choices of tour guide accompanied vacation packages to its approximately  individual and family members annually 
in  total packages sold increased as compared to  and the average price of each ground package sold increased as compared to the prior year 
ata vacations offers numerous ground package combinations to the general public for use on the company s scheduled service flights throughout the united states and to selected mexico and caribbean destinations 
these packages are marketed through travel agents  as well as directly by the company s own reservation centers 
during  the number of ground packages sold increased as compared to  but the average price of each ground package sold decreased as compared to the prior year 
the average price paid to the company for a ground package sale is a function of the mix of vacation destinations served  the quality and types of ground accommodations offered  and general competitive conditions with other air carriers offering similar products in the company s markets 
some ata vacations markets have experienced price reductions in due to intense price competition 
the average gross margin on ata vacations ground packages sold in declined to as compared to in  while the average gross margin on ambassadair travel club ground package sales declined to in  as compared to in the prior year 
other revenues 
other revenues are comprised of the consolidated revenues of affiliated companies  together with miscellaneous categories of revenue associated with the scheduled and charter operations of the company 
other revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in approximately million of the revenue increase between years was attributable to an increase in the number of block hours of substitute service provided by the company to other airlines 
a substitute service agreement typically provides for the company to operate an aircraft with its own crews on routes designated by the customer airline to carry the passengers of that airline for a limited period of time 
the remaining increase in other revenues between periods was primarily due to revenue growth in several of the company s affiliated businesses 
operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits include the cost of salaries and wages paid to the company s employees  together with the company s cost of employee benefits and payroll related state and federal taxes 
salaries  wages and benefits expense for increased to million from million in approximately million of the increase in was attributable to the addition of cockpit and cabin crews  reservations agents  base station staff and maintenance staff to support the company s growth in capacity between periods  and approximately million of the increase was attributable to the related growth in employee benefits costs 
average company full time equivalent employees increased by in as compared to the prior year  although the reduction in force implemented in late resulted in approximately fewer full time equivalent employees in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of the company substantially completed this reduction in force in the fourth quarter of  and recorded  in related severance costs in salaries  wages and benefits expense in was cents per asm  an increase of from a cost of cents per asm in the cost per asm increased partially as a result of a increase in the average rate of pay for the company s employees as compared to the prior year 
in addition  the company has increased employment in several maintenance and base station locations in lieu of continuing the use of third party contractors  as it believes it can provide more reliable operations and better customer service at a lower total cost by using its own employees in these selected locations 
the company has experienced related savings in the expense lines of handling  landing and navigation fees  and in aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs  as further described in those following sections 
in december  the company implemented a four year collective bargaining agreement with its flight attendants  which was the first of the company s labor groups to elect union representation 
an additional four year collective bargaining agreement was ratified by the company s cockpit crews on september  the pay related terms of the new cockpit crew agreement were implemented retroactively to august   including  among other things  a rate increase of approximately to cockpit crew pay scales for the first year of the new contract 
fuel and oil 
fuel and oil expense for increased to million from million in  due to an increase in fuel consumed to operate the company s expanded block hours of flying  an increase in the average price paid per gallon of fuel consumed and the imposition of a cent per gallon excise tax on jet fuel consumed for domestic use effective october  during  the company consumed more gallons of jet fuel for flying operations and flew more block hours than in  which accounted for approximately million in additional fuel and oil expense between years excluding price and tax changes 
the growth in gallons of fuel consumed was lower than the growth in block hours flown between years due to a change in the mix of block hours flown by fleet type 
of greatest significance was the reduction of total block hours flown by the lockheed l fleet between periods  since the fuel burn per block hour for this wide body aircraft is approximately twice as high as the burn rates for the company s other fleet types 
during  the company s average price paid per gallon of fuel consumed excluding the excise tax described in the following paragraph increased by as compared to fuel price increases paid by the company reflected generally tighter supply conditions for aviation fuel  which persisted throughout most of as compared to the prior year 
the company estimates that the year over year increase in average price paid for jet fuel resulted in approximately million in additional fuel and oil expense between periods 
on october   the company became subject to a cent per gallon excise tax on jet fuel consumed for domestic use by commercial air carriers 
the effect of this tax in the first three quarters of  as compared to the first three quarters of  was to increase the company s cost of jet fuel by approximately million 
fuel and oil expense for was cents per asm  an increase of as compared to cents per asm in the increase in the cost per asm of fuel and oil expense was primarily a result of higher prices and the new excise tax  partially offset by the expanded use of the more fuel efficient twin engine boeing aircraft in the company s fleet 
during  the company s boeing aircraft accounted for of total block hours flown  as compared to of total block hours flown in due to the reduction of the company s boeing fleet in late  the company s mix of block hours flown in future years is expected to reflect a lower proportion of fuel efficient boeing block hours  and a higher proportion of the less fuel efficient boeing and lockheed l fleet types 
handling  landing and navigation fees 
handling and landing fees include the costs incurred by the company at airports to land and service its aircraft and to handle passenger check in  security and baggage where the company elects to use third party contract services in lieu of its own employees 
air navigation fees are assessed when the company s aircraft fly over certain foreign airspace 
handling  landing and navigation fees decreased by to million in  as compared to million in during  the average cost per system departure for third party aircraft handling declined as compared to the prior year  and the average cost of landing fees per system departure decreased between the same periods 
because each airport served by the company has a different schedule of fees  including variable prices for different aircraft types  average handling and landing fee costs are a function of the mix of airports served as well as the fleet composition of departing aircraft 
on average  these costs for narrow body aircraft are less than for wide body aircraft  and the average costs at domestic us airports are less than the average costs at most foreign airports 
in  of the company s departures were operated with narrow body aircraft  as compared to in  and of the company s departures were from us domestic locations  as compared to in handling costs also vary from period to period according to decisions made by the company to use third party handling services at some airports in lieu of using the company s own employees 
during  the company implemented a policy of self handling at four domestic us airports with significant operations  which had been substantially handled using third party contractors in the prior year 
this change resulted in lower absolute third party handling costs for these locations and contributed to lower system average contract handling costs per departure for  as compared to the company incurred higher salaries  wages and benefits expense as a result of this policy change  as noted in salaries  wages and benefits 
the cost per asm for handling  landing and navigation fees decreased to cents in from cents in aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals expense for increased to million from million in this increase was attributable to continued growth in the size of the company s leased aircraft fleet  although the company significantly reduced the size of its boeing fleet in the fourth quarter of  as is more fully described in disposal of assets 
the addition of three leased boeing aircraft in the first three quarters of resulted in approximately million of increased aircraft rentals for that time period  as compared to the prior year 
the subsequent reduction of this fleet type by a net four units after including two new deliveries from the manufacturer in december resulted in a year over year fourth quarter reduction of aircraft rent expense of approximately million 
the reduction in the size of the boeing fleet was an integral component of the company s restructuring of scheduled service  based upon profitability analysis which disclosed that for some uses of the boeing in the company s markets prior to restructuring  it was more profitable to substitute other aircraft with lower ownership costs 
several additional boeing and lockheed l aircraft leased in contributed million and million  respectively  in incremental aircraft rentals between years 
aircraft rentals expense was reduced by million for the first four months of  as compared to the prior year  due to the purchase of four pratt whitney spare engines in may  which had been previously leased 
due to the elimination of all pratt whitney powered boeing aircraft from the company s fleet  the company has reclassified these owned spare engines as assets held for sale in the accompanying balance sheet  and is actively marketing these assets to users of pratt whitney powered aircraft 
aircraft rentals expense for was cents per asm  an increase of from cents per asm in the period over period increase in the size of the boeing fleet was a significant factor in this change  since the rental cost of asms produced by this fleet type is significantly higher than for the company s other aircraft 
with the reduction in the higher ownership cost boeing aircraft in late  the company anticipates that the cost per asm produced by its leased aircraft fleet will be lower in future years than it was in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation reflects the periodic expensing of the recorded cost of owned lockheed l airframes  engines and rotable parts for all fleet types  together with other property and equipment owned by the company 
amortization is the periodic expensing of capitalized airframe and engine overhauls for all fleet types on a units of production basis using aircraft flight hours and cycles landings as the units of measure 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased to million from million in depreciation expense attributable to owned airframes and engines  and other property and equipment owned by the company  increased million in as compared to the prior year 
the company increased its year over year ownership of engines and rotable aircraft components to support the expanding fleet  and increased its investment in computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 
the company also placed the west bay of the renovated midway hangar no 
into service in mid and incurred increased debt issue costs between years related to debt facility and aircraft lease negotiations completed in amortization of capitalized engine and airframe overhauls increased million in as compared to the prior year  after including the offsetting amortization of approximately million in associated manufacturers credits 
the increasing cost of overhaul amortization reflects the increase in the number of aircraft added to the company s fleet and the increase in cycles and block hours flown between years 
new aircraft introduced into the company s fleet generally do not require airframe or engine overhauls until one or more years after first entering service 
therefore  the resulting amortization of these overhauls generally occurs on a delayed basis from the date the aircraft is placed into service 
accordingly  the company anticipates that the average cost of engine and airframe amortization per block hour and cycle will increase in future years for all fleet types  as all aircraft receive their initial engine and airframe overhauls after being placed into service 
the cost of engine overhauls that become worthless due to early engine failures  and which cannot be economically repaired  is charged to depreciation and amortization expense in the period the engine fails 
depreciation and amortization expense attributable to these write offs increased million between years 
when these engine failures can be economically repaired  the related repairs are charged to aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense 
depreciation and amortization cost per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
this expense line includes the cost of expendable aircraft spare parts  repairs to repairable and rotable aircraft components  contract labor for base and line maintenance activities  and other non capitalized direct costs related to fleet maintenance  including spare engine leases  parts loan and exchange fees  and related shipping costs 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in the cost per asm decreased by to cents in  as compared to cents in the prior year 
although the cost of repairs for repairable and rotable components increased million between periods  the cost of expendable parts consumed decreased million  and the cost of parts loans and exchanges decreased million 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs cost was also reduced by million in  as compared to  due to a planned reduction in the use of third party maintenance staff in favor of using more company maintenance employees for both base and line maintenance activities 
the company incurred higher salaries  wages and benefits expense as a result of this policy change  as noted in a preceding section 
the cost of the company s maintenance  materials and repairs remained essentially unchanged in  as contrasted to the increase in asms between years  and the increase in block hours 
this favorable comparison is partly due to the significant expansion of the company s fleet during when used aircraft are initially brought into the company s fleet  the cost of maintenance  materials and repairs required to bridge that aircraft into the company s maintenance program are capitalized 
such expenditures normally extend the available flying hours for that aircraft before routine heavy maintenance  materials and repairs expenses begin to be incurred  although those aircraft begin producing both asms and block hours immediately upon acquisition 
the more favorable comparison to block hours between years is also indicative of the faster growth in the company s twin engine boeing fleet  which is composed of newer and more technologically advanced aircraft which require relatively less routine maintenance than the company s older three engine lockheed l and boeing fleets 
the boeing fleet accounted for of block hours in  as compared to in nevertheless  due to the reduction of the company s boeing fleet in late  the company s mix of block hours flown in future years is expected to reflect a lower proportion of boeing block hours  and a higher proportion of block hours flown by the older three engine lockheed l and boeing fleets 
all of the company s aircraft under operating leases have certain return conditions applicable to the maintenance status of airframes and engines as of the termination of the lease 
the company accrues estimated return condition costs as a component of maintenance  materials and repairs expense  based upon the actual condition of the aircraft as each lease termination date approaches and based upon the company s ability to estimate the expected cost of conforming to these conditions 
return condition expenses accrued in were million more than in this increase was primarily due to changes in the mix of aircraft leases and associated return conditions which became effective during  offset by both the extensive restructuring of the boeing fleet and the sale leaseback of six hushkitted boeing aircraft during under new lease terms and conditions 
crew and other employee travel 
crew and other employee travel is primarily the cost of air transportation  hotels and per diem reimbursements to cockpit and cabin crew members that is incurred to position crews away from their bases to operate all company flights throughout the world 
the cost of air transportation is generally more significant for the charter business segment since these flights often operate between cities in which company crews are not normally based and may involve extensive international positioning of crews 
hotel and per diem expenses are incurred for both scheduled and charter services  although higher per diem and hotel rates generally apply to international assignments 
the cost of crew and other employee travel increased to million in  as compared to million in during  the company increased its average full time equivalent crew head count by as compared to the prior year  even though departures increased by and block hours increased by between periods 
in the first quarter of  the company experienced crew shortages  which were exacerbated by severe winter weather  which caused significant flight delays  diversions and cancellations 
the company s crew complement in the third quarter of was again insufficient to effectively operate the flying schedule and resulted in more crew time being spent away from base during that quarter 
the cost per asm for crew and other employee travel increased to cents in  as compared to cents in the prior year 
this increase in unit cost was approximately equivalent to a average increase in the cost per crew member of hotel  positioning and per diem expenses between years 
passenger service 
passenger service expense includes the onboard costs of meal and non alcoholic beverage catering  the cost of alcoholic beverages and headsets sold and the cost of onboard entertainment programs  together with certain costs incurred for mishandled baggage and passengers inconvenienced due to flight delays or cancellations 
for and  catering represented and  respectively  of total passenger service expense 
the cost of passenger service decreased in to million  as compared to million in although total passengers boarded increased by to million in  as compared to million in  the average cost to cater each passenger declined between years due to a planned reduction in catering service levels in select charter and scheduled service markets beginning in the second quarter of this cost reduction was partially offset by a increase in military passengers boarded between years  who are the most expensive passengers to cater in the company s business mix 
the cost of servicing passengers who were inconvenienced by trip interruptions increased by million between years 
approximately million of this increase was incurred in association with the severe winter weather and consequent flight schedule disruptions which occurred in the first quarter of the cost per asm of passenger service decreased to cents in  as compared to cents in the prior year 
the lower cost per asm was primarily due to the lower cost of catering per passenger boarded  partially offset by the higher cost per asm of servicing inconvenienced passengers 
commissions 
the company incurs significant commissions expense in association with the sale by travel agents of single seats on scheduled service 
in addition  the company pays commissions to secure some tour operator and military business 
commissions expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the primary reason for the increase between years was the corresponding increase in scheduled service revenues earned  approximately two thirds of which was generated through travel agencies who received a commission on such sales 
the cost per asm of commissions expense was unchanged at cents for both and ground package cost 
ground package cost includes the expenses incurred by the company for hotels  car rental companies  cruise lines and similar vendors to provide ground and cruise accommodations to ambassadair and ata vacations customers 
ground package cost increased to million in  as compared to million in this increase in cost is primarily due to the increase in the number of ground packages sold between periods 
in  ambassadair sold more ground packages  and ata vacations sold more ground packages  than in the average cost of each ground package sold by ambassadair increased between years  while the average price of each ground package sold by ata vacations decreased by between periods 
ground package cost per asm increased by to cents in  as compared to cents in  which reflects the comparatively faster growth in ground package sales produced by ambassadair and ata vacations as compared to the overall asm growth of the company between years 
other selling expenses 
other selling expenses are comprised of i booking fees paid to the crss to reserve single seat sales for scheduled service  ii credit card discount expenses incurred when selling single seats and ground packages to customers using credit cards for payment  iii costs of providing toll free telephone services  primarily to single seat and vacation package customers who contact the company directly to book reservations  and iv miscellaneous other selling expenses that are primarily associated with single seat sales 
other selling expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in approximately million and million  respectively  of this increase was attributable to more credit card discounts and crs fees incurred to support the growth in scheduled service between years 
another million of the increase was due to higher usage of toll free telephone service between periods  some of which was associated with the accommodation of passengers onto other carriers flights due to the company s reduction of scheduled service in the third and fourth quarters of other selling cost per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in advertising 
advertising expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the company incurs advertising costs primarily to support single seat scheduled service sales and the sale of ground packages 
advertising support for this line of business increased consistent with the growth in associated revenues and the need to meet competitive actions in the company s markets 
the cost per asm of advertising increased to cents in  as compared to cents in facilities and other rentals 
facilities and other rentals includes the costs of all ground facilities that are leased by the company such as airport space  regional sales offices and general offices 
the cost of facilities and other rentals increased to million in  as compared to million in the increase in expense noted for was partly attributable to higher facility costs resulting from the company becoming a signatory carrier at orlando international airport  together with a year over year increase in facility costs for boston operations prior to the elimination of scheduled service at boston in the fourth quarter of the increased facility costs at orlando international airport have associated savings in lower handling and landing fees for the company s flights at orlando international airport 
also in  the company incurred facility rental expense in association with the late sale leaseback of the indianapolis hangar to the city of indianapolis  for the chicago midway hangar no 
and for the new chicago reservations facility  which was first occupied in september the cost per asm for facility and other rents increased to cents in  as compared to cents in disposal of assets 
during the third quarter of  the company committed to a plan to dispose of up to seven boeing aircraft 
a letter of intent was signed with a major lessor on july  which included the cancellation of operating leases on five aircraft and the return of those aircraft to the lessor before the end of negotiations also commenced with a major lessor during the third quarter for the cancellation of operating leases on two additional aircraft in during the third quarter  the company recorded a loss on disposal of the initial five aircraft according to the terms and conditions negotiated and agreed in the letter of intent 
an estimate of the expected loss on disposal of the additional two aircraft was also recorded in the third quarter  although a specific letter of intent had not yet been signed 
the total loss on disposal recorded in the third quarter was million for all aircraft 
these aircraft transactions were all completed during the fourth quarter of  at which time the estimated loss on disposal was reduced by million to an actual loss of million 
the source of the loss on the termination of these aircraft leases was primarily from the write off of the unused net book value of the associated airframe and engine overhauls 
for several aircraft  the company was required to meet additional maintenance return conditions associated with airframes and engines  the cost of which was charged to the loss on disposal 
these costs were partially offset by cash proceeds received from the lessor and by the application of associated deferred aircraft rent credits and manufacturers credits 
in addition to these costs  the company owns four spare pratt whitney engines  together with consumable  repairable and rotable components that are specific to the pratt whitney powered boeing s 
the net book value of these engines and parts approximates million as of december  the company is actively seeking to sell these assets and has therefore reclassified their net book value as assets held for sale under current assets in the accompanying balance sheet 
other expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in significant components of the year over year variances include increases in substitute service and passenger reprotection costs  professional fees  data communications costs  insurance costs and consulting fees in connection with the detailed route profitability study 
other operating cost per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in income tax expense in  the company recorded million in tax credits applicable to the loss before income taxes for that year  while income tax expense of million was recognized pertaining to income before taxes for the effective tax rate applicable to tax credits in was  and the effective tax rate for income earned in was 
the company s effective income tax rates are unfavorably affected by the permanent non deductibility from taxable income of of crew per diem expenses incurred in both years 
the impact of these permanent differences on effective tax rates becomes more pronounced as taxable income declines or losses increase 
year ended december   versus year ended december  operating revenues total operating revenues for increased million  or  to million 
this increase from was due to a million increase in scheduled service revenues  a million increase in charter revenues  a million increase in ground package sales and a million increase in other revenues 
operating revenues for were cents per asm  an increase of from revenues of cents per asm 
scheduled service revenues 
scheduled service revenues increased from million in to million in the majority of this increase was due to strong scheduled service traffic growth between periods  together with an improvement in scheduled service yield 
scheduled service rpms increased in compared to on a capacity increase of in asms between years  resulting in an improved passenger load factor of in as compared to in passengers boarded increased from million in to million in scheduled service departures increased from  in to  in the company increased scheduled service traffic from indianapolis  chicago midway  milwaukee and boston to florida  las vegas  hawaii and selected caribbean destinations 
scheduled service flown in from st 
louis and boston had no comparable service in the company ceased scheduled service operations in st 
louis in august  but continues to serve important charter markets from st 
louis 
scheduled service yield in was cents per rpm  an increase of over the scheduled service yield of cents per rpm 
this yield improvement was achieved gradually throughout as the result of several revenue enhancement initiatives 
during the first quarter of  the company installed a yield management system which allowed for the introduction of multiple fare levels for various classes of the company s inventory of scheduled service seats 
these yield management procedures were applied with increasing effectiveness through the final three quarters of whereas first quarter yields were lower than the first quarter of  second quarter yields were higher than the second quarter of  third quarter yields were higher than the third quarter of  and fourth quarter yields were higher than the fourth quarter of in the third quarter of  the company increased its level of participation and effectiveness of schedule display in several important crss used by travel agencies 
in may  the company also introduced connecting fares which offered new displays of multiple city pairs for sale in crs systems which had previously not been offered against competing carriers serving those connecting markets 
charter revenues 
charter revenues increased from million in to million in the company s charter revenues are derived primarily from independent tour operators and from the united states military 
the company s charter product provides full service air transportation to hundreds of customer designated destinations throughout the world 
charter revenues derived from independent tour operators increased from million in to million in most of this revenue increase was derived from stronger tour operator traffic between years  while tour operator yield improved from cents per rpm in to cents per rpm in tour operator rpms increased from billion in to billion in  while asms increased from billion in to billion in  resulting in an improved passenger load factor of in as compared to in the prior year 
passengers boarded increased from million in to million in  while departures increased from  in to  in tour operator departures for both and served numerous us leisure destinations  together with cities in europe  mexico  south america and asia 
charter revenues derived from the us military decreased from million in to million in military revenues were unfavorably impacted by declines in both traffic and yield between periods 
military rpms declined from billion in to billion in  while asms decreased from billion in to billion in  resulting in an improved passenger load factor of in as compared to in the prior year 
passengers boarded decreased from million in to million in  while departures declined from  in to  in the company and other competing air carriers are compensated for us military flying based upon reimbursement rates set by the united states government 
these reimbursement rates have generally declined over the last several contract years  resulting in lower yields for this business segment 
military yield in declined to cents per rpm as compared to cents per rpm in although the company s military yields are comparatively higher than for tour operators and scheduled service business segments  military passenger load factors are comparatively much lower  and the company can incur substantial non recurring costs to accommodate military flying which often becomes available on short notice 
the company s reduction of military asms in was largely the result of decisions to deploy the company s aircraft into selected scheduled service and tour operator markets  where the company believes that more repetitive frequencies and more predictable revenues and costs can be achieved in the long term 
ground package revenues 
ground package revenues increased from million in to million in ground packages  such as hotel and car rentals  are sold in conjunction with the company s air transportation product to ambassadair travel club members and to the general public through ata vacations  inc  its tour operator subsidiary 
other revenues 
other revenues increased from million in to million in significant components of the change in other revenue between and include a million reduction in revenues derived from subcontracting the company s aircraft to fly short term substitute service for other airlines  a million increase in administrative ticketing fees charged to scheduled service passengers  a million increase from the onboard sale of liquor and headsets  a million increase in cargo revenues  a million increase from the sale of trip protection insurance to passengers purchasing tour packages  a million increase in commissions earned for the sale of car rentals  and a million increase in excess baggage fees 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased from million in to million in operating expense increases were principally due to increases in scheduled service capacity  traffic and passengers boarded between years which affected most expense categories 
operating cost per asm increased from cents in to cents in this increase in cost per asm generally reflects growth in the distribution costs of single seat sales such as travel agency commissions and crs fees  salaries and benefits  fuel and oil  aircraft handling and facility rents  partially offset by reductions in the cost per asm of aircraft rentals  passenger service  ground package cost  and other operating expenses 
there was no change in cost per asm between years for aircraft maintenance materials and repairs  crew and other employee travel  and advertising 
salaries  wages and benefits 
this expense increased from million in to million in the majority of the increase was due to the addition of new employees primarily cockpit and cabin crew  base station  maintenance and reservations staff to support the growth in scheduled service and the addition of new aircraft to the company s fleet 
the company recorded additional vacation accrual costs of million in to recognize the phased implementation of a new vacation policy which became applicable to most employees during the company also recorded variable compensation costs in association with higher profits which were not incurred in these additional benefit and compensation costs contributed to a increase in the cost per asm from cents in to cents in the company implemented a collective bargaining agreement with flight attendants in december  at which time this employee group received a base pay rate increase of approximately  together with some adjustments to variable pay factors 
in december  the company reached a tentative agreement with cockpit crews on a collective bargaining agreement covering that group of employees 
in february of  the company was notified that the cockpit crews had failed to ratify the tentative agreement 
a new tentative four year collective bargaining agreement was reached with cockpit crews on august   which was subsequently ratified by the international brotherhood of teamsters membership on september  fuel and oil 
the cost of fuel and oil increased from million in to million in although the average price paid for fuel was slightly higher in  this unfavorable price effect was partially offset by the fact that a larger proportion of the block hours in were flown by the more fuel efficient boeing fleet 
total block hours flown increased from  hours in to  hours in the company s boeing fleet accounted for of block hours in  as compared to in the less fuel efficient lockheed l fleet accounted for of block hours  as compared to in block hours for the boeing fleet were also lower in  accounting for of block hours as compared to in effective october   the company became subject to a cent per gallon excise tax on jet fuel consumed for domestic use by commercial air carriers 
the effect of this tax in the fourth quarter of was to increase the company s cost of fuel subject to this tax by approximately  which added million to total fuel and oil expense in the fourth quarter of the fuel tax caused the company s cost per asm for fuel and oil to increase by to cents from cents in handling  landing and navigation fees 
handling  landing and navigation fees increased from million in to million in most of this increase was attributable to a increase in the total number of departures between years  from  in to  in the average cost per departure declined in as compared to because each airport served by the company has a different schedule of fees including variable prices for different aircraft types  average departure costs are a function of the mix of airports served and the fleet composition of departing aircraft 
on average  operations to international airports are more expensive per departure than for us domestic airports 
in  the share of the company s departures which operated from international airports declined from to because the company s growth in was concentrated mostly in domestic scheduled service markets 
the cost per asm for handling  landing and air navigation fees increased from cents in to cents in this increase resulted from a small decline in the average number of asms per departure between years and is indicative of the growing proportion of departures which employ the company s smaller capacity boeing and boeing aircraft rather than the larger lockheed l wide body 
in  the percentage of departures made with narrow body aircraft increased to  as compared to in aircraft rentals 
aircraft rental expense increased from million in to million in this increase in expense was due to the addition of leased lockheed l  boeing and boeing aircraft into the company s fleet during  offset partially by reduced lease costs on certain boeing aircraft under terms of operating leases renegotiated in late  and by the purchase of four previously leased pratt whitney engines 
aircraft rental cost per asm decreased from cents in to cents in the year over year benefit realized from boeing operating lease renegotiations in late was a significant factor in this change since the ownership costs of each boeing aircraft are comparatively higher than for the company s other fleet types 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in to million in the cost per asm increased from cents in to cents in depreciation expense increased approximately million in as compared to due to the addition of one lockheed l and four pratt whitney engines  together with the purchase of other property  furniture and equipment to support the company s growth in operations 
amortization of airframe and engine overhauls increased million in as compared to  net of million in overhaul credits earned by the company under an engine purchase agreement with rolls royce commercial aero engines limited 
the increasing cost of amortization expense reflects the recent increase in the number of aircraft added to the company s fleet 
new aircraft introduced into the fleet generally do not require airframe or engine overhauls until as many as or more months after first entering service 
therefore  resulting amortization of these overhauls generally occurs on a delayed basis from the date the aircraft is placed into service 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
the cost of maintenance  materials and repairs increased from million in to million in the cost per asm remained unchanged at cents for both and the cost of the company s maintenance  materials and repairs increased in at approximately the same rate as the increase in asms between years and slightly slower than the increase in block hours 
the more favorable comparison to block hours between years is indicative of the faster growth in the twin engine boeing fleet  which is also composed of newer and more technologically advanced aircraft which require relatively less routine maintenance than the company s older three engine lockheed l and boeing fleets 
the boeing fleet accounted for of block hours in  as compared to in all of the company s aircraft under operating leases have certain return conditions applicable to the maintenance status of airframes and engines as of the termination of the lease 
the company accrues estimated return condition costs as a component of maintenance  materials and repairs expense based upon the actual condition of the aircraft as each lease termination date approaches 
return condition expenses accrued in were million less than in  primarily due to a change in return conditions negotiated on certain boeing aircraft leases in late crew and other employee travel 
the cost of crew and other employee travel increased from million in to million in the cost per asm remained unchanged at cents for both years 
passenger service 
the most significant portion of this cost is catering  which represented and  respectively  of total passenger service expense in and the cost of passenger service increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to the increase in the total number of passengers boarded from million in to million in the cost of passenger service increased less rapidly than the increase in passengers boarded due to a reduction in catering service levels in select charter and scheduled service markets beginning late in the second quarter of in addition to this planned reduction in catering  the reduction in military passengers boarded between years also reduced the average cost of catering since military catering is one of the most expensive per passenger in the company s business mix 
the cost per asm of passenger service declined from cents in to cents in this reduction was primarily due to reduced catering costs  as the cost per asm of the total of other components of passenger service did not change materially between years 
commissions 
commissions expense increased from million in to million in the cost of commissions per asm increased from cents in to cents in scheduled service commissions expense accounted for all of the increase in this cost in  which was consistent with the significant growth in commissionable scheduled service sold by travel agencies 
the average rate of commission paid to travel agencies declined slightly between years due to the elimination of selected sales incentives 
the average percentage of revenues sold by travel agencies increased between years due to the company s implementation of full participation in several crss in the third quarter of and because of the introduction of connecting fares in the second quarter of which offered significantly expanded ata schedule choices to travel agencies 
commissions paid for military flying were reduced in due to the reduction in military departures between years 
commissions paid for tour operator departures also declined slightly between years 
ground package cost 
ground package cost for increased from million in to million in the cost per asm declined from cents in to cents in the cost per asm declined between years due to the slower growth in ground package sales as compared to overall growth in the company s capacity as measured by asms 
the cost of ground accommodations sold to ambassadair and ata vacations customers increased in some markets in  resulting in slightly lower gross margins in as compared to other selling expenses 
other selling expenses are comprised primarily of fees paid to crs and the cost of inbound reservations lines provided for the use of the company s customers 
these costs increased from million in to million in and were generally incurred to support the sale of scheduled services 
other selling cost per asm increased from cents in to cents in scheduled service passengers boarded increased from million to million over the same comparative period  while scheduled service asms increased from billion to billion between years 
the company participates in sabre as a multi host user and is also displayed in galileo  worldspan and system one 
these crss  which display competitive schedules and fares for all participating airlines  offer different levels of services at different transaction costs 
in order to expand the company s visibility of schedules and fares with travel agencies  the company s crs service levels were increased in all of these systems effective in july  resulting in a significant increase in billable transactions and higher transaction rates 
although the company believes that crs participation has been essential to rapid development of name recognition and sales in the company s new markets  more economic scheduled service distribution alternatives to crss are now being evaluated 
advertising 
advertising expense for increased from million in to million in the cost per asm remained unchanged between years at cents 
the company incurs advertising costs primarily to support scheduled service sales 
scheduled service asms increased in compared to  and the cost of advertising per scheduled service asm declined from cents in to cents in facilities and other rentals 
the cost of facilities and other rents increased from million in to million in the cost per asm increased from cents in to cents in the significant portion of growth in facilities leasing has originated from the expansion of scheduled services  which has required the company to add new leased facilities at airport locations to accommodate the space needs of airport passenger service and maintenance staff 
the rate of increase in facilities costs between years has been slightly lower than the rate of increase in scheduled service asms since the utilization of the company s facilities has improved with expanded scheduled service frequencies at certain airports 
other expenses 
other expenses increased from million in to million in the cost per asm for other expenses declined from cents in to cents in significant components of the increase of million in other expenses between years include million in additional general  hull and liability insurance expense associated with the company s expanded size and flying activity  million in additional property and sales taxes assessed on the company s expanding asset base and purchasing activity  and million in additional communications costs related to the company s data network infrastructure for worldwide airport operations 
in  the company recognized a gain of million on a transaction with the city of indianapolis involving the company s headquarters facility 
there was no comparable gain recognized in income tax expense income tax expense increased from million in to million in the effective income tax rates were and for and  respectively 
income tax expense increased in close proportion to the increase in taxable income between years 
the effective tax rate for included a more significant negative impact from non deductible crew per diem expense than did however  this effect was more than offset by the tax benefit of adjustments in state tax rates and other tax reserve adjustments recognized in that year 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow 
the company has historically financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements from cash flow from operations and long term borrowings from banks and other lenders 
for  and  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million  respectively  for  and such amounts primarily reflected cash capital expenditures totaling million in  million in  and million in for engine overhauls  airframe improvements and the purchase of airframes  engines and rotable parts 
these capital expenditures were supplemented with other capital expenditures  financed directly with debt  totaling million and million  respectively  in and net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million  and million  respectively  for  and aircraft and fleet adjustments 
in september  the company entered into an agreement to lease four additional lockheed l aircraft and two new boeing aircraft 
one lockheed l was delivered in november  and the remaining lockheed l aircraft were delivered during the second quarter of the company purchased one of the three lockheed l s it was obligated to lease during the second quarter of the company completed delivery of one boeing in the fourth quarter of  and the remaining boeing was delivered in october  in november  the company signed a purchase agreement for six new boeing s which  as subsequently amended  provides for aircraft to be delivered between and in conjunction with the boeing purchase agreement  the company entered into a separate agreement with rolls royce commercial aero engines limited for thirteen rb e engines to power the six boeing aircraft and to provide one spare engine 
under the rolls royce agreement  which became effective january   rolls royce has provided the company various spare parts credits and engine overhaul cost guarantees 
if the company does not take delivery of the engines  the credits and cost guarantees that have been used are required to be refunded to rolls royce 
the aggregate purchase price under these two agreements is approximately million per aircraft  subject to escalation 
the company accepted delivery of the first aircraft under these agreements in september  and the second aircraft in december the company accepted delivery of the third and fourth aircraft under these agreements in november and december all four deliveries in and were financed under leases accounted for as operating leases 
the final two deliveries under this agreement are scheduled for the fourth quarters of and advance payments and interest totaling approximately million million per aircraft are required prior to delivery of the two remaining aircraft  with the remaining purchase price payable at delivery 
as of december   and  the company had made million  million  and million  respectively  in advance payments and interest applicable to aircraft scheduled for future delivery 
the company intends to finance future deliveries under this agreement through sale leaseback transactions accounted for as operating leases 
in the fourth quarter of  the company purchased one boeing and financed that aircraft through a sale leaseback accounted for as an operating lease 
in the first quarter of  the company purchased four additional boeing aircraft  financing all of these through sale leasebacks accounted for as operating leases by the end of the third quarter of in the second quarter of  the company purchased a sixth boeing aircraft which had been previously financed by the company through a lease accounted for as an operating lease 
this aircraft was financed through a separate bridge debt facility as of december   but is expected to be financed long term through a sale leaseback transaction 
in october  the company entered into an agreement with a supplier to provide for the purchase of hushkits for installation on boeing aircraft 
all six boeing aircraft acquired during the fourth quarter of and the first two quarters of had hushkits installed  and the company installed hushkits on two other existing boeing aircraft in the company s fleet by the end of these narrow body hushkitted aircraft maintain the company s compliance with federal stage noise requirements for the fleet as of december  the cost of these hushkits was included in the basis of each modified boeing as these aircraft were financed long term through sale leaseback transactions 
on july   the company entered into a letter of intent with a major lessor to cancel several boeing and lockheed l operating aircraft leases then in effect 
under the terms of the letter of intent  the company canceled leases on five boeing aircraft powered by pratt whitney engines and returned these aircraft to the lessor by the end of the company was required to meet certain return conditions associated with several aircraft  such as providing maintenance checks to airframes 
the lessor reimbursed the company for certain leasehold improvements made to some aircraft and credited the company for certain prepayments made in earlier years to satisfy qualified maintenance expenditures for several aircraft over their original lease terms 
the cancellation of these leases reduced the company s fleet of pratt whitney powered boeing aircraft from seven to two units as of the end of the company also agreed to terminate existing operating leases on three lockheed l aircraft  and to purchase the airframes pertaining to these aircraft while signing a new lease covering only the nine related engines  the lockheed l transaction was not completed before the end of in association with this letter of intent  the lessor provided the company with approximately million in additional unsecured financing for a term of seven years 
this transaction accounted for million of the million loss on disposal of assets recorded in the third quarter of see disposal of assets 
the company also agreed to purchase one rolls royce powered boeing aircraft from the same lessor in the fourth quarter of this was not completed and the aircraft was acquired through the lessor on a short term rental agreement 
the acquisition of this aircraft  together with the delivery of two new rolls royce powered boeing aircraft from the manufacturer in the fourth quarter of  and the return of the last two pratt whitney powered boeing aircraft discussed in the next paragraph  reduced the company s rolls royce powered boeing fleet to seven units as of the end of in september  the company began negotiations with a major lessor to cancel existing operating leases on the company s remaining two pratt whitney powered boeing aircraft 
these aircraft were returned to the lessor by the end of this transaction accounted for million of the million loss on disposal of assets provided for in the third quarter of credit facilities 
the company s existing bank credit facility provides a maximum of million  including a million letter of credit facility  subject to the maintenance of certain collateral value 
the collateral for the facility consists of certain owned lockheed l aircraft  certain receivables  and certain rotables and spare parts 
at december   and  the company had borrowed the maximum amount then available under the bank credit facility  of which million was repaid on january   million was repaid on january   and million was repaid on january  as a result of the company s need to restructure its scheduled service business  the company renegotiated certain terms of the bank credit facility effective september  the new agreement also modified certain loan covenants to take into account the expected losses in the third and fourth quarters of in return for this covenant relief  the company agreed to implement changes to the underlying collateral for the facility and to change the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the facility 
the company has pledged additional owned engines and equipment as collateral for the facility as of the implementation date of the new agreement 
the company has further agreed to reduce the million of available credit secured by the owned lockheed l fleet by million per month from april through september  and by million per month from october through april loans outstanding under the renegotiated facility bear interest  at the company s option  at either i prime to prime plus  or ii the eurodollar rate plus to 
the facility matures on april   and contains various covenants and events of default  including maintenance of a specified debt to equity ratio and a minimum level of net worth  achievement of a minimum level of cash flow  and restrictions on aircraft acquisitions  liens  loans to officers  change of control  indebtedness  lease commitments and payment of dividends 
at december   the company has reclassified million of bank credit facility borrowings from long term debt to current maturities of long term debt 
of this amount  million is attributable to the scheduled reduction of availability secured by the owned lockheed l fleet during the months ending december  the remaining million represents the amount of the spare pratt whitney engines which are pledged to the bank facility and which will be repaid from the anticipated sale 
the net book value of these spare engines  which approximates estimated market value  is classified as assets held for sale in the accompanying balance sheet 
the company also maintains a million revolving credit facility available for its short term borrowing needs and for securing the issuance of letters of credit 
borrowings against this credit facility bear interest at the lender s prime rate plus per annum 
there were no borrowings against this facility as of december  or  however  the company did have outstanding letters of credit secured by this facility aggregating million and million  respectively 
stock repurchase program 
in february  the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
during  the company repurchased  shares  bringing the total number of shares it has repurchased under the program to  shares 
the company does not currently expect to complete this stock repurchase program 
other significant matters in august  the city of indianapolis and the state of indiana agreed upon a package of economic incentives to be provided to the company in exchange for the company s commitment to maintain existing operations in indiana and to increase overall employment within the company s indiana operations 
the company presently maintains in indiana its corporate headquarters  a significant maintenance and engineering operation  and a reservations center  together with other smaller operational units of the company 
forward looking information information contained within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking information which can be identified by forward looking terminology such as believes  expects  may  will  should  anticipates  or the negative thereof  or other variations in comparable terminology 
such forward looking information is based upon management s current knowledge of factors affecting the company s business 
the differences between expected outcomes and actual results can be material  depending upon the circumstances 
therefore  where the company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results in any forward looking information  such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and is believed to have a reasonable basis  but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will result or will be achieved or accomplished 
taking into account the foregoing  the company has identified the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by the company the restructuring of the company s scheduled service operations has resulted in significant operating and net losses for the third and fourth quarters of and has imposed higher fixed costs on the traditionally profitable charter business segment of the company 
future actions of the company s competitors  or unfavorable future economic conditions  such as high fuel prices or a sustained reduction in demand for the company s services  could render such restructuring insufficient to return the company to sustained profitability 
at various times during  the company has actively considered possible business combinations with other air carriers 
the company intends to continue to evaluate such potential combinations  and it is possible that the company will enter into a transaction in that would result in a merger or other change in control of the company 
the company s current credit facility may be accelerated upon such a merger or consolidation  in which case there can be no assurance that the company would have sufficient liquidity to complete such a transaction or to secure alternative financing 
the company s capital structure remains subject to significant financial leverage  which could impair the company s ability to obtain new or additional financing for working capital and capital expenditures  and could increase the company s vulnerability to a sustained economic downturn 
under the terms of certain financing agreements  the company is required to maintain compliance with certain specified covenants  restrictions  financial ratios  and other financial and operating tests 
the company s ability to comply with any of the foregoing restrictions and with loan repayment provisions will depend upon its future profit and loss performance and financial position  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors  including some factors entirely beyond the control of the company 
a failure to comply with any of these obligations could result in an event of default under one or more such financing agreements  which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of certain of the company s debt  as well as the possible termination of aircraft operating leases 
such an event could result in a materially adverse effect on the company s financial position 
the company has significant net operating loss carryforwards and investment and other tax credit carryforwards which may  depending upon the circumstances  be available to reduce future federal income taxes payable 
if the company undergoes an ownership change within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code  the company s potential future utilization of its net operating loss carryforwards and investment tax credit carryforwards could be impaired 
the actual effect of this impairment on the company would depend upon a number of factors  including the profitability of the company and the timing of the sale of certain assets  some of which factors are beyond the control of the company 
the impact on the company of such a limitation could be materially adverse under certain circumstances 
the vast majority of the company s scheduled service and charter business  other than us military  is leisure travel 
since leisure travel is often discretionary spending on the part of the company s customers  the company s results of operations can be adversely affected by economic conditions which reduce discretionary purchases 
the company is subject to the risk that one or more customers who have contracted with the company will cancel or default on such contracts and that the company might be unable in such circumstances to obtain other business to replace the resulting loss in revenues 
the company s largest single customer is the us military  which accounted for approximately of operating revenues in no other single customer of the company accounts for more than of operating revenues 
over two thirds of the company s operating revenues are sold by travel agents and tour operators  who generally have a choice of airlines when booking a customer s travel 
although the company intends to offer attractive and competitive products to travel agents and tour operators  and further intends to maintain favorable relationships with them  any significant actions by large numbers of travel agencies or tour operators to favor other airlines  or to disfavor the company  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has faced intensified competition in from other airlines in many of its scheduled service markets  including other low fare airlines 
the future actions of existing and potential competitors in all of the company s business segments  including changes in prices and seat capacity offered in individual markets  could have a material effect on the profit performance of those business segments of the company 
jet fuel comprises a significant percentage of the total operating expenses of the company  accounting for and  respectively  of operating expenses in and fuel prices are subject to factors which are beyond the control of the company  such as market supply and demand conditions  and political or economic factors 
although the company is able to contractually pass through some fuel price increases to the us military and to tour operators  a significant increase in fuel prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating performance 
the company believes that its relations with employee groups are good 
however  the existence of a significant labor dispute with any sizable group of employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company is subject to regulation under the jurisdictions of the department of transportation and the federal aviation administration  and by certain other governmental agencies 
these agencies propose and issue regulations from time to time which can significantly increase the cost of airline operations 
for example  the faa has issued regulations imposing standards on airlines for the limitation of engine noise and standards to address aging aircraft maintenance procedures 
the company could become subject to new future regulations which could impose new and significant operating costs on the company 
a modification  suspension or revocation of the company s dot or faa authorizations or certificates could have a material adverse affect on the company
