backlog for scaffolding  shoring and forming equipment  and for roofing granules and slag abrasives are not included in the infrastructure and construction group s total backlog  because they are generally not quantifiable 
contracts for the metal reclamation and mill services group are also excluded from the total backlog 
these contracts  having an estimated value of more than billion at year end  extending into the year  increased approximately over december  outlook for the progress made in  with upward trends in sales  income  and backlogs underpins our view that harsco s core businesses will continue to grow in we expect metal reclamation and mill services to expand further in  with both new customers and broader product service offerings to existing customers 
this revenue growth combined with ongoing cost saving and productivity initiatives  should again yield improved results 
we expect to offer more scaffolding services to the construction and industrial maintenance markets  as we open five more branches in addition to the eight opened in  and broaden the introduction of our new sprint scaffolding line 
further  we anticipate the expansion of services in the railway maintenance of way equipment market  led by a broadening of our tie masters program and r d efforts 
the refocusing of the company  begun in  shifting the emphasis to industrial services  in contrast to our past primary focus on manufacturing  will continue 
we anticipate growth from our manufacturing businesses  led by the expansion of the product offerings of our gas containment and process equipment businesses internationally 
capital expenditures could exceed s record million level  as we further pursue internal growth opportunities 
achievement of this sales and income growth plan should more than offset the anticipated decline of our defense industry partnership equity income in subject to major economic  political and foreign currency changes  we believe that our operations will achieve our goals for increased returns on capital  assets and equity 
cash flows from operating activities are expected to approximate s 
we expect to further improve our debt to capital ratio  excluding the impact of major acquisitions  and fulfill our other stated financial objectives  while investing appropriately for sustainable growth in our businesses
