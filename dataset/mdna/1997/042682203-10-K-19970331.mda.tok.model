item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
amounts reported here have been rounded to the nearest thousand  unless such amounts are more than million  in which event such amounts have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand 
general from its inception  the company has been engaged principally in the research  design  development and commercialization of an advanced zinc air battery system for powering zero emission electric vehicles 
the electric fuel system consists of a refuelable zinc air battery comprised of a series of cells with removable zinc anode cassettes  a battery refueling system for refueling the depleted fuel cassettes  a battery exchange system and a regeneration system for recycling the depleted cassettes 
the company continues to develop and engineer all components of the electric fuel system  currently primarily for use in the field test  as well as in connection with its other strategic alliances 
during  in addition to implementing the company s electric vehicle programs  the company has begun to actively expand its activities in non electric vehicle applications for its zinc air battery technology 
the company is currently developing a battery for torpedoes  has developed and is selling a signal light powered by water activated batteries for use in life jackets and other rescue apparatus and is exploring the market for batteries for hand held electronic devices 
it is expected that the company will continue to expand its efforts with respect to these other applications 
the company has experienced significant fluctuations in the sources and amounts of its revenues and expenses  and the company believes that the following comparisons of results of operations for the periods presented do not provide a meaningful indication of the development of the company 
during these periods  the company has received periodic lump sum payments relating to licensing and other revenues from deutsche post in connection with the field test  the israel electric company  and from edison  which have been based on the achievement of certain milestones  rather than ratably over time 
the company s expenses have been based upon meeting the contractual requirements under its agreements with various strategic partners and  therefore  have varied according to the timing of activities  such as the need to provide prototype products and to establish and engineer refueling and regeneration facilities 
the company s research and development expenses have been offset  to some extent  by the periodic receipt of research grants from the chief scientist 
the company expects that  because of these and other factors  including general economic conditions and delays due to legislation and regulatory and other processes and the development of competing battery technologies  future results of operations may not be meaningfully compared with those of other periods 
thus  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its past results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the company incurred significant operating losses for the years ended december   and  and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses over the next several years 
these losses may increase and be incurred over a longer period of time as the company expands its research and development activities and establishes production and regeneration facilities  and such losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
however  if the electric fuel system is successfully commercialized  the company expects to derive revenues from the sale of components of the electric fuel system manufactured by the company  including electric fuel  and from licensing rights to the electric fuel system to third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever derive such revenues or achieve profitability 
functional currency the company s management considers the united states dollar to be the currency of the primary economic environment in which efl operates and  therefore  efl has adopted and is using the united states dollar as its functional currency 
further  the company believes that the operations of efl s subsidiaries are an integral part of the israeli operations 
while a growing proportion of efl s revenues have been denominated in deutsche marks as a result of its involvement in the field test  based on the company s historical experience and the company s strategic objectives  management continues to consider the united states dollar to be the currency of the primary economic environment in which efl operates  and the company does not believe that any change in this condition would have a material impact on the analysis of the company s historical financial condition and results of operations 
transactions and balances originally denominated in united states dollars are presented at the original amounts 
gains and losses arising from non dollar transactions and balances are included in net income

results of operations years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   totaled million compared with million in the comparable period in  an increase of million 
revenues for were principally derived from activities relating to the field test program 
the balance of the revenues related to the field test are expected to be recognized in the company also recognized revenues in connection with the granting of a license to the israel electric company for zinc air battery refueling and regeneration in israel and other neighboring countries 
additionally  the company completed recognition of revenues related to phase of its development program with stn atlas elektronik gmbh stn to develop a high power zinc oxygen battery for torpedoes  and began recognition of revenues from phase of its stn program 
finally  the company recognized revenues from edison in connection with the license granted to it 
revenues for the year ended december   were principally derived from activities relating to the field test  and a grant of marketing rights and the sale of equipment to vattenfall ab when vattenfall and the swedish post joined the field test as associate partners 
in addition  revenues related to phase of the company s agreement with stn and the completion and delivery of all of the company s outstanding orders from edison were recognized in research and development expenses and cost of revenues totalled million during compared with million during however actual research and development expenses and cost of revenues of million were offset by million  representing utilization of a portion of the previously accrued provision for project losses 
these expenses for both and include expenses in connection with the field test  including costs related to construction of the bremen regeneration facility and battery production costs  costs associated with the operation of the company s production facilities in israel  and the continued development and engineering costs relating to the electric fuel system 
the company believes that  given the company s stage of development  it is not  at this time  meaningful to distinguish between research and development expenses and cost of revenues 
in the year ended december   the company recorded million of royalty bearing grants representing substantially all of the expected grants from the chief scientist in connection with the company s research and development program  including an increase of  in chief scientist grants in connection with the company s research and development program 
for the year ended december   the company recorded million of chief scientist grants 
expenses related to the field test are expected to continue to be incurred through as the company continues to deliver batteries and operates the bremen regeneration plant 
field test expenses have substantially exceeded any expected revenues related thereto 
since the plant is currently dedicated to the field test  the cost of the plant net of anticipated residual value is reflected as a current expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to million compared with million in this increase was attributable to the following increased salaries  fees and allocated overhead expenses with respect to the company s expanded activities  particularly in germany  a settlement arrangement with respect to a terminated consultant included in marketing expenses see note a to the consolidated financial statements  increased severance accruals resulting from modifications to certain named executive officers employment agreements  and increased costs as the company intensified its marketing efforts into new geographic areas

selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased to million compared with million in selling  general and administrative expenses for included a royalty accrual to the chief scientist of million  resulting  without reflecting the royalty accrual  in a net increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  in this increase was attributable to increased costs as the company intensified its marketing efforts in to new geographic areas  provided administrative support for the company s expanded activities  and continued to develop its managerial infrastructure to meet its growth requirements 
management currently estimates the total program losses related to the field test to approximate million and  at december   the provision for anticipated program losses on the uncompleted portions of the program amounted to million 
accordingly  the financial statements reflect a million net increase in the provision for anticipated program losses from million recorded in this provision  in addition to the provision recorded in  reflects anticipated losses from the field test based on the most recent estimates of costs related to the field test  and may be offset by future revenues or increased to reflect any future revised estimates of project costs 
the overall increase to the provision includes revised cost estimates based on the company s production experience to date for the supply of the battery vehicle interface equipment  batteries  the estimated service expenses for the field test fleet and the kg hour regeneration plant being built in bremen  germany 
since the plant is currently dedicated to the field test  the cost of the plant net of anticipated residual value is reflected as a current expense 
financial income  net of interest expense  bank charges  and other fees  totaled approximately  in compared to  in financial income reflects primarily interest earned on united states tax exempt securities  which increased to  in from  in the company has incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during the years ended december  and and  accordingly  no provision for income taxes was required

however  in connection with the company s discussions with the deutsche post with respect to the opel batteries  the company has reduced anticipated revenues related to the supply of opel batteries from its budgeted field test revenues  resulting in a reduction of anticipated net project revenues to dm million approximately million 
battery and vehicle deliveries for mercedes benz participation in the field test are expected to continue into the company currently anticipates that deliveries of opel batteries will be reduced to support five vehicles in under the currently anticipated project scope  and after the revenue reduction related to the opel batteries  the company has recognized to date approximately million of the field test revenues 
the remaining revenues and expenses related to the field test are expected to be recognized during the company expects that  in connection with its ongoing efforts in the engineering and commercialization of the electric fuel system  the company s research and development  operational and selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase 
as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million compared with million as of december  the company used available funds during primarily for the advancement of its commitments with regard to the field test  continued research and development expenditures and other working capital needs 
the company increased its investments in fixed assets by to million during fixed assets include million related to the residual value of the bremen facility after its use in the field test  based on construction costs to date 
the company currently anticipates that the total residual value of the bremen facility will be approximately million 
in the first quarter of  the company completed a public offering of  shares of its common stock at an offering price of per share 
the offering resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
also during the first quarter of  the company s israeli subsidiary  electric fuel ltd 
efl  established a line of credit with the first international bank of israel ltd 
fibi the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at fibi s prime rate per annum  be unconditionally guaranteed by electric fuel corporation efc and be secured by a pledge of foreign currency deposits in the amount of nis  approximately 
additionally the credit facility imposes financial and other covenants on efc and efl and presently expires on july   at which time the credit facility will be reviewed for renewal by fibi 
the credit facility provides efl with a line of credit in the maximum principal amount of nis million approximately million  which is expected to be used as credit support for various obligations of the company  and will enable efl to enter into up to us million in currency hedging forward contracts with a collateral requirement 
as of december  the bank had issued letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling approximately  at the present time  the company is not engaged in any hedging activities 
pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated september  between the company and mr 
leon gross  one of the company s existing shareholders  on october   the company issued  shares of the company s common stock  
par value per share  to mr 
gross at a price of per share 
the offering resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
as a result of this transaction  and following other open market purchases  approximately of the stock of the company s israeli based subsidiary  efl  is now owned directly  indirectly or by application of certain attribution rules by three united states citizens 
if of the shares of the company is ever acquired or deemed to be acquired by five or fewer individuals including  if applicable  those individuals who currently own an aggregate of of the company who are united states citizens or residents  efl would satisfy the foreign personal holding company fphc stock ownership test under the internal revenue code and the company could be subject to additional us taxes on any undistributed fphc income of efl 
for  efl has not had  income which would qualify as undistributed fphc income 
however  no assurance can be given that in the future efl will not have income which qualifies as undistributed fphc income 
the company currently has no long term debt outstanding and expects that its cash flow from operations  cash reserves and amounts available under the credit facility  will be sufficient to fund the company s projected activities through the second quarter of however  costs related to the field test have exceeded  and may continue to exceed  budgeted amounts 
while the company is negotiating with the deutsche post for additional funding to support the field test there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any such funding 
moreover  if the field test is successful and deutsche post  or any other participant in the field test  begins to convert all or a portion of their fleets  to the electric fuel system  the company could be required to produce batteries in increased quantities as well as to construct new regeneration and refueling facilities or expand its existing facility to commercial capacity 
additional strategic alliances may also require the establishment or expansion of facilities in israel or elsewhere 
in addition  the company may determine that it should invest in certain programs  such as additional electric vehicle demonstration programs  which it believes will advance the development and commercialization of the electric fuel system 
the company also intends to use its resources to research and develop other applications exploiting its proprietary technology including batteries for portable electronic devices 
accordingly  the company may be required to seek additional funding or pursue other options  such as joint ventures with field test partners or others  during this period 
the company continues to consider financing alternatives when presented and  if financing becomes available on satisfactory terms  including price  the company may obtain additional funding  including through the issuance of equity securities 
actual cash requirements will depend in part upon actual and anticipated sales and licenses 
the company may also be able to finance some portion of its fixed asset and equipment needs through approved enterprise grants from the government of israel 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations historically  the majority of the company s revenues have been in us dollars  although an increasing proportion of the company s revenues are currently in deutsche marks 
most of the company s expenses are measured in dollars and in nis 
the united states dollar cost of the company s operations in israel  with regard to expenses incurred in nis  is influenced by the extent to which an increase in the rate of inflation in israel is not offset by the devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar 
in most recent years  inflation in israel has not been fully compensated by the devaluation of the nis  and  accordingly  the dollar cost of the company s nis expenses has increased 
the company does not believe that continuing inflation in israel or delays in the devaluation of the nis are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company  except in the event that such circumstances have such an impact on israel s economy as a whole 
in the years ended december    and in  the annual rates of inflation in israel were   and  respectively  compared to the devaluation of the nis against the dollar during such periods of    and respectively 
a growing portion of the company s revenues are in deutsche marks 
any decrease in the value of the deutsche mark as against the dollar would result in a decrease in the dollar value of such revenues 
while in the past  the company has engaged in currency hedging  in an effort to decrease the impact of short term currency fluctuations  the company is not currently engaging in currency hedging 
effective corporate tax rate the company s production facilities in israel have been granted approved enterprise status under the israeli law for encouragement of capital investments  the investment law  and consequently are eligible for certain tax benefits for up to ten years after they first generate taxable income provided the maximum period as prescribed by the investment law has not elapsed 
the company has elected to receive a grant of funds together with a reduced tax rate presently for the aforementioned period 
the company s effective corporate tax rate may be affected by the classification of certain items of income as being approved income for purposes of the approved enterprise law  and hence subject to a lower tax rate to  depending on the extent of foreign ownership of efl presently than is imposed on other forms of income under israeli law presently 
the effective tax upon income distributed by the company to its stockholders would be increased as a result of the withholding tax imposed upon dividends distributed by efl to efc  resulting in an overall effective corporate tax rate of approximately for income arising from efl s approved enterprises and regarding other income 
efc and its subsidiaries have incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during the years ended december  and and  accordingly  no provisions for income taxes were required 
tax expense in these years arose primarily from united states alternative minimum taxes 
as of december  the company has us net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  which are available to offset future taxable income  expiring primarily in and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million which are available to offset future taxable income  indefinitely
