since july  the company has bought and sold lpg for distribution into northeast mexico and the us rio grande valley 
in march  the company expanded its operations to include the design  construction  installation and maintenance of turnkey cng fueling stations 
in september  the company commenced limited sales of ppl  purchased from pmi in mexico  to consumers in the united states 
historically  the company has derived substantially all of its revenues from sales to pmi  its primary customer  of lpg purchased from exxon 
in fiscal  the company derived approximately of its revenues from sales of lpg  of which sales to pmi accounted for of total sales 
as part of its business strategy  in march the company acquired certain assets and hired certain former employees from wti  a company engaged in the engineering  design and construction of equipment for turnkey cng fueling stations

the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and is reflected as such in the company s financial statements for fiscal the company provides products and services through a combination of fixed margin and fixed priced contracts 
under the company s agreements with its customers and suppliers  the buying and selling prices of lpg and ppl are based on variable posted prices that provide the company with a fixed margin 
costs included in costs of goods sold other than the purchase price of lpg and ppl may affect actual profits from sales  including costs relating to transportation  storage  leases  maintenance and financing 
the company generally attempts to purchase in volumes commensurate with projected sales 
however  mismatches in volumes and prices of lpg purchased from exxon and resold to pmi could result in unanticipated costs 
the company s cng revenues are principally derived from contracts awarded on a fixed price  as completed basis 
in competing for contracts to construct cng fueling stations or components thereof  the company normally must submit bids for specific projects 
the company s ability to achieve a profit margin for a specific project is dependent on the accuracy of its assessment of the costs associated with that project
