item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained elsewhere herein 
since the operations of wickes are consolidated with those of the company and its subsidiaries for the third and fourth quarters of and accounted for on the equity method for prior periods  comparisons between periods may not be meaningful in certain respects 
liquidity and capital resources the parent company the parent company s general liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds for payment of debt and related interest  and for operating expenses 
operations  exclusive of wickes which is currently prohibited from paying dividends by reason of restrictions in debt instruments  consist primarily of real estate sales and the operations of wml 
although revenues are increasing for wml the company currently forecasts that these operations will continue to produce negative cash flows through at least through the second quarter of and that these operations alone will not provide sufficient funds for the parent company s total long term liquidity needs 
as a consequence  the parent company will need to obtain significant additional funds through asset sales other than sales of real estate  the proceeds of which are required to be utilized to reduce real estate debt or additional financing to support its operations and service its indebtedness 
the principal assets that could be sold by the parent company are its shares of circle common and preferred stock the circle shares and wickes common stock 
circle has entered into a definitive merger agreement with an unrelated third party pursuant to which the circle shares are to be converted into an aggregate of approximately million in cash 
currently  all of the circle shares are pledged to secure the company s real estate indebtedness to american founders  and only the merger proceeds of circle shares that are released from pledge at the time of the merger and merger proceeds that are subsequently released from pledge would  without american founders consent  be available to the parent company 
the amount of required collateral for this indebtedness is adjusted quarterly and the amount of any excess collateral released 
the company anticipates that circle shares that are to be converted into approximately million in this merger will be released at march   and depending upon certain factors  including the market value of the wickes common stock and the timing and amount of sales of the real estate securing this indebtedness  a significant additional number of circle shares or the merger proceeds thereof could be released in the future 
in addition  the company is currently holding discussions with american founders concerning the release of additional circle shares or merger proceeds in exchange for the pledge of additional shares of wickes common stock 
if this merger is completed on its current terms  and if all of the merger proceeds of the circle shares are available to the company  the company anticipates that it would have sufficient liquidity for its projected needs without additional asset sales or financing through there can be no assurance  however  that this merger will be completed or concerning the amount of the merger proceeds that will be available to the company 
at march   the parent company had  in cash and short term investments 
after payment of the  interest payment due on march  with respect to its subordinated notes due  and pending disposition of the circle shares in the merger described above  the company intends to sell wickes common stock from time to time in sufficient amounts to fund its operating cash needs not supplied by additional financing or from other sources 
at december  the principal amount of the company s real estate debt to american founders was  and the company estimates that principal and interest payment on this debt will be approximately  during and  during the company anticipates that it will complete sufficient sales of the real estate securing this debt to make the required payments 
sales in excess of the required amount are required to be applied to reduction of future amounts payable under this debt 
the  principal of the notes is due in september the company anticipates that to repay this indebtedness it will need to obtain additional funds through borrowings  issuance of debt or equity securities or asset sales 
the ability of wml to attain profitability and provide a positive contribution to the parent company s liquidity depends upon a variety of factors  including the ability to attract qualified loan representatives  market acceptance for its services  the maintenance of an adequate interest spread between its cost of borrowing and rates charged on its construction loans  and the ability to keep its operating costs at an acceptable level 
during  the following transactions also affected liquidity in june  the completion of the circle merger provided net cash of million after payment of million of bank debt  million down payment for real estate  closing expenses and taxes 
the company used million of the proceeds to acquire two million shares of wickes common stock on june  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
in august  the company announced that its board of directors approved a plan to acquire in open market transactions from time to time  up to  shares of the company s common stock 
the company purchased and retired  shares of its common stock during the third quarter of in addition  the company purchased and retired  shares during the first quarter of the company will continue to review the plan in in october  the company paid a cash dividend of approximately 
per share  or an aggregate of approximately  to shareholders of record on october  see item market for registrant s common equity and related matters 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere for a description of certain contingencies 
during  stockholders equity decreased by a net of million primarily as a result of decreases in market value of invested assets of the life insurance subsidiaries of million and the dividend of 
million paid to shareholders on october  forward looking information cautionary statement 
the discussion above of the company s future liquidity needs constitutes forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and is inherently subject to uncertainty as a result of a number of risk factors including  among other things i the future operating results of wml  ii the company s ability to achieve the level of real estate sales required to meet scheduled real estate debt payments  and iii the ability of the company to raise funds through sales of circle shares or wickes common stock 
the future operating results of wml will depend upon  among other things  the factors discussed above 
future real estate sales depend upon a number of factors  including interest rates  general economic conditions  and conditions in the commercial real estate markets in atlanta  georgia  and jacksonville  florida 
as discussed above  although there is currently pending an agreement that would convert the circle shares into approximately million in cash there is no assurance that this transaction will be completed or how many circle shares will be released from pledge 
the company s ability to sell wickes common stock will depend upon  among other things  the public trading price of wickes common stock and  in light of the relatively low public trading volume for wickes common stock  possibly the company s ability to find a buyer or buyers for wickes common stock in a private transaction or otherwise 
wickes wickes principal sources of working capital and liquidity are earnings and borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
wickes primary need for capital resources is to finance inventory and accounts receivabl in  net cash provided by wickes operating activities amounted to million 
this compares favorably with cash provided by operating activities of million in and million in this increase is primarily the result of decreases in accounts receivable and inventory as well as earnings after adjustment for non cash expenses 
a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset these increases 
these funds were used primarily to reduce wickes net borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
wickes management s focus on improving the balance sheet included making significant improvements in the use of working capital 
accounts receivable at the end of were million  or  lower than at year end building centers that were closed at the end of december and during account for approximately million of this reduction 
the remainder is attributed to improved collection practices  especially at building centers that were acquired during  a reduction in the number of accounts with extended terms and improved delinquency 
inventory at the end of was million  or  lower than at year end the primary reason for the decrease in inventory is the closing of building centers since december of the amount of wickes accounts payable on any balance sheet date may vary from the average accounts payable throughout the period due to the timing of payments and will tend to increase or decease in conjunction with an increase or decrease in inventory 
on june   wickes sold to the parent company million newly is sued shares of wickes common stock for million in cash 
in accordance with the terms of wickes revolving credit agreement  upon completion of this transaction million in real estate was released as collateral required under this agreement 
these funds were used to reduce wickes borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
wickes maintained excess availability under its revolving credit facility throughout wickes receivables and inventory typically increase in the second and third quarters of the year due to higher sales in the peak building season 
in the first and second quarters of each year  wickes typically reaches its peak utilization of its revolving credit facility because of the inventory build up needed for the peak building season 
at all times during wickes was in full compliance with all of the requirements contained in its revolving credit agreement 
availability under the revolving credit facility is limited  in the aggregate  to the lesser of million and a borrowing base amount  which is the sum of i between and of eligible accounts receivable plus ii between and of eligible inventory 
at march   wickes had outstanding borrowings of million and unused availability of million under its revolving credit facility 
a second amendment and restatement of the revolving credit agreement  which would include among other things i extension of the life facility until march  ii basis points reductions in the interest rate premiums over libor and over prime  iii modifications to certain financial covenants  and iv a provision for further interest rate premium reductions if certain performance levels are achieved  is expected to be completed in march or early april wickes currently has excess availability under its revolving credit facility and anticipates that funds provided by operations and under this facility will be adequate for wickes future needs 
the revolving credit facility and the trust indenture related to wickes senior subordinated notes contain certain covenants and restrictions 
among other things  the revolving credit facility prohibits non stock dividends  certain investments and other restricted payments by wickes 
the trust indenture generally restricts non stock dividends and other restricted payments by wickes to of cumulative consolidated net income  or if cumulative consolidated net income shall be a loss  minus of such loss  of wickes earned subsequent to october   plus the proceeds of the sale of certain equity securities after such date 
in addition  the trust indenture prohibits non stock dividends and limits other restricted payments while as at present wickes fixed charge coverage ratio is less than or equal to wickes capital expenditures consist primarily of the construction of storage facilities  the remodeling of building centers and component manufacturing facilities  and the purchase of equipment and management information systems 
wickes may also from time to time make expenditures to establish limited sku facilities or to establish or acquire operations to expand or complement its existing operations 
wickes made million in capital expenditures in wickes expects to spend between million and million in these expenditures are expected to be funded by wickes borrowings and its internally generated cash flow 
at december   there were no material commitments for future capital expenditures

income from operations 
wickes operations  as well as those of the building material industry generally  have reflected substantial fluctuations from period to period as a consequence of various factors  including levels of construction activity  general regional and local economic conditions  prices of commodity wood products  interest rates and the availability of credit  all of which are cyclical in nature 
wickes anticipates that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
because a substantial percentage of wickes sales are attributable to building professionals  certain of these factors may have a more significant impact on wickes than on companies more heavily focused on consumers 
wickes first quarter and  frequently  its fourth quarter are adversely affected by weather patterns in the midwest and northeast  which result in seasonal decreases in levels of construction activity in these areas 
the extent of such decreases in activity is a function of the severity of winter conditions 
while wickes experienced a relatively mild first quarter in  severe ice storms in the northeast in  and record setting snow falls throughout the midwest and northeast in january of  have adversely affected construction activity in the first quarter of these years

for additional information on the restructuring and unusual items charge see compared with and note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
in addition  in wickes received insurance premium adjustments from a former insurance carrier in the amount of million and reversed an accrual of million for other disputed insurance premiums with this carrier 
accordingly  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were reduced by million during the first three quarters of and by million in the fourth quarter of wickes has historically generated approximately to of its annual revenues during the first quarter of each year  and wickes has historically recorded a significant net loss for this quarter 
as a result of these seasonal factors  wickes inventories and receivables reach peak levels during the second and third quarters and are generally lower during the first and fourth quarters  depending on sales volume and lumber prices 
this item contains statements which  to the extent that they are not recitations of historical fact  constitute forward looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and are inherently subject to uncertainty 
a number of important factors could cause wickes business and financial results and financial condition to be materially different from those stated in the forward looking statements 
those factors include but are not limited to the seasonal and cyclical factors discussed above in this item and elsewhere in this report  the effects of wickes substantial leverage and competition  the success of wickes operational efforts  and the matters discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
compared with net sales 
wickes net sales for decreased million  or  to million from million in sales for all facilities operated throughout both years same store decreased 
during  wickes experienced a decrease in same store sales to its primary customer segment  the professional home builder  and a increase in same store sales to commercial builders 
the reduction in the number of under performing building centers pursuant to the restructuring plan committed to in december of was the major cause of wickes total sales decline 
pursuant to this plan  wickes closed or consolidated building centers in december and two during during  these closed or consolidated building centers contributed an aggregate of million to total net sales 
severe weather conditions in the first quarter of  together with mild weather in the first quarter of  and a decrease in same store sales staff as part of wickes efforts to better align its costs to its sales volume  were the major factors contributing to the same store sales decline 
the decrease in same store sales occurred most heavily during the first nine months of for this period  same store sales were down  while fourth quarter same store sales were up slightly from the fourth quarter of total housing starts in the united states increased in  and starts in wickes primary markets  the midwest and northeast  increased approximately and  respectively 
nationally  single family housing starts  which generate the majority of wickes sales to building professionals  experienced an increase of in  from million starts in to million starts in in inflation in lumber prices had a negligible effect on sales 
gross profit 
wickes gross profit decreased million to of net sales for compared with of net sales for the primary reason for the decrease in gross profit was the reduction in total sales as a result of wickes program to reduce the number of under performing building centers 
the decline in gross profit as a percent of sales is primarily attributed to wickes continued emphasis on sales to the professional builder  resulting in an increase in the portion of wickes sales comprised of lower margin commodity products  and to a lesser extent a program to reduce the amount of excess and slow moving inventory 
the percent of wickes sales attributable to professional builders increased to for compared with in  and sales attributable to commodity lumber products increased from in to in wickes anticipates that its continued focus on the professional builder will create additional pressure on gross profit margins 
the decline in gross profit as a percent of sales was partially offset by a decrease in the cost associated with physical inventory count adjustments 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
in  wickes sg a decreased as a percent of net sales to compared with of net sales in in  wickes focused substantial efforts on better aligning its sg a expenses to sales volumes and improving the productivity of its existing sales staff in order to improve profitability

the recoveries associated with workers compensation insurance reduced salaries  wages and employee benefits by of sales  and the balance of the recoveries reduced property and casualty insurance  as a percent of sales  by wickes also experienced decreases from to as a percent of sales in postage  communications  office supplies  and marketing expenses which were partially offset by increased delivery costs 
in addition to the reductions in sg a directly related to building center closings  other cost reduction initiatives included a reduction in vehicles and other equipment at continuing operations and various programs to reduce costs associated with wickes corporate headquarters in vernon hills  illinois 
depreciation  goodwill and trademark amortization 
wickes depreciation  goodwill and trademark amortization costs decreased million in compared with the primary reasons for this decrease were a program initiated in early to reduce excess vehicles and equipment and the closing and sale of facilities in conjunction with the plan 
provision for doubtful accounts 
wickes extends credit  generally due on the th day of the month following the sale  to qualified and approved contractors 
wickes provision for doubtful accounts decreased to million or of sales for from million or of sales for much of this decrease is attributable to improved credit policies at centers acquired since and a more selective customer base 
in addition  wickes significantly increased its efforts to collect previously reserved accounts receivable 
the provision attributable to the gerrity lumber acquisition centers improved significantly from to historically wickes provision for doubtful accounts averages approximately of sales 
restructuring and unusual items 
after extensive review of the plan  and changes in business conditions in certain markets in which wickes operates  wickes made adjustments to the plan and incurred other one time costs resulting in a net million charge to results of operations in the fourth quarter of for restructuring and unusual items 
these adjustments included i the determination that three of the centers identified in the plan for closure will remain open  resulting in a million credit to restructuring expense  ii the extension of the plan to include the closing substantially completed by the end of of two building centers not previously included  resulting in a million charge for the write down of assets and liabilities to their net realizable value and a million charge for severance and post employment benefits  iii a million charge for impairment in the carrying value of real estate held for sale at closed centers  and iv a million credit with respect to the resolution of a claim at below the reserved amount 
other operating income 
wickes other operating income increased to million in from million in the increase was the result of an increase in gains reported on the sale of closed facilities  excess vehicles and equipment of approximately million when compared with wickes also reported a million gain as the result of the difference between insured replacement cost and book value as a result of a fire and storm damage at several of wickes building centers 
these gains were partially offset by decreases in services charges for overdue credit accounts of approximately million and closed center rental income and other miscellaneous revenues of million 
interest expense 
wickes interest expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was the result of a decrease in average outstanding debt under wickes revolving line of credit of million partially offset by an increase in the overall effective borrowing rate of basis points 
the decrease in average outstanding debt was due primarily to cash provided by operations  proceeds from the sale of additional common stock and the proceeds from the sale of excess real estate and vehicles 
equity in loss of affiliated company 
during  wickes equity in the losses of riverside international llc was million compared with equity in losses of million during see item business building materials international operations and of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
provision for income taxes 
in  wickes recorded current income tax expense of million compared with million in the and current income tax provisions consist of state and local tax liabilities 
a deferred tax expense of million was also recorded in this expense results from temporary differences in the recognition of certain items of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes 
in a deferred tax benefit of million was recorded primarily due to the recording of a deferred tax asset as a result of the operating loss experienced during  in accordance with fas management has determined  based on the wickes positive earnings growth from through and its expectations for the future  that operating income of wickes will more likely than not be sufficient to recognize fully these net deferred tax assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
net income 
wickes net income was million in  compared with a net loss of million in  an improvement of million 
the primary components of this improvement include a decrease in sg a expense of million  a decrease in restructuring and unusual items expense of million  a decrease in provision for doubtful accounts of million  a decrease in interest expense of million  and an increase in other income of million 
these improvements were partially offset by a decrease in gross profit of million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of million 
compared with net sales 
wickes net sales for decreased million  or  to million from million in the fiscal year consisted of weeks compared with weeks in after adjusting for this additional week of sales in  wickes experienced only a 
million sales decline from sales for all facilities operated throughout both years decreased 
after adjusting for the additional week in the decrease was 
in deflation in lumber prices amounted to approximately as a result of increased production in canadian mills  generated by demand for wood pulp  and a decrease in demand for construction lumber in both the united states and foreign markets 
wickes estimates the decline in wood prices accounted for million in lost sales for  or approximately a decline 
a decline in housing starts in the united states also adversely affected sales 
us bureau of the census data indicated a nation wide decline of approximately and declines in wickes primary markets  the midwest and northeast  of approximately and  respectively 
nationally  single family housing starts experienced a larger decline of in  from million starts in to million starts in while wickes added seven new building centers through acquisition and expansion during  it also closed or consolidated other building centers sixteen of these occurred on december wickes experienced a increase in sales to its primary customer segment  the professional home builder  and a increase in sales to commercial builders 
gross profit 
wickes gross profit decreased million to of net sales for compared with of net sales for wickes estimates that deflation in lumber prices caused approximately million of this decrease  and the additional week of sales in contributed approximately million of additional gross profit in wickes continued emphasis on sales to professional builders and the resulting increased sales of lower margin wood products also contributed to the change 
wickes believes that approximately of the decrease in gross profit percentage was the result of the shift in customer mix from consumer and professional in to consumer and professional in an increase in the percent of sales attributable to commodity lumber and building materials along with customer pricing issues  accounted for the remainder of the variance 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
in  wickes sg a increased as a percent of net sales to compared with of net sales in while new residential construction activity slowed during  expenses were not adjusted quickly enough to match the rate of the decline in residential construction

wickes depreciation  goodwill and trademark amortization costs increased million in compared with depreciation of vehicles and equipment  and amortization of goodwill for acquisitions purchased during the second half of and first half of account for all of the increase 
provision for doubtful accounts 
in  wickes provision for doubtful accounts increased as a percentage of net sales to compared with in approximately million of the million increase is attributable to the gerrity lumber centers 
during the integration of the gerrity lumber centers these centers experienced significant credit losses as they converted to wickes more controlled credit policies
