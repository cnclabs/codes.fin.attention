item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
summary of sales case s sales are derived from the manufacture and distribution of a full line of farm equipment  light and medium sized construction equipment and replacement parts 
in recent years case s sales were derived from the following sources years ended december  farm equipment construction equipment replacement parts total sales sales are affected by worldwide agricultural production and demand  housing starts and other construction levels  commodity prices  government subsidies  weather  interest and exchange rates  industry capacity and equipment levels 
in addition to sales of equipment and parts  revenues include income from the financing of such sales 
case restructuring programs in response to depressed market conditions during the early s  case embarked on two restructuring programs 
the first program  initiated in  resulted in a pre tax charge of million million after tax 
this program has been completed and the intended benefits have been achieved 
while the measures taken by case under the restructuring program resulted in substantial cost reductions  the worldwide farm and construction equipment market continued to deteriorate during at that time  the company determined that major structural and strategic changes were necessary in order to rationalize certain component production operations to reduce the fixed cost portion of the manufacturing process  reduce excess capacity  focus  discontinue or replace unprofitable and noncompetitive product lines  and restructure and refocus product and component parts distribution to strengthen case s competitive position in the global marketplace 
consequently  on march   a comprehensive restructuring program the restructuring program was adopted and resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of million million after tax  which was reflected in case s results 
the million pre tax charge was recorded as a million reduction of net property  plant and equipment  a million reduction of inventory  a million reduction of intangibles and other accounts and a million reserve for the future cost of implementing the various restructuring actions 
an analysis of the restructuring program is summarized in the table below in millions restructuring program and activity activity reserves reserves utilized utilized balance at includes changes balance at includes changes balance at december  currency in december  currency in december  translation estimates translation estimates employee termination payments pension and oprb costs

lease termination payments writedown of assets property  plant and equipment provision for environmental liabilities other assets writedown of inventories costs related to closing selling downsizing existing facilities other costs total restructuring charge the employee termination payments represent the severance payments to reduce personnel by approximately  this reduction is the result of closing and or downsizing manufacturing facilities  the consolidation of six parts distribution locations  the privatization of company owned retail stores in north america  europe and australia and a reduction in related support functions 
the employee termination payments also include minor amounts for other costs such as outplacement services and other benefits and certain contractual obligations under labor agreements 
estimates have been revised in each year to reflect changes in social  political  legal and economic conditions where employment reductions will occur 
in  headcount and cost estimates have been updated to reflect recent negotiations with affected parties 
the pension and other postretirement benefit oprb costs represent curtailments as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and sfas no 
resulting from the termination of employees referred to above 
the subsequent revisions to the original estimate reflect changes in the estimated level of benefits as well as changes in the number of employee terminations anticipated by the company 
lease termination payments represent costs associated with the early termination of existing lease commitments for an abandoned european administrative facility and certain company owned retail stores scheduled to be closed 
the changes in estimates resulted from changes in market conditions where leases are to be terminated 
the writedown of assets represents estimated losses on property  plant and equipment to be incurred upon the sale or abandonment of closed downsized production facilities 
the changes in estimates resulted primarily from updated valuations of properties and equipment to be sold or abandoned as well as from property and equipment actually sold in through during  the company allocated the reserve to the specific assets 
this is shown as a utilization of the reserve in the accompanying table 
environmental costs have been accrued with respect to plants and other facilities where remediation and decommissioning costs will be required if such facilities cease operations 
upon the closing of these facilities  as contemplated by the restructuring program  potential remedial  decommissioning and environmental costs associated with the eventual sale of the facility and or property have been recorded based on current knowledge and regulations 
other assets include the writedown to net realizable value of intangibles  goodwill and other miscellaneous items 
such writedowns were directly associated with the restructuring decision and primarily involve intangibles and goodwill in france and germany 
the writedown of inventories represents the writedown to net realizable value of inventory  materials and parts at those facilities that will be closed or for those products that have been discontinued 
the changes in estimates resulted from revised estimates of the various actions still to be completed 
the costs related to closing selling downsizing existing facilities include the estimated costs to close and or downsize plant locations and six parts distribution locations 
the changes in the reserve resulted from revised estimates of the costs of various actions still to be implemented 
the changes in the reserve reflect increased estimates to close the neuss  germany  plant and the racine  wisconsin  parts depot 
other costs include amounts for incremental legal costs required to support the restructuring projects  personnel transfer costs incurred as a direct result of closing and or downsizing operations and other implementation costs 
other costs also include certain incentives and dealer discounts to close out discontinued product lines 
in and  the changes in estimates resulted primarily from improved market conditions resulting in fewer discounts required to liquidate discontinued products 
in and  the changes in estimates relate primarily to increased costs required to implement remaining actions 
the following restructuring actions were completed by the company in 
during  case sold its racine  wisconsin  parts depot  where case had employed approximately people  and transferred its operations to case s remaining regional depots 

the sale of company owned retail stores has progressed steadily 
at december   case had company owned retail stores  as compared to at december  
case announced its intent to cease engine and component production and close the tractor manufacturing facility in neuss  germany  following the termination of production of the current maxxum r tractor models  which is expected to occur by mid year case closed the foundry located in neuss  germany  in december as of december   case employed approximately  people at the neuss facilities

during  case closed its vierzon  france  facility and transferred loader backhoe production to its crepy  france  facility 
case employed approximately people at the vierzon facility 

case adopted sfas no 
effective january  adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations as impaired assets  as defined  had previously been recorded at fair value 
of the remaining million of restructuring reserves for property  plant and equipment at december   million is attributed to assets that will be held for sale in and million is attributed to assets currently in use that will ultimately be disposed of 
the restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed by december  the company believes that the remaining reserves should be adequate to carry out the remaining activities under the restructuring program 
the company estimates that total cash expenditures of approximately million will be required to implement the restructuring program  of which approximately million has been expended through december  these cash costs do not give effect to cash proceeds generated in the course of implementing the restructuring program 
the company believes that the successful completion of the restructuring program will enhance its pre tax income and pre tax operating cash flow through cost reductions by year end by approximately million annually over cost levels 
the preceding sentence and the cost savings estimates contained herein are forward looking statements  and the actual cost reductions could differ materially based on the factors discussed in this paragraph 
approximately of these cost reductions have been realized through the remaining cost reductions are expected to be realized through a reduction of personnel  elimination of costs directly associated with the manufacture and distribution of discontinued products  a decrease in costs associated with assembly as a result of capacity reductions  reduced depreciation expense and the purchase of components at prices lower than the costs that would have been incurred to manufacture them 
the company s estimates of annual cost savings from the foregoing are based on the timely implementation of activities already identified by the company and the achievement of projected levels of unit production and operating efficiency 
the restructuring program is highly complex  and effective implementation continues to be a major undertaking 
while the company is committed to successfully completing the restructuring program  there can be no assurance that all of the objectives of the restructuring program or the company s estimates of annual savings will be achieved 
the specific restructuring measures and associated estimated costs were based on management s best business judgment under prevailing circumstances and on assumptions that have been and may continue to be revised over time and as circumstances change 
as of december   the expected benefits from the restructuring actions are generally as originally contemplated

all of these factors  together with billion in government farm subsidies forecasted by the united states department of agriculture for  will give farmers the ability to invest in new products and new technology to increase productivity 
the construction equipment sector is gaining strength in the united kingdom and australia  while maintaining favorable levels in north america 
housing starts are generally increasing in these markets 
however  elsewhere in europe  the company believes that france and germany could continue to experience significant weakness until economic growth and construction spending resume 
in latin america  economic conditions in brazil have greatly improved and retail sales of construction equipment are expected to be stronger 
consistent with  case anticipates that unit production and wholesale sales will be at or below retail demand for all of as part of the company s continuing supply chain management initiative 
moreover  in the first quarter of  preparation for significant new product introductions will result in lower production of certain of the company s products than in the first quarter of  with no adverse impact expected on full year production schedules 
the information included in this outlook section represents forward looking statements and involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
the company s outlook is predominantly based on its interpretation of what it considers key economic assumptions 
crop production and commodity prices are strongly affected by weather and can fluctuate significantly 
housing starts and other construction activity are sensitive to interest rates and government spending 
some of the other significant factors for the company include general economic conditions  the cyclical nature of its business  foreign currency movements  the company s access to credit  political uncertainty and civil unrest in various areas of the world  pricing  product initiatives and other actions taken by competitors  disruptions in production capacity  excess inventory levels  the effect of changes in laws and regulations including government subsidies and international trade regulations  changes in environmental laws and employee relations 
further information concerning factors that could significantly impact expected results is included in the following sections of this form k business employees  business environmental matters  business significant international operations  business seasonality and production schedules  business competition  legal proceedings  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
seasonality and production schedules the seasonality of farm equipment retail sales is directly affected by the timing of major crop activities tilling  planting and harvesting 
the timing of these activities is impacted by crop production and climate conditions 
the fourth quarter is generally the strongest demand period for retail farm equipment sales  normally representing approximately of sales by case s north american dealers 
the weakest retail demand for case farm equipment in north america typically occurs in the third quarter  accounting for approximately to of sales by case s north american dealers 
seasonal demand fluctuations for construction equipment are less significant than those for farm equipment 
nevertheless  in north america  housing construction slows down  especially in the midwest and on the east coast  beginning in november and continuing through the first quarter 
north american retail demand for case s construction equipment is strongest in the second and fourth quarters  which combined represent approximately to of sales by case s north american dealers 
european demand patterns are similar to those in the united states 
sales to independent dealers closely correspond with case s production levels  which are based upon its estimates of the demand for its products  taking into account the timing of dealer shipments which are in advance of retail demand  dealer inventory levels  the need to shut down production to enable manufacturing facilities to be prepared for the manufacture of new or different models and the efficient use of manpower and facilities 
the production levels are adjusted to reflect changes in estimated demand  dealer inventory levels  labor disruptions and other matters not within case s control 
inflation inflation impacts the company s business in both the costs of production and the demand for its products 
a significant portion of the cost of case machinery is comprised of material costs 
therefore  material price inflation could result in increased manufacturing costs through supplier price increases to case 
case s ability to recover increased supplier costs would be dependent  in part  on its competitors responses to these economic conditions 
manufacturing cost increases in excess of increased pricing in the market could have an adverse effect on case 
increases in inflation tend to cause higher interest rates 
the demand for farm and  to a greater extent  construction equipment is negatively impacted by high interest rates 
as interest rates on farm debt escalate  farmers tend to delay equipment purchases 
case s construction equipment business is heavily tied to the housing construction sector  and in the face of rising mortgage rates  potential homeowners tend to delay purchases 
increases in the level of worldwide inflation could have a negative effect on the level of demand for farm and construction equipment 
environmental matters the company s operations are subject to stringent environmental regulation by governmental authorities 
although the company has a program designed to implement environmental management practices and compliance and has reserved for environmental liabilities  it is possible that developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies or claims for damages to property  employees  other persons and the environment resulting from the company s operations  could result in future costs and liabilities that may exceed the range currently anticipated by the company 
as it has done in the past  the company intends to fund its cost of environmental compliance from operating cash flows

foreign currency risk management the company has significant manufacturing operations in the united states  france  germany and the united kingdom 
for the most part  case s products and components are only produced at a single manufacturing facility 
as a result  significant volumes of finished goods and components are exported to other countries 
in addition  the company buys finished products from germany  italy and japan for sale through its distribution network 
for goods purchased from other case affiliates  the company denominates the transaction in the functional currency of the producing nation 
large volume purchase agreements for products purchased from third parties normally contain currency risk sharing clauses that limit the amount of exposure from currency fluctuations 
foreign exchange transaction gains losses were million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company has adopted the following guidelines to manage its foreign exchange exposures i increase the predictability of costs associated with goods whose purchase price is not denominated in the functional currency of the buyer  ii minimize the cost of hedging through use of naturally offsetting positions  and iii where possible  sell product in the functional currency of the producing operation 
the company s identifiable exposures for fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies result primarily from accounts receivable  accounts payable  or cash outflows that are denominated in foreign currencies due to scheduled cash remittances 
the company identifies naturally occurring offsetting positions and then purchases forward contracts for the residual exposures

interest rate risk management the company has implemented an interest rate risk management program with respect to a portion of the credit facilities  which carry a floating rate of interest 
the program is within guidelines of the policies approved by the board of directors to limit exposure to rising interest rates 
the exact nature  timing and size of the program is based upon the amount of debt in case industrial and the credit companies
