claims expense for the indemnity business was of indemnity revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to in from in this decrease was largely attributable to the change in product mix with a higher percentage of revenues generated by managed benefits products 
since the indemnity business generates a higher per member per month revenue than generated by the managed benefits plans  and a portion of the sales and marketing costs  such as base salaries and printing costs  are fixed  the expenses as a percentage of revenues decline 
in addition  the commissions paid on the indemnity business are lower as a percentage of revenues than those paid on the managed benefits plans 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the decline in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to in from in was primarily attributable to efficiencies achieved through the consolidation of executive staffs and accounting departments due to the company s integration of its acquisitions 
in addition  there was a decrease in premium taxes as a percentage of revenue because the company now generates a greater percentage of its revenues in states that charge lower premium taxes 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or to million in from million in most of this increase was the result of amortization of goodwill and the agreements entered into in connection with the acquisitions of idh  us dental and ahp and the depreciation of the assets acquired 
interest 
interest expense decreased to million in from in the million was entirely attributable to the imputed interest on the agreements incurred to finance the idh  us dental and ahp acquisitions and the interest on the oracare promissory note 
the weighted average interest rates on the agreements and the oracare promissory note during were and  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate on the agreements includes the effects of the fees for the related letters of credit years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in of this increase  million  or was attributable to the operations added through the acquisition of us dental in november the remaining million increase was a increase in revenues to million in from million in  in markets where the company had operations in both periods 
this increase was primarily a result of having idh operations for the full year in compared to only four months in and the increase in the membership numbers 
during  members increased from  at december  to  at december  the increase in the comparable period in was from  to  interest income increased million  or from million to million in this increase was due to the interest income derived from the cash proceeds of the initial public offering in september dental services 
dental services expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in total dental services as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in  primarily due to the effect of a higher dental expense loss ratio in the indemnity insurance business that the company acquired through idh 
claims expense for the indemnity business was of indemnity revenues in as compared to in dental service expenses for the company s managed benefits plans plans  which consist primarily of capitation payments to general dentists  increased to of managed benefits revenues in  from in this increase is attributable to the fact that the plans offered by idh have historically paid general dentists a higher percentage of premiums than the company s pre existing plans 
it is management s intention to increase premiums over the next several years  as market conditions permit  thereby increasing revenues 
in most markets  amounts paid to general dentists will also be increased to maintain the company s competitive position and to improve the economics for general dentists 
the acquisition of associated will result in an increase of approximately in the percentage of dental services expenses for all of its managed dental benefits plans relative to managed benefits revenues in over the percentage experienced in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased million or  to million in from million in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to in from in this decrease was largely attributable to the change in product mix from primarily plans in to a combination of indemnity and plans in  resulting from the acquisition of idh effective september  since the indemnity business generates a higher per member per month revenue than is generated by the plans  and a portion of the sales and marketing costs  such as base salaries and printing costs  are fixed  the expenses as a percentage of revenues decline 
in addition  the commissions paid on the indemnity business are lower as a percentage of revenues than those paid on the plans 
general and administrative

in addition  there was a decrease in premium taxes as a percentage of revenue because the company now generates a greater percentage of its revenues in states that have lower premium taxes 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in most of this increase was the result of amortization of goodwill and consulting and non competition agreements the agreements attributable to the acquisitions of idh and us dental and the depreciation of the assets acquired 
interest 
interest expense increased to million in from in the million was composed of the interest on the bank loan  the promissory note and the imputed interest on the consulting and non competition agreements incurred to finance the idh and us dental acquisitions the agreements 
the weighted average interest rates on the bank loan  the promissory note and the agreements during were  and  respectively 
these weighted average interest rates include the effects of amortization of debt issuance costs and the fees for letters of credit related to the agreements 
taxes 
the average tax rate was and in and  respectively 
in and  the average tax rate was higher than the statutory federal tax rate of  primarily as the result of the nondeductibility of the amortization of goodwill 
the average rate decrease from to was primarily due to tax exempt interest income in extraordinary charge 
upon completion of the company s initial public offering in september  the company used a portion of the offering s proceeds to repay its bank debt 
this required the write off of the unamortized debt financing expenses capitalized in connection with the bank financing incurred to finance the idh acquisition and the financing obtained but not used for the us dental acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources in september  the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of its common stock for per share the offering  resulting in net proceeds of million 
the company used approximately million of such proceeds for the repayment of all outstanding bank indebtedness  which had been incurred in to finance the acquisition of idh 
in october  the company completed a public offering of  shares of its common stock for per share the offering  resulting in net proceeds of million 
the company used a portion of the proceeds to complete the acquisitions of independent  association  oracare and kcdc in and of united in the company s historical operating cash requirements have been met through cash provided by operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reduced amount of cash provided by operating activities in as compared to was a result of i a change to earlier capitation payments to certain network dentists that resulted in a one time increase in cash outflow and ii a change to later collection of prepaid revenues from certain groups that resulted in a one time decrease in cash inflows 
both changes were instituted to provide better customer service and had no direct effect on operating earnings 
the increase in premiums receivable of million  the decrease in unearned premiums of million and the decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and claims reserves of million all reflect this one time impact on cash from operating activities 
management believes that active management of receivables balances will result in a significant improvement in cash receipts during the company s primary cash need is for debt service on the agreements 
the principal amount of the outstanding indebtedness of the company at december  was million  consisting of the oracare promissory note of million and the liability for the agreements of million 
the promissory note was paid off on january  the idh agreements require payments of million on january and million on september each year 
the us dental agreements require monthly payments totaling million per year 
the ahp agreements require monthly payments totaling million per year 
on november   the company signed a revolving credit agreement providing a million revolving credit facility with an unaffiliated bank 
the purpose of the revolving credit facility is to provide i for funding future acquisitions of managed dental benefits companies  ii for the issuance of letters of credit  iii for capital expenditures and iv at the election of the company  a working capital line of credit in an amount up to million out of the total amount available under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility has a term of four years  expiring november  outstanding indebtedness under the revolving line of credit will bear interest payable quarterly  at the company s option  at i up to over the base rate of the lender or ii up to over libor  with the margin over the respective rates decreasing as the ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda decreases 
the company pays an annual fee of up to of the amount remaining available to be drawn under the credit facility and up to of the amount available to be drawn under the letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility is secured by the pledge of all the outstanding capital stock of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the company and a negative pledge on all other assets 
the revolving credit facility contains numerous covenants including  among other things  that the company cannot  except in certain permitted instances  i incur any additional indebtedness  ii grant liens on any of the assets of the company or its subsidiaries  iii declare or pay any dividends  or iv merge or consolidate with any other entity 
in addition  the company is required to satisfy on an ongoing basis certain financial covenants 
the company s breach of any covenant would result in an event of default under the revolving credit facility 
in  the company arranged for the issuance of two letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million 
the letters of credit secure the obligations of the company under certain agreements executed in connection with the idh acquisition 
the letters of credit decline in amount annually and expire in september the company pays an annual fee of up to of the amount remaining to be drawn under the letters of credit 
under applicable insurance laws of most states in which the company conducts business  the company s subsidiary operating in the particular state is required to maintain a minimum level of net worth and reserves 
in general  minimum capital requirements are more stringent for insurance companies  such as udcic 
the company may be required from time to time to invest funds in one or more of its subsidiaries to meet regulatory capital requirements 
the implementation of risk based capital regulations in states having jurisdiction over udcic may require that the company increase its investment in udcic 
however  the company does not believe that compliance with such regulations will adversely affect the company s ability to meet its operating cash requirements 
the company believes that udcic will be able to satisfy such regulations without the need for significant capital contributions by the company 
applicable laws generally limit the ability of the company s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the extent that required regulatory capital would be impaired 
capital expenditures were million during the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  such expenditures in primarily consisted of the capitalized costs related to the new information system  expected to be completed in in june  the company entered into a contract to acquire a new information system to replace its existing system 
the capital cost of the conversion of all current systems is expected to be approximately million 
this capital cost includes the capitalization of certain direct internal costs associated with the new system in addition to external costs such as consulting fees and hardware and software expenditures 
management believes that cash flow generated by operations will be sufficient to fund the company s normal working capital needs and capital expenditures other than any acquisitions for at least the next twelve months because the company s operations are not capital intensive 
management believes that the company s operations are not materially affected by inflation 
the company s principal costs  such as dental services expense and sales and marketing expenses are largely related to membership levels and are  therefore  variably related to premium revenues 
historically  the company s rate of premium increases has been less than the rate of increase in dental costs in general
