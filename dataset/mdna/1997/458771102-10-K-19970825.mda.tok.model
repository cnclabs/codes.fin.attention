the statements contained in this annual report which are not historical fact are forward looking statements that involve various important assumptions  risks  uncertainties and other factors which could cause the company s actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements

results of operations fiscal and fiscal consolidated consolidated revenue decreased in fiscal compared to an increase of in fiscal in fiscal  increases in sales of both magnet systems and refrigeration products were offset by a substantial reduction in sales of superconducting materials 
additionally  revenues in fiscal included much higher royalty and interest income  and a  gain on the sale of an investment 
these factors  together with a substantial increase in sales of refrigeration products  accounted for the revenue increase in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross margins  which had declined in fiscal  recovered in fiscal the increase was due to continuing cost reduction efforts and a more favorable product mix  partially offset by yield losses in the wire operation and substantial competitive pressure on selling prices for magnets and superconducting materials 
in fiscal  these last two factors  together with rework costs associated with certain new refrigeration products and slower than planned magnet production costs reductions  accounted for the lower gross margin 
looking forward  the company expects greater sales and earnings in fiscal this expectation is based on the following assumptions  among others the market for mri systems continues to grow  the company can successfully contend with continued competitive pressure on selling prices in the mri marketplace  anticipated sales of refrigerants occur  and  reductions in production costs in both business segments continue 
in addition  fiscal will include the operations of medical advances  inc mai for the full year 
mai was acquired in march  as described in liquidity and capital commitments company funded product research and development expenses increased in fiscal with increased spending in all business segments 
these expenses had increased slightly in fiscal these spending trends are due to the fact that the company s average employment level increased in fiscal to the point where it no longer qualified as a small business and thus was no longer eligible for certain government funded research awards 
in the absence of these funding sources  the percentage of internally funded research and development expenses has increased 
marketing  general and administrative expenses grew in fiscal compared with growth of in fiscal this was due primarily to the creation of two separate organizations intercool energy corporation in fiscal  and  imig mri  llc imig  a joint venture with surrey medical imaging systems limited smis  in fiscal ice s purpose is to develop and market frigc r refrigerants 
imig was formed to commercialize a new  low cost permanent magnet based magnetic resonance imaging system 
additionally  fiscal reflects the inclusion of mai s expenses from the date of its acquisition in march  interest expense was lower in both fiscal and fiscal due to the conversion of  of the company s convertible  subordinated debentures in september  and the repayment of  of installment notes in december  during the first quarter of fiscal  the company made an additional investment in smis  bringing its ownership to approximately 
smis is a uk company engaged in the manufacture and sale of electronics and software for magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy applications 
due to its increased ownership  the company adopted the equity method of accounting for its investment 
as a result  the company recorded a loss on its investment of  in fiscal and  in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate decreased slightly in both years 
fiscal benefited from the utilization of certain tax credits 
the reduction in fiscal taxes was due to lower state income taxes and the effects of establishing a foreign sales corporation

in fiscal  the parties modified the agreement to change pennzoil s status from an exclusive to a non exclusive distributor 
since that time  the company has been actively seeking additional distributors 
in march   the company announced that it had reached an agreement with al murjan environmental management and technology co  ltd 
of jeddah  saudi arabia to be its sales representative for fr refrigerant in the middle east 
segment discussion magnetic products segment 
this segment consists of the design  development  manufacture and sale of superconductive magnets and materials  permanent magnets  rf coils  and other magnetic products 
the dollar value of sales for the segment as a whole  decreased in fiscal and in fiscal magnet system sales including mai increased by in fiscal compared with a decline of in fiscal material sales were lower by in fiscal with a nominal increase in fiscal the sales decline in this segment in fiscal was principally due to substantially lower superconducting material sales to a major customer who decided not to renew a long term supply agreement 
while this customer continues to purchase some of its requirements from the company  future sales growth will depend on securing new orders and additional customers 
the sales reduction in fiscal reflected the effect of reduced selling prices for mri products and a leveling off in the growth of the mri market 
gross profit margins in fiscal  as a percentage of net sales  increased for magnet products due to a more favorable product mix including mai and improved production costs  but declined substantially for materials due to lower sales volume and continued yield losses in wire manufacturing 
gross profit margins declined in fiscal due to lower selling prices  slower than planned magnet cost reductions and yield losses in wire manufacturing 
refrigeration products segment 
this segment  which consists of the design  development  manufacture and sale of cryogenic refrigeration equipment and refrigerants  had increased sales of approximately in fiscal and in fiscal these increases were primarily the result of sales of fr tm refrigerant in both years and a substantial increase in sales of laboratory and cryotiger systems in fiscal and shield coolers in fiscal gross profit margin  as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal and decreased slightly in fiscal the fiscal increase was due to cost reductions for refrigerants and cryogenic refrigeration equipment 
the fiscal decline reflected price reductions for shield coolers and rework costs associated with certain new cryogenic refrigeration products

these rf coils are used to obtain organ specific mri signals for improved image quality and are used on many parts of the body 
the company paid  in cash net of cash acquired and issued  shares of common stock including  shares of treasury stock for all of the outstanding shares of mai stock 
the acquisition agreement provides for the issuance of up to  additional shares of common stock as part of the purchase price if the average of the company s closing price on the american stock exchange  during the ninety calendar day period following the release of earnings for fiscal  falls below

the company s capital resource commitments as of july  consisted principally of capital equipment commitments of  the company has a three year  unsecured  line of credit with a bank which bears interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus or prime and will expire in november   none of which was in use on july  the company is negotiating a new line of credit 
the company believes that it will have sufficient working capital to meet its needs for the short term by using internally generated funds and existing credit facilities 
however  on a longer term basis with substantial increases in sales volume and or unusually large expenditure requirements to commercialize the frigcae family of refrigerants  the company may be required to obtain additional lines of credit for working capital purposes and possibly make periodic public offerings or private placements in order to meet the liquidity needs of such growth 
while the company does not believe it will be restricted in financing such growth  there can be no assurances that such sources of financing will be available to the company in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
under such circumstances  the company would expect to manage its growth within the financing available
