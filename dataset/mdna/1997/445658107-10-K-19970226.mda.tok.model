the following operating expense categories increased or decreased at percentage rates significantly different than the rate of revenue increase during the period indicated compared to revenue increased 
the increase in purchased transportation was primarily due to the growth of logistics and dedicated contract business  which results in additional payments to railroads and third party companies for transportation service 
fuel and fuel taxes increased  primarily due to significant increases in fuel cost per gallon 
this cost increase was partly offset by fuel surcharge revenue billed to customers 
the million  or  reduction in depreciation expense was due  in part  to gains on the sale of the special commodities and parcel management businesses 
gains of million before income taxes were recognized on the sale of these businesses and other assets and were offset against depreciation expense 
gains on the sale of revenue equipment were million in lower depreciation expense on certain revenue equipment and on board tractor communication devices also reduced depreciation expense 
significantly higher accident rates during the first half of contributed to the increase in insurance and claims costs 
a decision was announced in july to limit the speed of over the road tractors to miles per hour 
accident rates declined during late  partly due to lower speeds and additional management focus 
the significant decline in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower advertising costs 
special charges of million were recorded in to reduce the carrying value of idle and under performing assets 
no special charges were recorded in the increase in communication and utilities was primarily due to certain rate reductions and one time credits recognized in early compared to revenue increased 
salaries  wages and employee benefits increased 
this increase was due in part to a driver pay increase implemented in april for the company s least experienced drivers 
purchased transportation increased  primarily due to the growth of logistics and dedicated contract business and resulting payments to railroads and third party transportation companies 
the increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to significant increases in the size of and upgrading the trailing equipment fleet  the addition of on board tractor communication devices and lower equipment gains in gains on the disposition of revenue equipment  which are offset against depreciation expense  were million in and million in while the number of accidents did not increase significantly during  a small number of severe accidents which fell within the company s self insured limits contributed to the significant increase in insurance and claims 
the significant increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher levels of spending for driver advertising and recruiting and recognition of certain uncollectible accounts receivable amounts 
special charges of million were recorded during the fourth quarter of to reduce the carrying value of idle and under performing assets 
the increase in communications and utilities was primarily due to higher satellite usage charges in related to on board tractor communication devices

in september  the company announced a historic compensation package for its approximate  over the road van drivers 
this comprehensive plan  effective february   includes an average percent increase in wages for this group of drivers 
the expected results of this program include a more stable and experienced work force capable of delivering a high quality of customer service 
funding of this increased level of expense  estimated to approximate million per year  is expected to result from shifting costs out of driver recruiting and training  safety  and from improved equipment utilization 
both company owned driver training centers were closed in october  as an initial step to generate a portion of the planned cost savings
