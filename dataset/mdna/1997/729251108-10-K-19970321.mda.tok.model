item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations events and trends affecting operating results market forces 
the demand for logs and manufactured wood products depends upon international and domestic market conditions  the value of the us dollar in foreign exchange markets  competition  the availability of substitute products and other factors 
in particular  the demand for logs  lumber  plywood and mdf is affected by residential and industrial construction  and repair and remodel activity 
these activities are subject to fluctuations due to changes in economic conditions  tariffs  interest rates  population growth and other economic  demographic and environmental factors 
additionally  the demand for logs is impacted by the demand for wood chips in the pulp and paper markets 
current market conditions 
prices for domestic logs in the cascades region for decreased from levels experienced in  primarily as a result of weak pulp and chip markets 
pulp and paper markets have been weak for the past year resulting in an excess supply of wood chips 
the over supply has depressed chip prices and caused downward pressure on the price of domestic logs in the cascades region 
however  prices have improved slightly since the third quarter of as a result of the robust housing market  the strong export market and reduced log production due to winter weather 
prices for domestic logs in the rockies region for have remained relatively flat from those experienced during the downward pressure due to weak chip prices and declining commodity plywood prices has been offset by favorable lumber prices 
prices have declined since the third quarter of due to seasonal declines in building activity and declining commodity plywood prices 
pulp log prices declined significantly during in both regions as a result of weakness in the pulp and paper markets 
domestic and pulp log prices in the southern region increased during the fourth quarter of as a result of wet weather limiting supply 
in the export market  douglas fir prices were stable compared to japanese demand was strong due to a robust japanese housing market as a result of an improving economy  record low interest rates and an upcoming increase in the japanese consumption tax 
at year end  prices for douglas fir began to soften as a result of importers adjusting to an anticipated decline in demand following an april  consumption tax increase 
export prices for whitewoods have declined as compared to due to ample supply and increased acceptance of substitute products 
however  whitewood prices improved during the fourth quarter of due to a temporary supply shortage which resulted from strong domestic demand and prior production curtailments 
industry composite indices for lumber commodity prices were higher in than in the increase in lumber prices was a result of the robust housing market  the reduced supply of canadian lumber and strength in the repair and remodel markets in the retail sector 
the housing sector has been strong throughout due to favorable interest rates and a good economy 
as a result  the backlog of unsold homes has been declining and housing starts have remained strong 
effective april  the united states and canada agreed to place a quota on the amount of duty free lumber that can be exported to the united states 
additionally  the cost of manufacturing lumber in the canadian provence of british columbia has increased due to higher stumpage prices and environmental costs 
both the quota and higher costs have contributed to the upward pressure on the price of lumber 
lumber prices in the repair and remodel markets continued to improve as a result of supply limitations caused by a decline in the supply of preferred western species and numerous mills targeting production toward the housing market sector 
industry composite indices for plywood commodity prices were lower than in primarily due to increased competition from osb 
north american osb capacity increased by over in  and capacity is expected to increase by approximately in through in the fourth quarter of  osb prices declined to a record five year low due to seasonal declines in building activity and increased capacity 
this has resulted in an unusually high plywood to osb price premium 
prices for the company s mdf were lower in  compared to  due to significant capacity expansion during between and  north american mdf capacity increased from approximately billion square feet to approximately billion square feet and is expected to expand even faster in at the same time demand has been reduced as distributors reduce inventory levels in anticipation of further price declines 
comparability of financial statement periods 
as part of its business strategy  the company has pursued and will continue to pursue the acquisition of additional timberlands to increase inventories of fee timber 
on november   the company completed the montana timberland acquisition 
in addition  on october   the company completed the southern region acquisition 
see note to notes to combined financial statements 
the company may also  from time to time  sell timberlands and facilities if attractive opportunities arise 
the newport asset sale was completed on october  revenues and operating income generated by the assets sold in the newport asset sale were million and million  respectively  in and were million and million  respectively in accordingly  the comparability of periods covered by the company s financial statements is  and in the future may be  affected by the impact of acquisitions and divestitures 
harvest plans 
the partnership determines its harvesting plans based on a number of factors  including age and size of  and species distribution within  its timber acreage  economic maturity of each harvest area  environmental considerations and mill requirements both in the conversion facilities and at unaffiliated mills 
the timing of harvests of merchantable timber depends in part on growth cycles and in part on economic conditions 
harvest levels in the rocky mountain region have averaged approximately mmbf excluding the harvest from the timberlands sold in the newport asset sale over the last three years 
these harvest levels are expected  on average  to remain relatively stable over the next several years 
by the year  the partnership anticipates that it will have nearly completed the conversion of slower growing forests to younger  more productive stands in the rocky mountain region  at which time it anticipates a moderate reduction in the region s harvest levels 
harvest levels in the cascades region have averaged mmbf over the past three years 
the partnership expects its harvest levels to decline gradually for the foreseeable future as the conversion process in the region approaches completion 
harvest levels in the southern region are expected to increase modestly between and as we complete the conversion of mature second growth pine timberlands into intensively managed pine plantations 
following the completion of the conversion process  harvest levels should decline and then gradually increase as the company benefits from the faster growing  intensively managed plantations 
since harvest plans are influenced by projections of demand  price  availability of timber from other sources and other factors that may be outside of the partnership s control  actual harvest levels may vary 
the partnership believes that its harvest plans are sufficiently flexible to permit modification in response to short term fluctuations in the markets for logs and lumber 
results of operations the following table compares operating income by segment for the years ended december   and operating income by segment in thousands resources    manufacturing    other eliminations    total    compared to resources segment revenues increased by million  or  to million in  as compared to million in such increase was primarily due to a million increase in land sales revenue and an million increase as a result of the addition of the southern timberlands in the southern region acquisition  offset in part by a decrease of million in revenues from northwest timberland pulpwood and chip sales 
the increase in land sales revenue was due to approximately  acres of higher and better use land sales in resulting in revenues of million  compared to million in see item business resources segment land management 
the decrease in pulpwood and chip revenues was a result of weak pulp and paper markets and the over supply of available wood fiber 
domestic log sales volume in the northwest timberlands increased by  compared to  as a result of increased harvest levels to take advantage of favorable pricing resulting from strong product markets 
export prices decreased by  compared to  due to a higher percentage of lower valued logs in the sales mix 
resources segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in such increase was primarily due to million of additional costs related to the southern region  the increase in land sales  the increase in northwest timberlands domestic log sales volume and increased costs related to longer hauling distances  offset in part by reduced pulpwood and chip operations 
manufacturing segment revenues increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in such increase was due to additional revenues of million from the southern conversion facilities  increased lumber sales prices and increased mdf sales volumes  offset in part by lower mdf sales prices and decreased chip revenues 
lumber sales prices in the northwest increased by as compared to the year earlier period as a result of the robust housing market  strength in the repair and remodel markets and supply constraints 
the us housing market remained unusually strong throughout most of the summer and fall 
additionally  as a result of the us canada trade agreement  canada was not able to significantly increase its output to take full advantage of the improving us housing market 
the partnership also experienced favorable pricing in the repair and remodel markets due to reduced supply as a result of a number of mills targeting production toward the home construction segment 
mdf sales volume was restored to normal levels during the second half of and was higher than the sales volume for mdf sales volume was unusually low during due to production downtime associated with the conversion of production processes to manufacture high quality  super refined mdf and weak market conditions 
mdf prices decreased by as a result of significant capacity expansion 
however  the company experienced less downward price pressure than the industry as a whole due to increasing demand for its higher quality mdf product 
residual chip prices decreased by over due to excess chip inventories throughout the entire industry 
the chip plant was closed during most of as a result of weak chip markets 
manufacturing segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in such increase was primarily due to million of additional costs related to the southern conversion facilities and increased mdf sales volumes 
other costs and eliminations which consists of corporate overhead  intercompany log profit elimination  and intercompany lifo elimination decreased operating income by million in compared to million in the variance of million was primarily due to the release of more intercompany log profit in than in as a result of reducing inventory levels in on a combined basis  the resources segment s profit on intercompany log sales is deferred until manufacturing converts existing log inventories into finished products and sells them to third parties 
interest expense increased by million as a result of both an increase in outstanding debt and debt issuance costs related to the october southern region acquisition 
gain on disposition of assets increased in primarily as a result of a million gain related to the newport asset sale 
the income allocated to the general partner increased by million during compared to as a result of higher quarterly distributions to the unitholders which increased the incentive distribution paid to the general partner and an increase in net income 
net income is allocated to the general partner based on two percent of the company s net income adjusted for the incentive distribution paid  plus the incentive distribution 
the incentive distribution is based on a percentage of the quarterly distribution paid which totaled per unit for the year ended  compared to per unit in compared to resources segment revenues increased by million  or  to million in  as compared to million in such increase was primarily due to a million increase in revenues from pulpwood and chip sales offset in part by lower export log sales volume and lower domestic log prices 
the increase in pulpwood and chip revenues was due to the addition in of in woods chipping operations  which utilize small tops of trees and small trees from thinning operations  and a significant increase in pulp log prices and sales volume as compared to due to strong pulp and paper markets 
export log sales volume decreased by as compared to due to the shifting of lower quality export logs to the domestic market as a result of a weaker japanese economy and a planned reduction in harvest levels 
domestic log prices decreased by as compared to the decrease was attributable entirely to the rocky mountain region and was due to weak lumber markets and aggressive competition from canadian lumber producers 
resources segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in as compared to million in such increase was primarily due to the costs relating to higher volumes of pulpwood and chip sales 
manufacturing segment revenues increased by million  or  to million in as compared to million in such increase was due to an increase in lumber sales volume and a increase in revenues from residual chip sales  offset in part by lower lumber prices and lower mdf sales volume 
lumber sales volume increased by as compared to due to increased production as a result of the partnership s new lumber remanufacturing facility  higher productivity due to improved log merchandising specifications and capital improvements  and additional production shifts 
lumber prices decreased by as compared to due to a weaker housing market as a result of generally slower economic conditions  and increased competition from both canadian imports and substitute products 
while the partnership s lumber prices are influenced by commodity prices  it is able to maintain sales volume due to its high concentration of sales in the repair and remodel and industrial markets  which are less affected by the slow housing market 
mdf sales volume decreased by as compared to as a result of production downtime associated with weak market conditions and operational issues encountered during the start up of new high energy refiners for the partnership s new mdf product 
residual chip revenues increased due to a substantial increase in prices over due to strong pulp and paper markets 
manufacturing segment costs and expenses were million for each of the years ended and increased costs due to increased lumber sales volumes were offset by lower log costs and lower for lumber and plywood  respectively and lower mdf production costs as a result of downtime 
other costs and eliminations reduced operating income by million in as compared to reducing income by million in the variance was primarily due to lower intercompany profit elimination  offset in part by an increase in the intercompany lifo elimination 
on a combined basis  the resources segment s profit on intercompany log sales is deferred until manufacturing converts existing log inventories into finished products and sells them to third parties 
the intercompany profit elimination was lower than the prior year s due to a decrease in log inventory levels  and a lower log transfer price as a result of a weaker domestic log market 
on a combined basis  the lifo impact related to price fluctuations on the sale of intercompany logs is eliminated 
the intercompany lifo elimination was greater than the prior year s due to a lower log transfer price  which resulted in a greater decrement in manufacturing s separate company lifo reserve as compared to the combined lifo reserve 
the income allocated to the general partner increased by million during compared to as a result of higher quarterly distributions to the unitholders which increased the incentive distribution paid to the general partner 
net income is allocated to the general partner based on of the company s net income adjusted for the incentive distribution paid  plus the incentive distribution 
the incentive distribution is based on a percentage of the quarterly distribution paid which totaled per unit for the year ended  as compared to per unit in export sales the company sells logs and finished wood products for export 
these sales are denominated in us dollars and are generally sold to pacific rim countries  principally japan  canada and europe 
combined export revenues as a percentage of total revenues were  and for   and  respectively 
financial condition and liquidity net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase of million in is primarily a result of increased operating income compared to in  operating cash flow was reduced by million  net of expense  for the funding of certain employee benefit plans

capital expenditures have decreased as compared to and due to the completion of major improvements at the majority of the manufacturing facilities 
planned capital expenditures for the resources segment in are million  primarily for logging roads and reforestation 
the manufacturing segment s planned capital expenditures are million which includes various lumber and plywood projects to improve productivity and increase recovery  as well as replacements and upgrades of equipment in several of the conversion facilities 
effect of inflation during recent years the company has generally experienced increased costs due to the effect of inflation  particularly in the manufacturing segment  on the cost of raw materials  labor  supplies and energy and  in the resources segment  on logging and hauling costs 
however  the company utilizes the lifo inventory valuation method for its raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventory which generally matches current costs to current revenues and thus  tends to reflect the impact of inflation on cost of goods sold
