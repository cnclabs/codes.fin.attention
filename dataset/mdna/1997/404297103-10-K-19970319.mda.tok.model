item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general over the past months  the company has undertaken several strategic initiatives that have positioned the company for a period of significant growth in reserves  production  cash flow and earnings 
in  the company articulated a strategy that included i consolidating in its core geographic areas  particularly the d j basin  ii diversifying its asset base outside of the d j basin  iii capturing more of the value stream by marketing its production and iv maximizing its financial flexibility 
by completing the acquisitions and the merger and by forming two important  exploration focused gulf coast joint ventures  southtech and chenier  hsr has taken the fundamental initial steps to implement its strategy 
management s focus for the foreseeable future will be to continue to execute this strategy with particular emphasis on activities that maximize the financial returns from hsr s expanded asset base 
the company now has three significant core areas of operations  the geologic and geographic diversity of which combine to create an oil and natural gas company with attractive  long lived reserves balanced with meaningful exposure to exploration and technologically driven upside 
the company has also created a strategically important and profitable presence in the natural gas marketing  trading and transportation business  which provides the opportunity for the company to increase its operating margins on production from both the d j basin and mid continent areas and has begun an oil trading and transportation business to be engaged in the purchase  sale and transport of crude oil 
the united states oil and gas industry is subject to large variations in profitability due in part  to fluctuating commodity prices and related changes in rates of reinvestment by industry participants 
over the past year the industry has seen increases in both oil and natural gas prices from the relatively low price levels experienced in several factors have lead to a positive fundamental outlook for the oil and gas industry and improved economics for production in the company s core geographic areas 
these include i low natural gas storage levels combined with relatively high wellhead capacity utilization  ii increasing overall natural gas demand  iii deregulation of distribution and marketing channels  particularly for d j basin and rocky mountain production  and expansion of pipeline capacity to transfer gas to markets outside the colorado front range and iv successful application of advanced oil and natural gas exploration  drilling and production technologies 
since the end of  oil and natural gas prices have decreased in certain areas of the country  in part due to weather conditions 
natural gas price considerations approximately of the company s proved producing reserves consist of natural gas located in the d j basin and mid continent areas 
the absolute level and volatility of natural gas prices have a material impact on the company 
during and early  prices for rocky mountain natural gas were substantially below prices for natural gas in markets outside the rocky mountain region 
this disparity was caused by low demand for rocky mountain gas due to an unusually warm winter season and above normal availability of hydro electric power in the western united states 
this resulted in excess natural gas supply in the rocky mountains which led to downward price pressure in the colorado front range market 
however  through the end of  the market for the company s d j basin natural gas had strengthened substantially due to several factors 
first  the excess supply from wyoming natural gas producers has declined as a result of increased demand from west coast markets 
second  in october  the colorado public utilities commission approved tariff changes that effectively eliminated transportation costs for d j basin natural gas sold to the colorado front range market  resulting in an approximately per mmbtu transportation cost advantage for d j basin producers 
third  the supply of d j basin natural gas has declined over the last two years due to reduced drilling in the d j basin and natural production declines 
the average natural gas price received by the company for its d j basin production has increased from per mcf in to per mcf in in addition  expansion of pipeline capacity has begun  which will  in mid to late  provide additional transportation outlets for wyoming producers to markets other than the colorado front range 
the company believes that these developments will further reduce the disparity between d j basin pricing and pricing generally available elsewhere in the united states 
the d j basin provides a significant portion of the company s natural gas production 
historically  the price of d j basin natural gas on a btu equivalent basis has been linked closely to the colorado interstate gas pipeline cig rocky mountain index 
however  more recently  as a result of the tariff changes and the seasonal nature of demand in the colorado front range  the price for d j basin natural gas tends to reflect the cig rocky mountain index during the low demand summer months generally april through october and mid continent indices during the high demand winter periods generally november through march 
gas prices in the mid continent are closely tied to established indices which are influenced by national supply and demand factors 
average natural gas prices received by the company in the mid continent generally fluctuate with changes in mid continent posted prices  which for the years through averaged per mmbtu less than the henry hub price 
the average natural gas price received in the mid continent since the merger in june through december   was per mcf  or below the henry hub price before hedging 
oil price considerations oil prices are established in a highly liquid international market 
average oil prices received by the company in the d j basin and mid continent generally fluctuate with changes in the nymex west texas intermediate nymex wti crude oil closing prices 
the company s average oil price for was approximately per bbl below nymex wti closing prices 
the average oil price for was approximately below nymex wti closing prices 
the increase in the relative value of the company s oil production during is a result of renegotiation of several oil sales contracts  as well as the general increase in the market value of the company s d j basin oil production 
results of operations during the company continued drilling and development activity in the d j basin and completed the merger and the acquisitions 
at december   the company owned interests in more than  producing wells of which it operated more than  compared to  wells of which it operated more than  at december  the company s results of operations have been significantly affected by the acquisitions  the merger and its drilling program 
fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices have also significantly affected the company s results 
comparison of years ended december  and oil and gas revenues for the comparative periods  oil production increased from  mbbls to  mbbls and gas production increased from  mmcf to  mmcf  or and  respectively 
average oil prices realized increased by from to per bbl and average gas prices realized increased by from to per mcf 
the production increases were the result of additional production from the properties acquired in the acquisitions and the merger and new wells drilled by the company 
the net effect of these changes resulted in an increase in oil and gas revenues from million to million or 
the company also recognized million in other gas revenues from the sale of tax credits with respect to its section tax credit agreements for the year ended december   as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company  through its gas marketing division and its wholly owned subsidiary  twtt  actively markets a portion of its own natural gas production  markets natural gas to third parties and supplies natural gas to end users 
trading and transportation net margins were  at december  there were no comparable revenues in interest income and other income interest and other income increased by  or  for the year ended december  the increase in interest and other income was mainly due to short term investing of the company s available funds  as well as a gain recorded on the sale of assets of production expenses lease operating expenses increased by  or  due to an increase in the number of producing wells 
on a boe basis  lease operating expenses increased from to for the comparative periods 
this increase is primarily the result of a different mix of wells in the current year  including wells with historically higher operating costs which were acquired as a result of the acquisitions 
production taxes increased by  or  due to increased production and prices 
production taxes in reflect an adjustment for a reduction in the company s severance tax rate 
a cumulative rate adjustment for was recorded in the third quarter of depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a  a non cash expense  increased  or  due to an increase in production and an increase in the depletion rate 
for the year ended december   the company had a weighted depletion rate of per boe for the quarter end december  
the company adjusts its dd a rate based on material changes in its reserves and on an annual basis based on year end engineering 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense reflects costs incurred net of administrative costs directly attributable to drilling and well operations  which costs are included in lease operating expenses or are capitalized 
general and administrative expenses increased  or 
the increase for the comparative periods is primarily attributable to the merger and retention of the former tide west employees 
on a boe basis  general and administrative expenses decreased from to for the comparative periods 
interest expense interest expense increased  or  due to increased borrowings on the company s long term bank debt 
also  in november  the company issued million of its senior subordinated notes due in provision for income taxes the company follows the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
pursuant to sfas  the company has recorded a tax provision based on tax rates in effect during the period 
accordingly  the company accrued taxes at the rate of in and due to significant intangible drilling costs  which are deductible for tax purposes  substantially all of the company s tax provision in both periods is deferred 
comparison of years ended december  and oil and gas revenues for the comparative periods  oil production decreased from  mbbls to  mbbls and gas production increased from  mmcf to  mmcf  or and  respectively 
the average price of oil increased by from to per bbl  and gas prices decreased by  from to per mcf 
the net effect of these changes resulted in an oil and gas revenue decrease of from million to million 
the company also recognized million in other gas revenues from the sale of tax credits for the year ended december   as discussed in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased by  or  for the year ended december  this was due primarily to short term investing of additional funds in the prior year  which were available as a result of the november offerings 
by the end of the second quarter of  the company s drilling programs absorbed any remaining available funds from those offerings 
production expenses lease operating expenses increased by million or  due to the increase in the number of producing wells 
production taxes  which are a direct result of oil and gas sales  decreased by million or  for the period ended december   as a result of the decrease in oil and gas sales  as well as a reduction in the company s effective severance tax rate 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million or  for the year ended december   due to an overall increase in production and an increase in the depletion rate from per boe to per boe 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses reflect costs incurred  net of administrative costs directly attributable to drilling and well operations 
such costs are included in lease operating expenses or are capitalized 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  for the period ended december  the decrease is due to the increased well related reimbursements resulting from an increase in the number of wells operated 
interest expense interest expense for the period ended december   increased million or 
the increase is due to increased borrowings on the company s long term bank debt 
provision for income taxes pursuant to sfas  the company has recorded a tax provision based on tax rates in effect during the period 
accordingly  the company accrued taxes at the rate of in and due to significant intangible drilling costs  which are deductible for tax purposes  all of the company s tax provision in both periods is deferred 
liquidity and capital resources financing sources the company is committed to reducing its debt to total book capitalization ratio and is currently evaluating various alternatives by which to do so  including asset divestitures 
the company believes that it will be able to arrange a favorable combination of financing alternatives to fund its ongoing capital requirements and reduce its overall financial leverage 
until this debt ratio is reduced  the company currently plans to fund capital expenditures attributable to exploration and drilling activities primarily out of its expected cash flow from operations 
the company has financed  and expects to continue to finance  its acquisition activities  if any  with i cash flow from operations  ii borrowings under the chase facility defined below  iii public offerings of equity and debt  iv divestitures including asset monetizations of non core assets and v the tcw facility as defined 
borrowings in connection with acquisitions may have the affect of increasing the company s leverage 
on june   the company entered into a million revolving and senior bank credit facility with the chase manhattan bank  as agent the chase facility 
on june   the company amended the terms of the chase facility to increase the maximum credit amount to million 
under the terms of the chase facility  no principal payments are required until june   assuming the company maintains a borrowing base sufficient to support the outstanding loan balance 
the borrowing base is based on the underlying value of the company s oil and natural gas properties 
the chase facility bears interest at the base rate plus to or libor plus to 
as part of the amendment to the chase facility  tide west s senior bank debt in the amount of million was fully repaid 
in november  the company issued million of its senior subordinated notes due in the notes 
the offering of the notes the offering was undertaken in order to replace a portion of the company s outstanding indebtedness under the chase facility with fixed rate term debt 
upon consummation of the offering and the application of the estimated net proceeds therefrom  the borrowing base under the chase facility was amended to million  resulting in an amount available for borrowing of million at december  the notes issued are general  unsecured obligations of the company  subordinated in right of payment to all existing and any future senior indebtedness of the company 
the notes rank pari passu with existing and any future senior subordinated indebtedness including the company s senior subordinated notes and senior to any future subordinated indebtedness of the company 
the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  on an unsecured  senior subordinated basis by two of the company s subsidiaries  orion acquisition  inc and hsrtw  inc 
the subsidiary guarantors 
there are no significant contractual restrictions on distributions from each of the subsidiary guarantors to the company 
in august  the company signed a term sheet with a trust company of the west related entity covering a proposed million non recourse  volumetric overriding royalty facility the tcw facility 
the proceeds from the tcw facility may be used by the company at its discretion for a variety of corporate purposes  including acquisitions of new properties  exploration and development drilling and monetization of existing corporate properties 
effective july  the company sold certain non strategic properties under the tcw facility for total consideration of million 
the company used the sale proceeds to repay indebtedness under the chase facility 
the company anticipates that its available borrowing capacity under the chase facility  combined with its operating cash flow and the tcw facility  provide the company with the financial resources and flexibility to fund current and ongoing development activities and to meet other financial obligations 
since the consummation of the merger and the acquisitions  the company has monetized million of non strategic properties including the tcw sale  using the proceeds to reduce outstanding borrowings under the chase facility 
the nature of the company s current development strategies and other activities provide the company with considerable flexibility in terms of the timing and magnitude of its capital expenditures 
if the company experiences unforeseen changes in its working capital position or capital resources  management may revise the capital expenditure program accordingly or alternatively may supplement the capital position of the company through  among other things  the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or by entering into joint venture arrangements 
capital commitments for the twelve months ended december   the company incurred total exploration  development and leasehold capital expenditures of million 
the company estimates capital expenditures for will be approximately million  which will be allocated in varying amounts primarily to activities in the company s three core geographic areas the d j basin of the rocky mountains  the anadarko and arkoma basins of the mid continent and the on shore gulf coast region 
the company continuously evaluates its inventory of drilling opportunities and adjusts the amount and allocation of its capital program based on a number of factors  including seismic results  prospect readiness  product prices  service company availability and rates  acquisitions and capital position 
a major component of the company s capital expenditure program includes costs associated with the consolidation and development drilling in the d j basin  and  to a lesser extent  the development of its other rocky mountain properties 
in the second quarter of  the company acquired basin s d j basin properties for a total cash consideration of million 
the acquisitions increased the company s d j basin reserves by mmboe and production by  boe per day 
the company also incurred approximately million in capital expenditures in for drilling and recompleting wells and building gathering systems on the company s existing wattenberg field area properties  compared to million in the second component of the company s capital expenditure program is the continued exploitation of the properties acquired as a result of the merger with tide west 
since the completion of the merger in june  the company has incurred total exploitation and development expenditures in the mid continent area of million 
the company is currently evaluating a variety of opportunities that include increased exploitation  exploration and density drilling  recompletions and field extensions 
the final component of the company s capital expenditure program is to develop exploitation and exploration prospects in the gulf coast 
as described below  the company has entered into two joint ventures 
in  the company incurred total capital expenditures of million in the gulf coast 
the company spent approximately million under the southtech joint venture in for seismic  leasehold and overhead costs 
in  the company spent approximately million in similar costs and for drilling 
in june  the company entered into an exploration and development agreement with chenier exploration  inc cei  pursuant to which the company purchased from cei and a third party interests in properties in the gulf coast for approximately million  of which million was paid in cash and the remaining portion was funded with a promissory note 
under the terms of the agreements  cei will be responsible for the generation and development of prospects in the project areas 
in  the company spent for seismic  leasehold  drilling and overhead costs 
in  the company entered into an exploration agreement with union pacific resources company covering drilling locations in the d j basin  pursuant to which the company committed to spend million during the two years ended june and meet certain other minimum obligations 
all such commitments have been met 
in  the company elected to extend the agreement and committed to spend approximately million by june the company has also entered into a number of other standard industry arrangements that require the drilling of wells or other activities 
the company believes that it will meet its obligations under these arrangements  which individually and in the aggregate are not material 
working capital and cash flow working capital at december  was million 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   was million  up from million in the same period in this increase is primarily the result of increased oil and natural gas production revenues attributable to the larger number of producing wells resulting from its drilling activities and the wells acquired in the acquisitions and the merger  as well as higher product prices 
future cash flows will be influenced by  among other factors  the number of producing wells on line  product prices and production constraints 
risk management 
the company uses financial instruments to reduce its exposure to market fluctuations in the price and transportation cost of oil and natural gas 
the company s general strategy is to hedge price and location risk with swap  collar  floor and ceiling arrangements 
when utilizing such instruments  the company strives to hedge its production back to the wellhead  to minimize basis risk 
in addition to hedging activities  the company is engaged in using the financial markets to capture trading margins 
the company has established policies with respect to open positions which limit its exposure to market risk and requires reporting to management of the potential financial exposure on a daily basis resulting from both hedging and trading activities 
hedging activities 
activities for hedging purposes are entered into by the company to manage its exposure to price and location risks in the marketing of its oil and natural gas production and  in the case of its marketing activities  third party natural gas 
gains and losses on hedging positions are deferred and recognized in the period the underlying physical transactions occur in oil and natural gas sales and trading and transportation revenues for third party natural gas 
the company has entered into the following forward sales and swap arrangements with respect to its natural gas production for the quarters indicated below total average daily natural gas production for the quarter ended december  was  mcf day average daily volume average price period hedged mcfd for the period st quarter  nd quarter  rd quarter  october   the company has hedged through collar arrangements approximately two thirds of its oil production at a floor price of and a ceiling price of per bbl through the first quarter of additionally  with respect to the hedging of third party natural gas  the company has hedged bcf through december with offsetting physical positions at settlement prices which are based upon nymex future prices or other published indices 
trading activities 
the company engages in the trading of various energy related financial instruments which require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity  swap or other contractual arrangement 
activities for trading purposes are accounted for using the mark to market method 
under this method  changes in the market value of outstanding financial instruments are recognized as a gain or loss in the period of change on a net basis in trading and transportation revenues 
the market prices used to value these transactions reflect management s best estimate considering various factors including closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the commitments 
the values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of liquidating the company s position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions 
company policy requires that financial instrument purchase and sales contracts be balanced in terms of contract volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations 
as of december   all open positions were balanced with an offsetting position 
during  gains of  were recognized in connection with these activities and are included in trading and transportation revenues 
credit risk while notional amounts are used to express the volume of various derivative financial instruments  the amounts potentially subject to credit risk  in the event of nonperformance by the third parties  are substantially smaller 
counterparties to the swap  collar  floor and ceiling arrangements discussed above are investment grade financial institutions 
accordingly  the company does not anticipate any material impact to its financial position or results of operations as a result of nonperformance by the third parties on financial instruments related to hedging activities or trading activities 
interest rate swaps 
during the second quarter of  the company entered into an interest rate exchange agreement with a financial institution to hedge its interest rate on million of the company s borrowings at through may under the terms of the agreement  the difference between the company s fixed rate of and the three month libor rate plus is received or paid by the company 
the company  through the merger  assumed interest rate exchange agreements with two financial institutions to hedge its interest rate on a total of million of the company s borrowings at rates ranging from to for through under the terms of these agreements  the difference between the company s fixed rate and the three month libor rate is received or paid by the company 
contingencies in may  the company was named as a respondent by the united states environmental protection agency the epa in an administrative order brought under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra by the epa against the owner operator of an oilfield production water evaporation facility 
based on its evaluation of the above matters  and after consideration of reserves established  the company believes the resolution of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

although the company believes that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct or that the company will take any actions that may presently be planned 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the company 
see item properties oil and gas reserves 
many factors may affect the company s expectations and plans 
capital expenditure and financing plans may change in connection with the success of drilling activities  the general availability of capital  interest rates  and cash flow available from operations 
cash flow available from operations may change depending on costs of materials and services  regulatory burdens and commodity prices 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile  and there are several potentially significant adverse effects to the company which can result if product prices decline materially 
first  lower product prices will adversely impact the company s cash flow and could cause the company to i curtail its capital program  ii borrow additional amounts under its revolving credit agreement  or iii issue additional debt or equity securities 
second  lower product prices could cause the borrowing base under the company s bank credit agreement to be reduced and certain covenant tests to be adversely affected 
third  under rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission  companies that follow the full cost accounting method are required to make quarterly ceiling test calculations 
lower product prices adversely impact the ceiling calculation 
should the company realize sustained lower product prices  it could be required to write down its oil and gas properties  resulting in a non cash charge against earnings 
certain additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s forward looking statements are disclosed under business  properties  other portions of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this k report and in the company s k report filed february  all subsequent written or oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the factors mentioned above

estimated future net revenues 
revenues from production of oil and natural gas  net of all production related taxes  lease operating expenses and capital costs 
exploitation well or exploitation drilling 
drilling of wells in areas of known production 
however  because of geologic  reservoir and other characteristics it is possible that an exploitation well may not encounter commercial quantities of reserves 
therefore such wells carry somewhat greater risk than development drilling 
oil and gas reserves associated with exploitation wells are not typically considered to be proved 
exploratory well or exploratory drilling 
a well drilled to find and produce oil or gas in an unproved area  to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir  or to extend a known reservoir beyond existing defined limits 
farmout

hydraulic fracturing 
a mechanical technique used to enhance productivity and ultimate reserve recovery 
fluids and a proppant are injected into a particular reservoir at rates and pressure sufficient to create a series of fractures or cracks in that reservoir 
increased density  or infill  drilling 
somewhat similar to development drilling  increased density drilling involves wells drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to a zone known to be productive 
however  infill drilling generally involves an increase in well density based on engineering and geological studies which demonstrate that the existing well density does not adequately drain the reservoir

proved reserves 
the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved undeveloped location 
a site on which a development well can be drilled consistent with local spacing rules for the purpose of recovering proved reserves 
proved undeveloped reserves 
reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion
