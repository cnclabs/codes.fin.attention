item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general at june  the company had total assets of million  total deposits of million and stockholders equity of million  representing of total assets 
this compares to total assets of million  total deposits of and stockholders equity of million at june  this represents a increase in total assets and a increase in stockholders equity during the fiscal year 
all historical earnings per share data herein reflect a common stock dividend paid to shareholders on may  the southern california economy and real estate markets in the company s primary lending area have shown improvement during the year  especially in income property values 
the company s level of nonperforming assets declined from june   both in dollars and as a percentage of total assets 
the company currently includes nonaccrual loans or more days past due less any specific allowances on these loans  troubled debt restructured loans and reo in determining its level of nonperforming assets 
although many financial institutions do not consider a loan nonperforming until it is or more days past due  the company ceases to accrue interest after loan payments are days past due in an effort to recognize problem assets sooner 
at june   the company reported million in nonperforming assets in the company s portfolio compared to million and million at june  and  respectively 
the company recorded provisions for loan losses of million for the year ended june  compared to million and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
see business allowances for loan and real estate losses 
problem assets nonperforming assets have been reduced by more than since the peak levels following the northridge earthquake in the company s ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was   and at june    and  respectively 
the company attributes the decrease in its nonperforming loans primarily to the disposition of real estate acquired through foreclosure 
this includes some real estate properties damaged in the northridge earthquake in january although the company has been able to reduce nonperforming assets over the last several quarters  there are no assurances that nonperforming assets will not increase in the future resulting in possible increases in provisions for loan losses 
results of operations general 
the company reported net earnings of million  per share  for the year ended june   compared to net earnings of million  per share and million  per share for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this decrease in earnings for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the one time saif special assessment offset by an increase in net interest income 
the special assessment resulted in the association accruing million in operating expenses during the first quarter of fiscal and paying this amount during the second quarter 
excluding the effects of the special saif assessment  net earnings for fiscal would have been million  per share 
the increase in earnings in fiscal over is primarily due to an increase in the net interest margin during fiscal interest income 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended june    and  respectively 
the million increase in interest income in compared to resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets of million while the average yield on interest earnings assets remained unchanged 
the million increase in interest income in compared to resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets of million  and an increase in the average yield on interest earning assets of to 
interest expense 
interest expense was million  million  and million for the years ended june    and  respectively 
the million increase in compared to resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million partially offset by a reduction in the average cost on interest bearing liabilities of to 
the million increase in compared to resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million  as well as an increase in the average cost on interest bearing liabilities of to 
net interest income before provision for loan losses 
net interest income before provision for loan losses was million  million  and million for the years ended june    and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily a result of the increase in interest earning assets relative to interest bearing liabilities during the year 
the increase in compared to was primarily a result of the net interest margin increasing to from during the year 
provision for loan losses 
during   and the company established million  million and  respectively  of provisions for losses on loans 
the increase of  in compared to and the increase of million in compared to was necessary in order to replenish the allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes to be adequate due to charge offs taken during those years 
management considers the level of nonperforming assets  the regional economic conditions and relevant real estate values and other factors when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss 
the southern california economy and real estate markets in the company s primary lending area has shown improvement during the year  especially in income property values and management considers the level of allowance for loan losses at june  to be adequate 
however  even though the local economy is showing signs of improvement  there can be no assurance that nonperforming assets will not increase and that the company may have to establish additional loss provisions in the future 
other income 
other income increased by  or  in to million as compared to there were increases in transactional fee income for deposits and loans due to a larger loan and deposit base 
gains on the sale of loans and fees received for servicing loans increased during the year as well 
other income increased by  or in to million as compared to fee income for deposits and loans serviced increased due to a larger loan and deposit base in fiscal in addition  commissions from the sale on noninsured deposit products increased due to improved sales volumes 
other expense 
other expense increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase is primarily due to the million one time special saif assessment during the fiscal year 
in september  federal legislation which recapitalized the saif fund through a one time special assessment for all thrifts was enacted 
saif is a part of the federal deposit insurance corporation 
the special assessment was based on the association s deposits as of march  at an assessment rate of basis points 
during the quarter ended september   the association accrued million in expense for this special assessment and paid this amount during the second quarter of fiscal beginning january   the annual amount the association pays for deposit insurance was reduced to basis points from basis points 
compensation and employee benefits increased  or in as compared to due to increases in salaries and expenses related to the employees stock ownership plan esop 
companies that established an esop after are required to account for the expense of the esop at the fair value of the related shares released 
due to the overall increase in the fair value of the qcbc stock during the past few quarters  esop expense has shown a corresponding increase 
the expense related to the esop was   and  for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
fdic insurance decreased  in compared to the previous year due to the reduction of the deposit insurance premium that went into effect january the following is a summary of other general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended june  in thousands professional fees advertising and promotional bank service charges miscellaneous loan expenses consulting fees other    income taxes 
income taxes decreased by  from million in to million in the decrease in taxes is due to the lower net earnings before income taxes in compared to due to the one time saif special assessment during fiscal income taxes increased by million from million in to million in the increase is due to the increase in earnings before income taxes 
the effective tax rate was  and for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate in as compared to is primarily a result of the increase in the fair value of qcbc stock over the year 
this resulted in the aforementioned increase in esop expense for financial statement purposes relative to the income tax deduction which is required to be taken at the cost basis of the shares released 
the increase in the effective tax rate in as compared to is a result of a state of california tax benefit allowed for the los angeles revitalization zone 
financial condition the company s consolidated assets totaled million at june   compared to million at june  stockholders equity totaled million at june  compared to million june  the increase in assets is primarily attributable to the implementation of the company s growth strategies funded by retail deposit promotions and fhlb advances 
loans and mbs including assets held or available for sale increased to million at june   from million at june  loans originated and purchased for investment decreased to million for the year ended june   compared to million for the same period the previous year 
mbs purchased for investment increased to million at june   from million for the same period the previous year 
at june   the company s multifamily loan portfolio totaled million or of total loans 
of the company s million of charge offs in fiscal  million or were for multifamily loans 
see business allowances for loan and real estate losses 
multifamily loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk and to be more vulnerable to deteriorating economic conditions than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
these loans typically involve higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of such loans generally depend on the income produced by the operation or sale of the property being sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 
even though the southern california real estate market is showing signs of improvement  recessionary economic conditions of the type that have prevailed in recent years in the company s primary lending market area tend to result in higher vacancy and reduced rental rates and net operating incomes from multifamily properties 
loan sales increased to million for the year ended june   compared to million for the same period ended june  the increase in loan sales is primarily a result of an increase in funding of fixed rate loans that were generally held for sale during this period 
loans serviced for others increased to million at june  from million at june  primarily due to the increase in fixed rate loans sold servicing retained 
capital resources and liquidity regulatory capital requirements firrea and implementing ots capital regulations require the association to maintain certain minimum tangible  core and risk based regulatory capital levels 
the following table summarizes the regulatory capital requirements for the association at june  as indicated in the table  the association s capital levels exceed all three of the currently applicable minimum capital requirements 
june  tangible risk based capital core capital capital amount amount amount dollars in thousands regulatory capital    required minimum    excess capital    in addition  fdicia required the ots to implement a system of regulatory sanctions against institutions that are not adequately capitalized  with the sanctions growing more severe the lower the institution s capital 
under fdicia  the ots issued regulations establishing five separate capital categories well capitalized 
adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized  differentiated by core capital ratio  level of core capital to risk weighted assets and risk based capital ratio 
see business regulation and supervision prompt corrective action requirements 
an institution is treated as well capitalized if its core capital ratio is at least  its ratio of core capital to risk based assets is at least and its risk based capital ratio is at least 
the following table summarizes the capital ratios of the well capitalized category and the association s regulatory capital at june  as compared to such ratios 
as indicated in the table  the association s capital levels exceeded the three minimum capital ratios of the well capitalized category

at june   a total of  shares had been repurchased at prices ranging from to per share 
in   shares had been repurchased under a previous repurchase plan 
the company may complete the repurchase of shares over the next several months 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company announced a common stock dividend paid to shareholders on may  the decrease in the company s book value per share reflects the effect of the stock dividend  partially offset by the reduced number of shares outstanding resulting from the stock repurchase program and the company s earnings 
sources of funds and liquidity sources of capital and liquidity for the company include distributions from the association and borrowings  such as repurchase transactions 
dividends and other capital distributions from the association are subject to regulatory restrictions 
see business regulation and supervision savings and loan holding company regulation payment of dividends and other capital distributions by association and market for the registrant s common equity and related stockholder matter 
the association s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  proceeds from the sale of loans and advances from the fhlb 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
although competition for deposits in the southern california area is substantial  the association experienced an increase in deposits in fiscal the association also has other potential sources of liquidity  such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase and liquidating existing short term assets 
the association has continued to maintain the required minimum levels of liquid assets as defined by ots regulations 
this requirement  which may be varied at the direction of the ots depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the required ratio is currently 
the association s average liquidity ratios were   and  at june    and  respectively 
management currently attempts to maintain a liquidity ratio as close to the minimum as possible 
liquidity levels reflect management s strategy to invest excess liquidity in higher yielding interest earning assets such as loans or mortgage backed securities 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the association paid million for the one time special saif assessment charged to all thrifts during the fiscal year 
the payment of this assessment did not have a significant impact on the liquidity and capital resources of the association 
see business regulation and supervision deposit insurance 
the company s cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities consisted primarily of cash flows from the sale of loans held for sale which totaled million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the company originated loans for sale of million  million  and million during fiscal years   and  respectively 
net cash used by investing activities consisted primarily of loan originations and investment purchases  offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from principal reductions on mbs and maturities of other investment securities 
loans originated and purchased for investment were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
proceeds from maturities and principal payments of investment securities were million  million  and million for fiscal years ended   and  respectively 
net cash used by financing activities consisting primarily of net activity in deposit accounts and proceeds from funding and repayments of fhlb advances 
the net change in deposits was an increase of million for fiscal  and increase of million for fiscal  and an increase of million for fiscal the net proceeds repayments from fhlb advances were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
due to the company s growth strategies in fiscal   and  the company s use of fhlb advances increased 
at june   the company had million in advances outstanding from the fhlb advances that the company had outstanding at any month end was million 
at june   the amount of additional credit available from the fhlb was million 
management anticipates increased borrowing from the fhlb again in fiscal see business sources and funds borrowings 
liquidity levels were maintained in fiscal with a higher level of reliance on short term borrowings 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at june   cash and short term investments totaled million 
at june   the company had outstanding commitments to originate loans of million and commitments to purchase loans of million 
at june   the company had million of approved undisbursed lines of credit 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination and purchase commitments 
certificates of deposits which have contractual maturities in one year or less from june   totaled million 
if a significant portion of the maturing certificates are not renewed at maturity  the company s other sources of liquidity include fhlb advances and other borrowings  such as repurchase transactions 
the company could also choose to pay higher rates to maintain maturing deposits  which could result in increased cost of funds 
historically  the company has maintained a significant portion of maturing deposits 
while management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the current competitive rate environment  these are not expected to have a material impact on the long term liquidity position of the company 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
the company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using several tools 
one measure of the company s exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the company s maturity and rate sensitivity analysis under the asset liability management caption 
another measure  required to be performed by ots regulated institutions  is the test specified by ots thrift bulletin no 
 interest rate risk management 
this test measures the impact on net interest income and on net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
following are the estimated impacts of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels at june   calculated in compliance with thrift bulletin no 
percentage change in change in interest rates in basis points net interest income net portfolio value the percentage change is this column represents net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change is this column represents net portfolio value of the association in a stable interest rate environment versus the net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while structuring the company s asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
the company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
the company continually evaluates interest rate risk management opportunities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
management believes that hedging instruments currently available are not cost effective  and therefore  has focused its efforts on increasing the company s yield cost spread through wholesale and retail growth opportunities 
the following table shows the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at june  market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on and off balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments 
expected maturity principal repayment june  average interest total fair rate thereafter balance value dollars in thousands interest sensitive assets fed funds sold and other short term investments    loans receivable one to four family         multifamily and non residential         other   mortgage backed securities         investment securities

total balance equals the notional amount of off balance sheet items and interest rates are the weighted average interest rates of the underlying loans 
expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments of principal 
the company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments and prepayments of principal 
the prepayment experience reflected herein is based on the company s historical experience 
the company s average constant prepayment rate cpr on its total fixed rate portfolio is  and on its adjustable rate portfolio for interest earning assets excluding investment securities  which do not have prepayment features 
for deposit liabilities  in accordance with standard industry practice and the company s own historical experience  decay factors  used to estimate deposit runoff of   and between and for passbook  checking and money market deposit accounts  respectively 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from the company s historical experience 
asset liability management the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of falling interest rates therefore  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap theoretically may be adversely affected due to its interest earning assets repricing to a greater extent than its interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  during a period of rising interest rates  theoretically  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap position may increase as it is able to invest in higher yielding interest earning assets at a more rapid rate than its interest bearing liabilities reprice 
in addition  a positive gap may not protect an institution with a large portfolio of arm loans from increases in interest rates for extended time periods as such instruments generally have periodic and lifetime interest rate caps 
additionally  the company s arm loans are predominantly tied to cofi  a lagging market index  and rapid increases in interest rates could have a negative impact on the company s earnings 
accordingly  interest rates and the resulting cost of funds increases in a rapidly increasing rate environment could exceed the cap levels on these instruments and negatively impact net interest income 
declining interest rates have  in general  benefited the company primarily due to the effect of the lagging market index which has resulted in interest income declining at a slower rate than interest expense 
this effect of the lagging index has been partially offset by the increase in refinancings of portfolio loans to lower yielding loans 
the company has managed its interest rate risk through the aggressive marketing and funding of arm loans  which generally reprice at least semi annually and are generally indexed to cofi 
as a result of this strategy  and based upon the assumptions used in the table set forth below  at june   the company s total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year exceeded its total interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in the same time by million  representing a one year cumulative positive gap ratio of 
this compares to million at june   which represented a positive gap ratio of 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company ceased its origination of cofi arm multifamily and commercial loan origination 
new multifamily and commercial loan originations are tied to a treasury based index or are fixed rate for years then adjusted to a new year fixed rate also based upon a treasury index 
the company closely monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies 
the association s board of directors has established an asset liability committee  responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which generally meets weekly and reports to the board of directors on interest rate risk and trends on a quarterly basis 
the company s cumulative gap position is at a level satisfactory to management 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to maintain its positive gap position or that its strategies will not result in a negative gap position in the future 
the level of the movement of interest rates  up or down  is an uncertainty and could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
the company does not currently engage in the use of trading activities  high risk derivatives and synthetic instruments or hedging activities in controlling its interest rate risk 
such uses are permitted at the recommendation of the asset liability committee with the approval of the board of directors  however  the company does not anticipate engaging in such practices in the immediate future 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at june   which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
additionally  the company utilized deposit decay rate assumptions of for passbook accounts  for checking accounts and to for money market deposit accounts in the one year or less category 
the range of decay rates for money market deposit accounts is due to the market rate sensitivity of various money market checking accounts 
these decay rates are based upon the company s historical experience  but there is no assurance that the assumed rates will correspond to future rates

interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between net interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their arm loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services
