item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discussion of financial information net income for was million compared to million in and million in net income for was million prior to an accounting change for statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas resulting in a million reduction to net income 
earnings per common share in were 
earnings per common share in  after sfas  were compared to in stockholders equity was billion or per common share  in compared to billion  or per common share  in and billion  or per common share  in the increase in stockholders equity in  and was attributable to net income less annual dividends of per share in  per share in and per share in sales and other operating revenues for were billion compared to billion in and billion in the increase in was primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices  higher refined product prices and higher chemical volumes 
total assets in were billion 
total assets in and were billion 
the increase in was principally due to capital expenditures exceeding depreciation  depletion and amortization  additional investments in affiliates  and an increase in receivables 
cost of raw materials and products purchased increased in primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices and higher chemical volumes 
direct operating expenses as a percent of sales and other operating revenues were relatively constant for  and selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense decreased in from and because of lower interest rates  refinancing activities and lower average debt outstanding 
interest and other income for is a loss of million compared to an million loss in and a million gain in for and  the gain or the loss was primarily associated with asset sales of exploration and production properties 
long term balance sheet obligations less current installments were million at year end  compared to million at year end and million at the end of total balance sheet debt was million at year end compared to million at year end and million at year end the increase in was primarily due to the termination of million of off balance sheet financing which consisted of an million accounts receivable sale and a million guaranteed cos mar joint venture borrowing from a bank which was replaced with an additional investment by the company 
during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  sfas which resulted in a before tax addition of  to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
after tax  the additional charge was  or per share 
under sfas  the company now evaluates impairment of exploration and production assets on a field by field basis rather than using a one country cost center for its proved properties 
on this basis  certain fields are impaired because they are not expected to recover their entire book value from future cash flows 
the value of certain marketing assets in the company s downstream business were also impaired under sfas as a result  the company recognized a non cash  pre tax charge of  related to its exploration and production assets and  related to its marketing assets 
the fair values of the impaired assets were determined by using the present value of expected future cash flows for the oil and gas properties and sales prices for similar assets for marketing assets 
if estimated future cash flows are not achieved with respect to certain fields  further writedowns may be required 
crude oil  refined products and chemical inventories are priced at the lower of cost last in  first out  lifo or market on an aggregate basis 
materials and supplies are priced at average cost  not in excess of market  in the case of material salvaged  an allowance is made for obsolescence 
the excess of replacement cost of crude oil and refined products and chemicals over lifo cost at december  was approximately million and million at december  the impact of the various lines of business on the financial position and results of operations is discussed in the following text under appropriate operating unit subheadings 
exploration and production and natural gas marketing revenues and earnings loss before interest and income tax were million and million  million and million  and million and million for  and  respectively 
increased net earnings in were due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices  higher production volumes  lower lifting costs  higher natural gas marketing earnings and the effect of the sfas charge of taken in average crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids production was net million barrels in  an increase from net million barrels in natural gas production in was billion cubic feet and billion cubic feet in average wellhead prices for crude rose per barrel to in average wellhead prices for natural gas were per mcf in  up from per mcf in increased drilling activity resulted in record reserve additions of million barrels of oil equivalent 
finding and development costs in were per barrel oil equivalent  compared to in lifting costs  at per barrel oil equivalent  were improved from in the company participated in gross exploratory wells  compared to in and in the success rate was compared to in and in the company s participation in net exploratory wells was  compared with in and in the success rate for net exploratory wells was compared to in and in natural gas marketing sales volumes of million cubic feet per day in increased from million cubic feet per day in refining  supply and transportation and marketing revenues and earnings loss before interest and income tax were billion and million  billion and million and billion and million for  and  respectively 
lower results during were primarily due to lower industry fuels and aromatics margins and increased turnaround activity at both refineries 
these factors were partially offset by improved yields and plant operations 
was the fifth consecutive year of low gulf coast industry margins primarily due to increased supplies attributed to debottlenecking of industry upgrading capacity and increased imports 
lower aromatics margins generally reflected increased supplies from reducing aromatics in gasoline and increased extraction capacity 
refinery operations in included a throughput of  barrels per day 
throughput was limited by scheduled major turnarounds at the port arthur  texas refinery and in the big spring  texas refinery which occurs only once every four years  and by product pipeline constraints 
at the big spring  texas refinery  a major fluid catalytic cracking unit enhancement improved yields of higher value products  but the financial benefits were generally offset by the planned turnaround 
chemicals revenues and earnings before interest and income taxes were billion and million  billion and million and million and million for  and  respectively 
chemicals was the largest contributor to earnings  although down from due to a drop in industry margins reflecting new capacity additions only partially offset by higher volumes 
record production was achieved at all sites  styrene was up  polystyrene up  polypropylene up and polyethylene up 
total chemical sales volumes were up versus the prior year reflecting the higher production levels and major expansion projects at the polypropylene and polystyrene plants 
in mid june  a million pound per year crystal polystyrene production line was completed  making the carville  louisiana polystyrene plant the largest polystyrene plant in the world 
at the polypropylene plant in laporte  texas  a million pound per year expansion started up at the end of  making it the largest polypropylene plant in the world  and it operated in a sold out position throughout the year 
capacity was doubled at the joint venture propylene splitter plant near houston 
project implementation began on an expansion of the high density polyethylene plant near houston that will double the facility s production capacity when completed in mid engineering also began on another expansion at the polypropylene plant which could further increase capacity by million pounds in late environmental matters the company was contingently liable at december   under pending lawsuits and other claims  some of which involved substantial sums 
considering certain liabilities or reserves that have been set up for the lawsuits and claims  and the difficulty in determining the ultimate liability in some of these matters  internal counsel is of the opinion that the amounts  if any  that ultimately might be due in connection with such lawsuits and claims would not have a material adverse effect upon the company s consolidated financial condition 
the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these regulations  which are currently changing  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require the company to incur future obligations to investigate the effects of the release or disposal of certain petroleum  chemical and mineral substances at various sites  to remediate or restore these sites  to compensate others for damage to property and natural resources and for remediation and restoration costs 
these possible obligations relate to sites owned by the company or others and associated with past or present operations  including sites at which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws 
the company is currently participating in environmental investigations  assessments and cleanups under these regulations at federal superfund and state managed sites  as well as other cleanup sites  including operating and closed refineries  chemical facilities  service stations  pipelines and terminals 
the company may in the future be involved in additional environmental investigations  assessments and cleanups 
the magnitude of future costs will depend on factors such as the unknown nature of contamination at many sites  the unknown timing  extent and method of the remedial actions which may be required and the determination of the company s liability in proportion to other responsible parties 
environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized depending on their future economic benefit 
expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that have no future economic benefit are expensed 
liabilities for expenditures of a noncapital nature are recorded when environmental assessment and or remediation is probable  and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company has accrued for environmental remediation obligations of  and  at december  and  respectively 
substantially all amounts accrued are expected to be paid out over the next five to six years 
the level of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations is impossible to determine with any degree of reliability 
the company spent approximately  and  at december  and  respectively  in capital expenditures for environmental protection and for compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
in addition  the company expensed  and  in and  respectively  for ongoing environmental administration and maintenance activities at operating facilities 
the company also paid  for superfund taxes in total environmental cash expenditures are expected to increase over an extended period of time 
estimated environmental capital expenditures for are  capital resources and liquidity the company s cash liquidity requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt interest over the past three years were financed primarily by a combination of funds generated from operations  borrowings and dispositions of assets 
operating cash flows  defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization and lease impairment ebitda  was million in compared to million in and million in the increase in operating cash flows compared to and are the result of increased operating profits by the company due to improved chemical profits in and higher upstream profits in during  cash provided by operating activities totaled million  compared with million in and million in cash flow from operating activities during increased million compared to the prior year primarily resulting from a million reduction of working capital and a million improvement to earnings prior to the non cash impact of sfas cash flow from operating activities during decreased million compared to primarily due to the termination of the million account receivable sale and a million increase in working capital in compared to the million decrease in working capital in the company s year end balance sheet debt was million compared to million at year end and million at year end the increase in debt during was primarily due to the termination of the million of off balance sheet financing 
during  debt was reduced primarily with proceeds from the sale of assets and funds from operations 
the majority stockholder of the company has not been the principal lender in the past three years 
in july  the company offered initial public debt of million five year notes at market rates 
the proceeds were used to refinance debt at lower costs 
the public debt was registered with the securities and exchange commission on form s in june and carried credit ratings of single a from standard poor s and a from moody s investors service 
the company replaced its short term bank borrowings with a million commercial paper program supported fully by its unused revolving credit facility in the third quarter of in  the company entered into long term note agreements with certain insurance companies that provided for unsecured borrowings aggregating million under series a  series b  and series c senior notes 
proceeds from these notes were used to repay other debt 
the company has an unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks in the amount of million 
under the facility  the company has available credit in an amount of million through february the company paid dividends of per share in  per share in and per share in the company believes that cash provided by operations  together with borrowings available under the revolving credit facility with banks  will be sufficient to fund the company s working capital requirements  capital expenditures  principal  interest and dividends 
capital expenditures in thousands exploration  production and natural gas    refining  supply and transportation and marketing    chemicals    corporate and other    total    capital expenditures were above the projected capital expenditures budget in is million 
impact of inflation and changing prices the business of the company is not seasonal but is sensitive to crude oil and natural gas pricing  margins between crude oil and refined products and chemical margins 
inflation impacts the company by increasing costs of labor and supplies  and increasing costs of acquiring and replacing property  plant and equipment 
the replacement cost of property  plant and equipment is generally greater than the historical cost as a result of inflation 
market conditions continue to be the primary factor in determining the prices and costs of company products
