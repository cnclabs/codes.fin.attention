net sales in fiscal reflect an increase of approximately million compared to fiscal  with approximately million generated by the automotive segment a increase and approximately million generated by the industrial segment a increase 
reflecting the effects of acquisitions during the periods  most significantly the purolator acquisition  the sales increase on a pro forma basis was approximately million  with approximately million generated by the automotive segment a increase and million generated by the industrial segment a increase 
the pro forma sales increase in the automotive segment for fiscal was led by growth in markets outside of the us of approximately  with the majority of the increase occurring in both the aftermarket and oem markets in europe 
the segment s sales in the us were relatively flat in fiscal in both the segment s aftermarket and oem markets 
the pro forma sales increase in the industrial segment for fiscal was attributable to significant growth of approximately in the segment s european markets  and in the segment s us markets 
cost of products sold as a percentage of consolidated net sales were   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage of costs from fiscal is primarily the result of the purolator acquisition  due to its historically lower gross margin 
on a pro forma basis including purolator for the entire fiscal year  such costs were for fiscal this level of costs indicates the negative pressures on the margins experienced by both of the company s business segments  a portion of which has been substantially offset by the positive effects of the company s cost control and cycle time reduction programs 
it is anticipated that the company s current restructuring program will have a beneficial effect on the level of such costs by the end of fiscal or early fiscal selling and administration costs as a percentage of consolidated net sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the reduction in the percentage of costs from fiscal are partially the result of the purolator acquisition  which had a lower level of such costs 
on a pro forma basis  including purolator for the entire fiscal year  such costs were for fiscal the reduced level of costs also reflects operating efficiencies achieved from the integration of the purolator business and the reorganization of the company s business segments 
the lower level of costs also indicates that the company s continued emphasis on cost control and cycle time reduction has been successful in offsetting the impact of inflation on such costs 
research and development costs increased by million in fiscal over fiscal  which in turn increased by million over fiscal the increases are primarily due to the acquisition of imperial eastman and fitzsimons for fiscal and purolator for fiscal as a percentage of consolidated net sales  such costs were in each of fiscal  and this consistent level of investment reflects the company s continuing emphasis on new product development 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in fiscal over fiscal  which in turn increased by million over fiscal the increases are attributable to the acquisition of imperial eastman and fitzsimons for fiscal and purolator for fiscal  as well as the increased level of capital equipment expenditures in the past two years

the effect of this charge  after taxes  reduced income from continuing operations by million  or per fully diluted share of common stock 
interest expense in fiscal increased million over fiscal  which in turn increased million over fiscal the increase in fiscal is primarily the result of increased borrowings required to finance the imperial eastman and fitzsimons acquisitions 
the increase in fiscal represents the net effects of increased borrowings to finance the purolator acquisition  substantially offset as a result of the financing transactions referred to previously under liquidity and capital resources  as well as lower interest rates resulting from the company s improved debt to total capitalization position 
the company s provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes was excluding the restructuring charge  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the higher rates in comparison to the us statutory tax rate are primarily the result of income in foreign jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates than in the us  and state and local taxes
