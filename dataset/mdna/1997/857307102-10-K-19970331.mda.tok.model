item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this annual report on form k 
in the company formed a client server division within the company to focus a major portion of the company s product development effort on the emerging client server technology 
in july  the company enhanced this division by transitioning the employees of systems engineering group  a michigan corporation that had significant experience in the support and development of high end accounting products for the client server market  to become state of the art employees 
this transition was done to augment the development effort of its acuity financials client server product line 
the company currently employs approximately development personnel in troy  michigan dedicated to the on going development of the company s acuity financials client server product line 
in addition to its internal development program  the company expands its product offerings by obtaining distribution rights or ownership of software products developed by others 
with respect to licensed products  the company provides support to its customers and has the right to obtain support from the licensor  and the licensor is responsible for maintenance and enhancement of the product 
with respect to acquisitions  responsibility for the support  maintenance and enhancement of the products is assumed by the company s internal staff 
the company actively solicits suggestions from its authorized resellers  software consultants  client advisors and end users for new products and product improvements 
these suggestions  which may be received unsolicited  or in response to the company s inquiries  or through the company s pre release product testing procedures  are a key source of information on which the company bases its plans for new products  and oftentimes new product features 
the company s development staff includes a quality assurance group that tests all products before they are released for sale 
this group employs test procedures and automated test procedures designed to verify the functionality of the products to the company s specifications  ensure product consistency  and verify that product documentation properly describes and corresponds to the software 
in addition  all new product releases and major enhancement releases are beta tested  whereby the product is tested at selected outside sites over an extended period of time  using a testing schedule designed by the company 
the microcomputer software industry is characterized by rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
the company s success will depend primarily on the continued market acceptance of its existing products  the company s ability to enhance its existing products and the company s ability to develop and introduce new products that meet both the changing needs of business and the changing industry standards with respect to operating environments and hardware platforms 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to avoid obsolescence of its products 
unexpected delays in completing or shipping products  including the company s mas client server product line or additional application modules and enhancements for mas for windows  businessworks for windows and acuity financials  or design  production or undetected product quality problems  may adversely affect the company 
there can be no assurance that any new products will be competitive or achieve market acceptance 
moreover  the manner and timing of the introduction of new products may also adversely affect sales of the company s existing product lines 
no assurance can be given that new products will be introduced in a way that will not have such an effect 
in particular  it should be noted that the mas for windows  mas client server product line and acuity financials are completely new products based on new technology 
as such  there can be no assurance that these products will or continue to be competitive and achieve dominant market acceptance 
certain competing mid range and high end accounting software products for gui environments are already in release  and many may have a competitive advantage by virtue of their earlier availability 
on the other hand  however  mas for windows in the company s opinion has already established market leadership in the mid range windows accounting marketplace by its initial wide acceptance and number of shipments of the products during while the popularity of windows  nt and other gui environments is accelerating  it is much more difficult for companies to change their accounting software than it is  for example  to change their word processing software 
as a result  businesses may switch to gui environments for all their other software applications while continuing to use their present accounting software for some period of time 
other factors that may delay the acceptance of mid range accounting applications include the limited number of competing products currently available  which hinders the ability of a business to make a purchase decision based on a comparative analysis of various products  and the fact that businesses upgrading their present systems to gui environments are faced with significant additional expenses for the hardware required to operate these environments 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s experience indicates that sales of character based mid range accounting software will continue to be in demand  but will most certainly decline since gui environments are now market standard environments 
the company is fully committed to continuing to support  maintain and enhance its mas product line for the foreseeable future 
production the production of the company s software products includes the printing of user manuals  the duplication of diskettes  assembly of purchased components and final packaging 
the printing and preparation of user manuals is performed by outside sources in accordance with the company s specifications 
the company generally performs diskette and compact disk duplication procedures  assembles purchased product components and performs final packaging internally at its irvine  california facility 
during the company transferred the former manzanita production operations for businessworks and businessworks for windows from the roseville  california facility to the irvine facility 
quality control tests are performed on finished goods by company employees 
the company generally ships the next business day after receipt of an order and has no meaningful backlog 
the principal materials used in the company s products include diskettes  binders and printed materials 
all of these materials are readily available from various vendors 
the company s products may be returned for replacement if found to be defective in materials or packaging  subject to the terms of the company s license agreement 
to date  returns of defective products have been immaterial 
competition the entry level  mid range and client server accounting software markets are highly competitive 
the company s principal competitors are other independent vendors of microcomputer accounting software 
the company believes that in its main mid range market there is no dominant market leader  but rather a significant number of medium to small sized companies that all compete for a portion of the market 
the company is of the opinion that within the nt sql client server mid range market there also is currently no dominant leader 
currently there are few accounting software vendors that offer natively designed client server solutions for microsoft s nt and sql server technology 
the company targets its potential customers for these solutions to companies with revenues in the range of twenty five to one hundred and fifty million dollars 
the company considers the entry level retail market is primarily dominated by intuit  while the high end client server market is dominated by sap whose products primarily address companies with revenues over one hundred million dollars per year 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors relevant to end users in these markets are the features and capabilities of the software  its ability to run on a variety of industry standard platforms  the breadth of and integration among the modules that make up the manufacturer s product line  the availability and quality of product support and product pricing 
the company also competes for access to its chosen channels of distribution for mid range and entry level products public accounting firms and vars 
due to the high costs associated with building the expertise necessary to sell a particular accounting software solution  the public accounting firms and vars who participate in the distribution of accounting software typically do not actively market more than one or two accounting software solutions 
the company regards the primary competitive factors relevant to attracting and retaining public accounting firms and vars are the same as those for end users but also include the protection offered against channel conflict 
the company considers that its ability to attract public accounting firms and vars is enhanced by the fact that it does not sell its mid range and entry level products through the competing retail channel or in the case of its new client server products through a direct sales force that competes with its resellers 
there can be no assurance  however  that other companies will not be more successful than the company in securing and retaining the services of resellers of accounting software 
the retail market for microcomputer accounting software is also highly competitive 
the company does not offer any products sold through retail distributors but believes entry level retail products such as those offered by intuit and other retail competitors does affect demand and increases competition on other entry level business accounting products  such as the company s businessworks product line and to a lesser degree  mas and mas for windows which is sold through professional distribution channels 
the company believes that the primary competitive factors in gaining the attention of end users is product knowledge of the reseller  brand recognition  pricing  features and support of the product 
in addition  the company faces competition for end users from outside the microcomputer accounting software market 
end users may select minicomputer or mainframe based solutions as alternatives to microcomputer systems 
further  the company competes against other methods of delivery of business accounting services  including internally developed computerized accounting systems  client write up services offered by public accounting firms  payroll and other services offered by service bureaus  and traditional manual accounting systems 
certain of the company s competitors  both inside and outside of the microcomputer accounting software market  may have greater financial  marketing and technological resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that other companies have not developed or marketed or will not develop or market software products that are superior to those of the company  that are offered at substantially lower prices than those of the company  or that have achieved or will achieve greater market acceptance than those of the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that alternate methods of delivering business accounting services will not provide increased competition in the future 
the competitive marketplace for higher end solutions such as acuity financials is often characterized by vendors offering their products through direct sales personnel 
the company is developing a high end reseller distribution channel to represent and sell the product which will need to compete with direct sales personnel from other software vendors that may have significantly more resources to reach and penetrate potential new customers 
there can be no assurances that the reseller channel the company is developing will be successful and be competitive with other vendors in the mid range client server marketplace 
proprietary rights the company s mas software products are written in a development language known as business basic and utilizes a compiler and tool development language called providex which allows the products to run either in a windows  nt or dos environment 
the company s other products are written in standard programming languages that are available from a number of sources 
the company licenses providex and related tools pursuant to an agreement effective february   with an initial term of three years 
the company regards certain features of its internal operations  software and documentation as proprietary and relies on a combination of contract  copyright  and trade secret laws and other measures to protect its proprietary information 
existing united states copyright laws afford only limited protection  and under the existing patent laws of the united states and most foreign countries  software products such as those marketed by the company generally cannot be patented 
the company s software products are shipped in shrink wrapped packages on which a notice is prominently displayed informing the end user that by breaking the seal of the packaging  the end user agrees to be bound by the license agreement contained in the package 
the license agreement includes limitations on the end user s authorized use of the product  as well as restrictions on disclosure and transferability 
the legal and practical enforceability and extent of liability for violations of license agreements that purport to become effective upon such opening of a sealed package are unclear 
the unauthorized copying and distribution of microcomputer software products is a persistent and significant concern to the company  and it attempts to monitor such activity to find more effective technological and other means of detection and deterrence 
despite the steps taken by the company to protect its software products  users may still make unauthorized copies of the company s products for their own use and for sale to others 
employees as of december  the company had a total of employees 
none of the company s employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and the company has not experienced any work stoppage 
the company believes that its employee relations are good 
the company believes its future success depends upon its ability to attract and retain skilled employees  who are in great demand 
the company has in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting sufficient numbers of trained personnel to accommodate the company s needs 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals to meet the needs of the company s business 
item properties the company s executive offices and product development and distribution center are housed in two adjacent buildings in irvine  california  containing approximately  square feet and approximately  square feet  respectively 
the company occupies the larger facility under a lease that expires in june  and occupies the smaller facility under a lease that initially expires in august  but that may be renewed at the option of the company to expire in june  the same date as its main facility 
in addition  the company occupies a facility in roseville  california  near sacramento  containing approximately  square feet  which houses product development for the businessworks and businessworks for windows products  as well as certain customer support and sales functions

the company currently occupies this facility pursuant to a lease that expires in and has an early termination option effective in the company has leased a facility in troy  michigan  containing approximately  rentable square feet 
this lease expires in march  but allows the company to extend the term of the lease for another five years 
the company uses the troy facility as the company s midwestern region client server development and support facility 
item legal proceedings the company is engaged in litigation with charles milden  who was the company s president from to this litigation commenced in december when the company filed a complaint against mr 
milden in the california superior court for orange county  seeking damages and an injunction against disclosures of the company s proprietary information by mr 
milden 
following the filing of the company s complaint against mr 
milden  mr 
milden and his wife filed a complaint against the company and other defendants  including the company s directors  ta associates  robertson  stephens company  and frank a 
barcott security investigation 
this action was also filed in the orange county  california superior court  and was consolidated with the company s action against mr 
milden

in october  mr 
milden and his wife filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court located in orange county  california 
in october  the mildens chapter proceeding was converted to a chapter  and a trustee was appointed to liquidate their estate 
the trustee and the company agreed to settle the mildens claims against the company for an amount that will be fully paid by the company s insurance carrier and that is substantially less than the litigation costs that the company would have incurred to take this matter to trial 
both the bankruptcy court and the state court have approved this settlement agreement  and on march   the state court dismissed both of the pending state court actions with prejudice 
the mildens have appealed from this dismissal 
briefing has been completed and the parties are awaiting the court s determination of a date for oral argument 
the mildens have also appealed the bankruptcy court s order approving the settlement  as well as a number of related bankruptcy court orders  to the united states district court for the central district of california  where all of the bankruptcy court s orders were upheld 
the mildens then appealed the district court s ruling to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
briefing of this appeal has also been completed  and the appeals court heard oral argument in january the appeals court has not rendered its decision 
management believes  based in part on discussions with its counsel  that the mildens appeals of the state court dismissal and bankruptcy court orders are without merit  and the company intends to vigorously contest the appeals 
the company is also engaged in litigation with rapidforms  inc in april of  rapidforms filed a complaint against the company and the company s subsidiary  manzanita  in the united states district court for the district of new jersey 
the complaint alleges that manzanita breached two written agreements under which rapidforms was to supply standard and customized printed business forms to users of manzanita s accounting software 
the original complaint further alleges that the company tortiously interfered with manzanita s contractual relations with rapidforms by causing manzanita to breach the written agreements 
the original complaint contains causes of action for breach of contract  breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing  tortious interference with contractual relations  and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage 
rapidforms seeks compensatory and punitive damages  as well as attorneys fees  interest  and court costs 
on or about july   the company and manzanita  through their attorneys in new jersey  filed answers and counterclaims  in which the companies deny liability and assert that rapidforms breached its obligations under the two written agreements by  among other things  failing to pay commissions due and owing to manzanita 
the counterclaim seeks damages as well as an accounting of previously paid and past due commissions owing to manzanita 
the company intends to continue to defend the plaintiff s claims  and to prosecute the company s claims  vigorously

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was formed in to develop  produce and market microcomputer accounting software 
the company shipped its first product in and in introduced its first product for ibm and compatible microcomputers 
from through the company sold its products predominantly through the retail distribution channel 
in the company introduced a new product line  mas  which had substantially improved technical features and accounting functions 
at the same time  the company changed its distribution channel from retail computer stores to vars and public accounting firms 
since the company has increased revenues over each subsequent year 
on december   state of the art merged under a pooling of interests business combination with manzanita and the financial results presented reflect the combined operations of both companies 
in the most recent year ended december   the company s consolidated net revenues increased  or to  as compared to consolidated net revenues of  in the company has been profitable for the past ten years 
for the period ended december   the company s consolidated net income was  a decrease of  or when compared to consolidated net income of  in for the past four years the company has significantly increased its research and development expense to bring new graphics and client server accounting products to market 
in the company began shipping two new product lines  mas for windows and acuity financials  designed for the windows and windows nt operating system environments 
the company believes that these new product lines will produce continued revenue growth for the company 
forward looking information this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  including  without limitation  statements concerning the company s product development and product release plans  future research and development  sales and marketing expenditures and future revenue growth 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ from those projected 
these risks and uncertainties include technological risks involved in the development and testing of new products  the impact of competitive products and pricing  and the uncertainties of which operating systems and hardware platforms will dominate  and which emerging technologies could impact the demand for the company s products 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net revenues for each of the years in the three year period ended december  year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative merger and acquisition costs total operating expenses operating income interest income income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net revenues 
consolidated net revenues in increased  or  to  as compared to consolidated net revenues of  and in consolidated net revenues increased  or  when compared to consolidated net revenues of  in the increase in consolidated net revenues was primarily the result of increased software license revenues from the mas for windows and acuity financials product lines combined with increases in support and business forms revenues 
license revenues from the company s businessworks  flexware and macp l product lines decreased  or in as compared to the company sold its apple product lines  flexware and macp l  in the second quarter of and no longer offers accounting products for the apple operating systems 
in the businessworks product line increased  or as compared to apple products decreased in by  or when compared to in the company introduced mas for windows and acuity financials  two new graphic product lines  which produced  or of the company s revenue for the year 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease of  or in the company s flagship mas character product line  which runs under the dos operating system  when compared to the company believes that the new generation graphic product lines of mas for windows and acuity financials will grow at a rapid rate that will outpace the anticipated decline from the older mas for dos product line 
acuity financials  a natively designed nt sql client server product line  was released in october and contributed  or of the company s revenue in software license revenues accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues in as compared to in and in the increase in consolidated net revenues in was primarily the result of increased license  support and business forms revenues 
license revenues from mas and businessworks in increased  or over to  and accounted for of the company s total revenues as compared to of the company s revenues in service revenues increased  or as compared to and business forms revenues increased  or to  and accounted for of the company s total revenues in as compared to of the company s revenues in service revenues in increased  or to  when compared to business forms revenues of  in increased  or over and accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues as compared to of the total company s revenues in the increase in business forms and support revenues was the result of increased unit volume 
the increase in license fee revenues in was positively impacted as a result of increased pricing for the mas and mas for windows products that were introduced in june acuity financials  a new product line which addresses a significantly higher priced market segment than the company s traditional mas and businessworks product lines produced  in revenue for and was the result of increased unit volume 
the company no longer offers entry level products sold through retail distribution channels 
the company s revenue and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of new product introductions  product upgrade revenues  commencement of sales and marketing promotions  seasonality of customer buying trends and general economic conditions 
the company operates with no significant backlog  thereby making quarterly revenue and associated operating results difficult to forecast 
in the last twenty four quarters  the company s revenue pattern indicates that revenue and normal operating income  before non recurring charges and accruals  have been materially higher in the fourth quarter than in the other three quarters of the year 
this historically higher revenue volume and associated operating income in the fourth quarter has been largely due to two factors higher end user demand for the company s software products as customers prepare to automate their businesses at the beginning of each new year  and the release of the company s annual payroll tax update program 
management believes this pattern will continue in cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of documentation  packaging  diskettes  royalties  software development amortization and associated manufacturing  labor and overhead costs 
in cost of revenues were of net revenues as compared to of net revenues in  a decrease of two percentage points 
the decrease was primarily the result of lower material and production costs than in the decrease in material and production costs  expressed as a percentage of net revenues  in was principally due to less expensive package design on a per unit basis and higher pricing on the mas and acuity product lines than in in cost of revenues increased one percentage point to as compared to in and was the result of higher royalty and material costs than in while the company continues to pursue cost reduction opportunities whenever practicable  there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain its current level of cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses primarily include compensation for the company s sales  marketing  customer service and product support staffs  advertising costs and other related expenses 
sales and marketing expenses in were of net revenues  an increase of seven percentage points from of net revenues in this represented a dollar increase of  and a percentage increase of over expenses and was primarily the result of increased costs for salaries and benefits  contract labor  advertising and lead generation activities  promotional events and direct overhead costs 
in  sales and marketing personnel costs increased approximately or  over similar levels in and was the result of increased salaries and benefit costs  rather than headcount increases 
advertising and lead generation expense in increased or  over and was primarily related to the launch of new products into the marketplace and a new emphasis on identifying potential end users 
the cost of promotional events held by the company increased  and general corporate overhead expenses increased  over similar costs in contract labor and travel and entertainment costs primarily accounted for the remaining increase in sales and marketing costs in in sales and marketing expenses  at of net revenues  decreased one percentage point from of net revenues in this represented a dollar increase of  and a percentage increase of over expenses  and was primarily the result of increased costs for salaries and benefits  contract labor  promotional events and direct overhead costs 
in salaries and benefits increased or  over and was primarily the result of increased headcount which grew by over the prior year 
promotional event costs increased  over similar costs in  while additional expenses incurred in contract labor and direct overhead costs primarily accounted for the remaining increase 
the company believes that substantial investments in sales and marketing  including customer service and product support  are important to its revenue growth 
accordingly  the company expects these expenses to continue to be significant 
in  the company plans to increase expenses for advertising and lead generation activities and customer support expense to provide increased levels of customer satisfaction 
research and development 
research and development expenses in  net of capitalized software development costs  increased or  to of net revenues  as compared to  or of net revenues in and  or of net revenues in the increase in research and development expenses of  in can primarily be attributed to personnel costs which increased or  consultant expenses which increased  and general overhead costs which increased  when compared to the increase in research and development expenses is primarily associated with new product development of the mas for windows and acuity financials product lines which were released and began shipping in in research and development expenses increased as the result of increases in personnel  consultant and general overhead costs 
personnel and consultant expense in increased or  as compared to and increases in general overhead costs including travel expenses accounted for the remaining increase 
increases in research and development costs in were primarily focused on new product development and product enhancements 
the company expects to increase research and development costs in future periods as a result of product development efforts for existing and future products related to new operating platforms and market segments 
however  as a result of the successful introduction of mas for windows and acuity financials a major milestone in the technology development effort has been achieved and expense in this area is expected to decrease 
development efforts in bringing additional products to market under the same technology base will be the concentration in  which will result in additional development expense 
the company does  however  expect the percentage of research and development costs when expressed as a percentage of revenues to decrease in general and administrative 
general and administrative costs in totaled  an increase of  or over general and administrative costs 
when expressed as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses in remained at of net revenues 
the increase in general and administrative expense can primarily be attributed to increased personnel and contract labor costs which increased  or over similar costs in general and administrative costs decreased from of revenues in to of revenues in the decrease of or  in general and administrative costs when compared to can primarily be attributed to decreased overhead costs as a result of a favorable lease renewal on the company s headquarters 
merger and acquisition costs 
the company incurred  of merger and acquisition costs in related to the merger of state of the art  inc and manzanita software systems 
these costs consisted primarily of investment banking fees  legal  accounting and certain personnel costs related to severance payments 
interest income 
interest income in increased  or over in interest income increased  or over in all three years interest income represented of company revenues 
the increase in interest income in both and was primarily the result of higher cash balances and short term investments which were generated from profitable operations 
in addition  interest earned on the company s cash balances was positively impacted by generally higher interest rates in than in income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate in was as compared to in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate in and was primarily the result of additional tax credits available to the company primarily associated with increased expenditures in qualified research and development expenses 
in the company had more qualified research and development expenses expressed as a percentage of net revenues than were incurred in  and in the company had more qualified research and development expenses than in see note to consolidated financial statements for further analysis and explanation on the company s income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations for the past eleven years through positive cash flow from operations 
on december  the company s working capital totaled  an increase of  or over working capital as of december  the company also has an unsecured line of credit in the amount of  with wells fargo bank that expires in april currently there is no outstanding balance on the line of credit 
the company believes that funds generated from operations  existing cash balances  short term investments and its bank line of credit will be sufficient to finance the company s operations for at least the next months
