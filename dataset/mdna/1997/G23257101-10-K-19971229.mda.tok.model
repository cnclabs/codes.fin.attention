item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following is an analysis of the company s results of operation  liquidity and capital resources 
to the extent that such analysis contains statements which are not of a historical nature  such statements are forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks include competing in a saturated industry against modern and larger fleets  the ability of the company to obtain additional financing for the acquisition of additional ships  a high percentage of debt on assets owned by the company  the potential for additional governmental regulations  the need for expensive upgrades and or maintenance to aging vessels  general economic factors in markets where the company operates  and other factors discussed in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
with respect to the company s cruise operations  the company earns revenues primarily from i the sale of passenger tickets  which include accommodations  meals  substantially all shipboard activities  and airfare and hotel packages  if applicable  and ii the sale of goods and services on board the cruise ships including  but not limited to  casino gambling enchanted isle only  liquor sales and concession income

with respect to sea comm s operations  the company earns revenue primarily from reimbursements from sea comm for all operating costs  food costs and all of the principal and interest due on the portion of the loan attributable to the universe explorer during the approximately days each year the vessel is used in the semester at sea and alaska programs 
as the majority owner of sea comm  the company includes all of sea comm s revenues and expenses in its consolidated financial statements and makes an appropriate entry to account for the minority interest of its partner 
because the semester at sea program is operated by seawise pursuant to a charter  the income and losses of the semester at sea program are substantially realized by seawise  not sea comm 
with respect to the alaska and caribbean wec programs  however  all income and losses are borne by sea comm 
the following table presents statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenues the company predecessor the company for the year ended and the company for the period september  pro forma ended september  september  revenues expenses operating selling and administrative depreciation and amortization loss on vessel fire total operating income loss other income expense net earnings loss before provision for preferred stock dividend the company has included the fiscal loss from the fire on the universe explorer as other income expense 
due to its new orleans point of embarkation  the company s revenues are more seasonal than other cruises with similar itineraries that depart from florida ports 
the greatest demand for the company s cruises occurs in june through august  and demand from february through may and november through december is also very good 
the company s slowest months are january  september and october 
the company s operations began on july   following the commodore closing 
for the two and one half months ended september   revenues from the operation of one cruise vessel were  including charter cancellation fees of  in january  the company placed its second vessel into service 
as a result  for the year ended september   revenues from the operation of two cruise vessels increased to  which included charter cancellation fees of  the company s fiscal year ends on september the pro forma fiscal year includes results of operations of the predecessor from october  until july   and those of the company for the balance of such fiscal year 
old commodore operated two vessels during the fiscal year 
old commodore operated the enchanted seas primarily on the new orleans itinerary during fiscal and placed this vessel in drydock just prior to the commodore closing 
concurrently therewith  old commodore placed the enchanted isle on the new orleans itinerary 
old commodore also operated the enchanted isle for days on a barbados itinerary during the fiscal year 
the company  however  operated only one vessel on the new orleans itinerary during its fiscal year 
however  old commodore operated up to five ships during the period since january  as a result  administration and marketing expenses were commingled and have been allocated to the predecessor based on the number of traffic days of all of old commodore s ships 
this may not be indicative of actual expenses which would have been incurred in connection with the operation of one ship by the company 
results of operations year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues increased by  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the number of ships operated each month by the company during these periods 
during fiscal  the company operated for approximately ship months as compared to approximately ship months for fiscal ship months are the aggregate number of months in which the company s ships operated during a fiscal year 
revenues also increased during fiscal due to the company s operation of the alaska program for a total of days during fiscal  which generated greater revenues than the summer semester at sea voyage days and alaska program days operated in fiscal despite this increase  the load factors for the alaska program declined from approximately in fiscal to approximately in fiscal finally  the company has experienced greater load factors during fiscal on its new orleans itinerary than in fiscal the increased loads yielded higher revenues 
the company s operating expenses increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was due to increased traffic and passenger days in fiscal  and lower load factors and relatively higher operating costs for the alaska and caribbean programs  which offers luxury cruise cuisine and luxury cabin services 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses represented of revenues in fiscal  as compared to of revenue in fiscal as a result of the prepaid drydock costs incurred in fiscal  the amortization of these costs resulted in higher operating costs of  in fiscal versus  in fiscal marketing  selling and administrative expenses increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the higher expenses were due to the company operating more wec alaska and caribbean cruises during fiscal than in fiscal which resulted in higher marketing costs for the company than it incurred when the semester at sea program operated its summer semester 
such increase was partially offset by lower marketing costs for the company s new orleans itinerary 
depreciation and amortization increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the additional capital expenditures incurred by the company in conjunction with meeting its solas requirements on the two vessels as well as a full year of depreciation on the universe explorer which was in operation for approximately months in fiscal versus months in fiscal interest expense  net  increased by  or from fiscal to fiscal due to the company s capitalization  in fiscal  of approximately months of interest incurred with respect to the universe explorer  which had not yet been placed in service 
seawise s interest in the company s sea comm joint venture is reflected in the  and  line item for minority interest share in loss earnings of consolidated joint venture for fiscal and respectively 
sea comm lost  during fiscal as compared to net earnings of  in fiscal this loss was due primarily to the decreased load factors during the wec programs operated by sea comm in fiscal as a result of losses sustained during the caribbean and alaska programs  seawise  through its minority interest  absorbs approximately of the company s loss on these programs 
in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
earnings per share  which changes the method for reporting earnings per share 
the statement is effective for financial statement periods ending after december  the company has not determined the impact  if any  of adopting the new standard 
year ended september   compared to pro forma year ended september  revenues increased by  or  for fiscal compared to proforma  primarily due to the number of ships operated each month by the company compared to the predecessor 
during fiscal  the company operated for approximately ship months as compared to approximately ship months for the predecessor during proforma ship months are the aggregate number of months in which the company s ships operated during a fiscal year 
revenues also increased during fiscal due to the company s operation of the semester at sea and alaska programs  which generated greater revenues than the predecessor s short lived barbados itinerary  which was deemed a failure 
finally  the company has experienced greater load factors during fiscal on its new orleans itinerary than did the predecessor in proforma the increased loads yielded higher revenues 
the company s operating expenses increased by  or  in fiscal compared to proforma this increase was due to increased revenues in fiscal  the termination of old commodore s barbados itinerary  which operated for only days in proforma  and the relatively lower operating costs for the semester at sea program  which does not offer luxury cruise cuisine or luxury cabin services 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses represented of revenues in fiscal  as compared to of revenue in proforma this decline of expenses as a percentage of revenue illustrates the relatively lower operating expenses of the semester at sea program as compared to luxury cruise service provided by the predecessor during proforma  as well as the increased cost of food and services that the predecessor incurred while operating the barbados itinerary  compared to the cost for similar products and services in new orleans 
marketing  selling and administrative expenses decreased by  or  in fiscal compared to proforma the higher expenses which the predecessor incurred in proforma related primarily to the termination of the barbados itinerary  the additional cost of airfare for cruise passengers to barbados  and the termination of old commodore s cruise operations in conjunction with the commodore acquisition 
depreciation and amortization decreased by  or  in fiscal compared to proforma  due to the difference in cost basis of the assets acquired by the company as compared to old commodore 
interest expense  net  decreased by  or from proforma to fiscal due to the company s capitalization of approximately months of interest incurred with respect to the universe explorer  which was not yet placed in service 
seawise s interest in the company s sea comm joint venture is reflected in the  line item for minority interest in earnings of consolidated joint venture 
the sea comm joint venture was formed in fiscal  consequently  no comparable line item exists for proforma liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital deficiency was  and  at september  and  respectively 
the company s working capital deficiency at september  and was primarily due to the inclusion  in non current assets  of a  deposit securing the company s fmc bond 
the corresponding liability  customer deposits  which was  and  at september  and respectively  is included in current liabilities 
the decrease in the company s working capital  in fiscal  was also due to the increase in the current portion of long term debt from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the company also received working capital from the proceeds of its public offering in and its private offering in cash flows from operations provided   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash flows for fiscal consisted primarily of decreases in restricted cash  due to a change in credit card processor  and collection of a large portion of the insurance claim receivable as well as increases in prepaid expenses  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
at september   the company owed  to the lender in connection with the commodore acquisition 
the loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of new commodore  including preferred ships mortgages on both cruise ships  and bears interest at libor plus 
in january the company and the lender amended the loan to provide for monthly payments of interest and principal for the duration of the loan 
in the event that the company is required to withhold income tax on any amounts due to the lender  the company has agreed to pay the required amount to be withheld and pay the lender the full amount of interest due under its agreements with the company 
the terms of the loan place certain restrictions on the company 
first  the company is not permitted to place any additional liens on any of its assets including the cruise ships without the prior consent of the lender 
second  the company is prohibited from paying more than of its net profits as dividends 
in addition to the foregoing  new commodore must maintain a minimum cash balance in its operating accounts of million 
on july   the universe explorer had a fire on board  which resulted in the death of five crew members and loss of revenues during the day period the ship was out of service 
the majority of the losses by the passengers and crew  damage to the hull and machinery of the vessel and loss of hire is covered by the company s insurance policies  subject to applicable deductibles 
as a result  as of september  and the company had an insurance receivable balance of  and  respectively 
the company expects to collect the balance of the receivable in fiscal the universe explorer was in drydock in the third quarter of fiscal to effect the necessary repairs and modifications to comply with the solas requirements for the vessel 
the enchanted isle was sent to drydock  for similar modifications  during the beginning of fiscal the company will carry out additional work to the universe explorer in january  estimated to cost approximately  in order to have that vessel in full compliance with us coast guard interpretations of the solas requirements as well 
during fiscal  the company plans to make certain capital improvements to each of the cruise ships 
these improvements  some of which have already been completed  are expected to cost approximately million 
the company had accrued approximately  at september  toward such improvements 
the company intends to fund these costs from cash from operations 
during fiscal  the company will also continue to explore the possible acquisition of additional vessels 
in this regard  in november  the company commenced a private offering the private offering of up to million in principal amount of convertible debentures the debentures 
the company is offering the debentures for sale on a best efforts basis directly and through certain selected broker dealers at a purchase price equal to of the face value of such debentures 
the debentures are convertible into shares of common stock of the company at the option of the holder thereof based on the average closing sale price of the common stock for the five trading days immediately prior to conversion  but in no event less than or more than per share 
the debentures are also convertible at the option of the company  provided the common stock trades above a certain price for a specified period 
the company has agreed to register the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures  under the securities act of  as amended the securities act 
as of december   the company had closed on subscriptions for  in debentures  which generated approximately  in proceeds to the company after deducting brokerage commissions and expenses of the private offering 
the debentures being offered will not be or have not been registered under the securities act and are being offered pursuant to the exemption from registration afforded by regulation d under the securities act 
the company plans to apply the proceeds from the private offering towards the purchase of additional vessels and for general working capital purposes 
the company is currently in preliminary negotiations regarding the purchase of several different vessels and has not yet reached an agreement in principle regarding the purchase of any specific vessel 
in the event the company reaches such an agreement  it anticipates that such purchase will require additional debt or equity financing  which the company will attempt to procure at such time 
the company s net income is largely exempt from united states income taxes pursuant to the terms of a certain international shipping exemption 
such exemption requires  among other things  that of the value of the company s capital stock be traded on certain securities exchanges or markets 
at present  the company believes that it meets the requirements of such exemption because its common stock is traded on the nnm 
whether the company meets the requirement  however  also depends on the value of the company s common stock compared to the value of the series a preference shares  which are not traded on nnm and cannot be included in the determination 
in the event the value of the common stock should decline  the company could become ineligible for the international shipping exemption  which would cause its income to be subject to united states income taxes 
such an event would have a material adverse effect on the company 
as part of the private offering  the company has agreed to register the common stock into which the debentures are convertible 
as a result  the company believes that many of the holders of the debentures will convert their debentures into common stock 
such additional issuances of common stock should assist the company in continuing to meet the requirements of the international shipping exemption 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operations has not been significant to date 
there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on the company s operations
