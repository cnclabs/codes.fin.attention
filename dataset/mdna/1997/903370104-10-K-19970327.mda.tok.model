funds from operations takes into consideration the accrual of revenue and expenses  which more appropriately reflects operating performance 
net cash provided by operating activities represents cash receipts and disbursements without regard to when income was earned or expense incurred

inflation low to moderate levels of inflation during the past few years have favorably impacted the company s operation by stabilizing operating expenses 
at the same time  low inflation has the indirect effect of reducing the company s ability to increase tenant rents 
the trust s properties have tenants whose leases include expense reimbursements and other provisions to minimize the effect of inflation 
these factors  in the long run  are expected to result in more attractive returns from the trust s real estate portfolio as compared to short term investment vehicles
