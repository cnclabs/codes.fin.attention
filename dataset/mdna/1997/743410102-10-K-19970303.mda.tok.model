item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with sci s financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this report 
the statements contained in this discussion and elsewhere in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which sci operates  management s beliefs and assumptions made by management 
words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions future factors which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
sci undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
future factors include i changes in general economic conditions in its target markets that could adversely affect demand for sci s properties and the creditworthiness of sci s customers  ii changes in financial markets and interest rates that could adversely affect sci s cost of capital and its ability to meet its financing needs and obligations  and iii those factors discussed below 
these are representative of the future factors that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements 
overview sci s operating results depend primarily upon net operating income from distribution properties  which is substantially influenced by i the demand for and supply of distribution properties in sci s target market cities  ii the pace and economic returns at which sci can acquire and develop additional distribution properties  and iii the extent to which sci can sustain improved market performance as measured by lease rates and occupancy 
sci s target market cities and submarkets have benefitted substantially in recent periods from demographic trends including population and job growth which influence the demand for distribution properties 
sci believes its ability to compete is significantly enhanced relative to other companies because of the reit manager s depth of management  including the sci national operating system tm  which includes acquisition and development personnel  and presence in local markets 
the reit manager is a subsidiary of security capital group  sci s largest shareholder 
as a result of acquisitions and developments  sci s rentable square footage increased by million square feet or to million square feet as of december  from million square feet as of december  as of december   the portfolio was leased 
sci expects that its ability to acquire and develop distribution properties at favorable economic returns will continue through over the longer term  sci expects master planned  full service distribution park developments to constitute an increasing percentage of sci s growth 
additionally  sci development services incorporated sci development services see results of operations other real estate income is expected to contribute recurring income in subsequent periods 
as of december   million square feet of sci s million square feet under development consisted of build to suits representing a total expected investment of million 
sci frequently acquires properties which are underleased and develops properties which are not fully leased at the start of construction  which reduces sci s overall occupancy rate below its stabilized level but provides opportunities to increase revenues 
the term stabilized means that capital improvements  repositioning  new management and new marketing programs or development and marketing  in the case of newly developed properties have been completed and in effect for a sufficient period of time but in no case longer than months for properties acquired by sci and months after shell completion for properties developed by sci to achieve stabilized occupancy typically  but ranging from to  depending on the submarket and product type at market rents 
sci has been successful in increasing occupancies on acquired and developed properties during their initial months of operations resulting in an occupancy rate of for stabilized properties owned as of december  the average increase in rental rates for new and renewed leases on previously leased space during was 
as leases are renewed or new leases are acquired  sci expects most lease rates on renewals or new leases to increase in these factors should improve sci s results of operations 
capital and credit market conditions which affect sci s cost of equity and debt capital may influence future growth in operating results 
no assurance can be given that expected trends for in leasing rates  occupancy rates and economic returns on acquired and developed properties will be realized 
there are risks associated with sci s development and acquisition activities which include development and acquisition opportunities explored by sci may be abandoned  construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other expenses  and construction and lease up may not be completed on schedule  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs 
acquisition activities entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations and that analysis with respect to the cost of improvements to bring an acquired project up to standards will prove inaccurate  as well as general investment risks associated with any new real estate investment 
although sci undertakes a thorough evaluation of the physical condition of each new project before it is acquired  certain defects or necessary repairs may not be detected until after the project is acquired  which could increase sci s total acquisition cost 
the occurrence of any of the events described above could adversely affect sci s ability to achieve its projected returns on acquisitions and projects under development and could hinder sci s ability to make expected distributions 
results of operations compared to net earnings attributable to common shares increased by million or to million in from million in the increase in net earnings is principally due to increased distribution properties in operation  resulting from and acquisition and development activity 
net earnings are expected to increase in subsequent periods due to the acquisition and development of additional operating properties and the continued increase in the stabilized portfolio rental rates and the pre stabilized portfolio rental rates and occupancy 
historically  the primary components of revenue and earnings growth have been sci s acquisition and development activity 
sci has acquired and developed operating properties totalling million square feet from its inception through december  at a historical cost of billion 
projected property level earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for these properties is of sci s aggregate cost 
aggregate cost for the properties includes the purchase price  closing costs and budgeted capital improvements and marketing costs prior to stabilization and all development costs  in the case of developed properties 
projected ebitda is based on current lease rates for stabilized properties and current market rates for properties being stabilized and anticipated operating expenses 
ebitda does not represent and should not be substituted for net earnings as defined by gaap and is not indicative of cash flows from operations or that cash flows are sufficient to fund all cash needs 
no assurance can be given that projected levels of ebitda will be achieved by these properties nor that future acquisitions and developments will achieve the same level of ebitda relative to sci s investment basis 
the ebitda measure presented by sci may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
rental revenues rental revenues for increased by million or to million  as compared to million for of this increase  million was generated by the properties acquired in  million was generated by the developments completed in  million was generated by the properties acquired in  and million was generated by the developments completed in the remaining million increase was attributable to revenue increases in the properties owned at january  the revenue increase in properties owned at january  was due to an increase in their average occupancy level from for to for and increased rental rates on leases signed on previously occupied space 
other real estate income other real estate income consists primarily of gains on disposition of undepreciated property and fees and other income from build to suit customers generated to a large extent by sci development services 
sci development services develops build to suit distribution space facilities or works on a fee basis for customers whose space needs do not meet sci s strict investment criteria for long term ownership

such notes are governed by the terms and provisions of an indenture agreement the indenture between sci and state street bank and trust company  as trustee 
under the terms of the indenture  sci can incur additional debt only if  after giving effect to the debt being incurred and application of proceeds therefrom  i the ratio of debt to total assets  as defined in the indenture  does not exceed  ii the ratio of secured debt to total assets  as defined in the indenture  does not exceed and iii sci s pro forma interest coverage ratio  as defined in the indenture  for the four preceding fiscal quarters is not less than in addition  sci may not at any time own total unencumbered assets  as defined in the indenture  equal to less than of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of sci s unsecured debt 
as of december   sci was in compliance with all such debt covenants 
sci has a line of credit agented by nationsbank in the amount of million 
the line of credit  as amended and restated effective may   bears interest at sci s option at either a the greater of the federal funds rate plus and prime or b libor plus  based upon sci s current senior debt rating  and is scheduled to mature in may this line may be extended annually for an additional year with the approval of nationsbank and the bank group 
if the bank group elects not to extend the line of credit  at sci s election  the facility will either a convert to a three year term note  or b continue on a revolving basis with the remaining one year maturity 
all debt incurrences are subject to a covenant that sci maintain a debt to tangible net worth ratio of not greater than to additionally  sci is required to maintain an adjusted net worth as defined of at least billion  to maintain interest payment coverage of not less than to  and to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined of not less than to as of december   sci was in compliance with these debt covenants 
as of february  no borrowings were outstanding on sci s line of credit 
from inception through december   sci had invested billion for the acquisition and development of operating distribution properties 
these acquisitions and developments were financed with cash on hand  the issuance of limited partnership units  the assumption of existing mortgage debt and borrowings under sci s line of credit which were repaid with the proceeds of sci s equity and debt offerings 
at december   sci had million of budgeted development cost for developments in process  of which million was unfunded 
sci expects to finance construction  development and acquisitions primarily with cash on hand  borrowings under its line of credit and cash from future securities offerings 
when issuing debt  sci intends primarily to arrange fully amortizing  fixed rate  year to year debt to finance additional acquisitions and developments 
to a lesser extent  under certain circumstances  sci may arrange for debt with different maturities in order to optimize its debt maturity schedule 
sci utilizes derivative instruments in anticipation of future financing transactions in order to manage well defined interest rate risk 
through hedging  sci can effectively manage the risk of increases in interest rates on future debt issuances 
in anticipation of debt offerings in  on november   sci entered into a forward treasury lock agreement on million of us treasuries maturing august  at a base price of 
this contract terminates on july  and effectively fixes the thirty year treasury bond at a rate of 
sci also entered into a swap agreement the transaction on november  which becomes effective on july   has a notional principal amount of million  and requires sci  as the counterparty  to pay a fixed rate of on the notional amount in exchange for a floating rate equal to the three month libor rate for a ten year term 
at the option of sci  the transaction can be early terminated from and including the effective date of july  if sci does not exercise its option to early terminate the agreement as of january   the transaction will early terminate  cancel  and cash settle on that date 
as of february   the fair value of these open contracts totaled million 
sci considers its liquidity and ability to generate cash from operations and financings to be adequate and expects it to continue to be adequate to meet sci s acquisition  development  operating  debt service and shareholder distribution requirements 
sci s current distribution policy is to pay quarterly distributions to shareholders based upon what the board and the reit manager consider to be a reasonable percentage of cash flow 
because depreciation is a non cash expense  cash flow typically will be greater than earnings from operations and net earnings 
therefore  quarterly distributions will consistently be higher than quarterly earnings 
pursuant to the terms of the series a preferred shares  the series b preferred shares and the series c preferred shares the preferred shares  sci is restricted from declaring or paying any distribution with respect to the common shares unless all cumulative distributions with respect to the preferred shares have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for distributions that have been declared for the then current distribution period with respect to the preferred shares 
the preferred share dividends do not reduce the amount sci has budgeted for common share distributions  but do increase the percentage of the common share distribution that constitutes a non taxable return of capital 
net cash flow provided by operating activities was million for  compared to million for  and million for the primary differences between the periods relate to new property acquisitions and development completions as described under results of operations above 
sci s investment activities used approximately million  million and million of cash in  and  respectively 
after deducting distributions to shareholders  sci s financing activities provided net cash flow of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
funds from operations funds from operations attributable to common shares increased million or to million in from million in sci believes that funds from operations is helpful in understanding a property portfolio in that such calculation reflects cash flow from operating activities and the properties ability to support interest payments and general operating expenses before the impact of certain activities  such as changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or any other gaap measurement of performance  as an indicator of sci s operating performance  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
the funds from operations measure presented by sci may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reits 
funds from operations represents sci s net earnings computed in accordance with gaap before minority interest and before gains losses on disposition of depreciated property  plus depreciation and amortization 
in january  sci changed to a more conservative policy of expensing loan cost amortization in determining funds from operations 
for comparability  funds from operations has been restated to give effect to this policy as if it had been in effect in prior years 
statement of funds from operations years ended december   and in thousands unaudited net earnings attributable to common shares    add deduct depreciation and amortization    minority interest    gain loss on disposition of depreciated real estate  other funds from operations attributable to common shares 
   reit management agreement effective december   sci entered into an agreement as amended and restated  the reit management agreement pursuant to which the reit manager assumed the day to day management of sci 
on january   sci announced that it had received a proposal from security capital group  sci s largest shareholder and owner of the reit manager and client services  to exchange the reit manager and client services for common shares 
as a result of the transaction  sci would become an internally managed reit  and security capital group would remain sci s largest shareholder 
the board has formed a special committee comprised of independent trustees to review the proposed transaction 
the transaction is subject to approval by the special committee and the full board 
if the board approves the transaction  a proxy statement  subject to review by the securities and exchange commission  will be mailed to sci shareholders prior to a shareholder vote on the proposed transaction 
see item business security capital industrial trust 
the reit management agreement requires sci to pay a base annual fee of approximately of cash flow as defined in the reit management agreement 
see item business the reit manager for a description of the services included in the reit management fee 
cash flow is calculated by reference to sci s cash flow from operations  plus i fees paid to the reit manager  ii extraordinary expenses incurred at the request of the independent trustees of sci and iii of any interest paid by sci on convertible subordinated debentures of which there are currently none  and  after deducting actual or imputed regularly scheduled principal and interest payments for long term debt and distributions actually paid with respect to non convertible preferred shares of beneficial interest  such as the series a preferred shares and series c preferred shares 
the reit management agreement provides that the notes described above under liquidity and capital resources will be treated as having regularly scheduled principal and interest payments like a year level monthly payment  fully amortizing mortgage  and the imputed principal and interest payments are deducted from cash flow in determining the fee 
the reit management fee calculation includes a portion of the interest on convertible debt because of the equity characteristics represented by the conversion feature of such debt 
sci does not currently plan to issue any convertible debt 
cash flow does not include interest and dividend income from sci development services  realized gains from dispositions of investments or income from cash equivalent investments 
the reit manager also receives a fee of per year on the average daily balance of cash equivalent investments 
total real estate operating  general and administrative costs will increase due to sci s larger asset size following each security offering  as well as unforeseen changes which may occur 
reit management fees paid by sci will increase if cash flow of sci  as defined in the reit management agreement  increases  including such increases that may relate to increases in sci s assets 
sci does not expect its other operating costs and expenses to increase except as a result of inflation  market conditions or other factors over which the reit manager has no control 
operating costs for particular items  however  may be increased if they are expected to result in greater decreases in other expenses or increases in revenues from sci assets 
for example  land holding costs and pursuit cost write offs fluctuate in relation to sci s acquisition and development activity 
sci is obligated to reimburse the reit manager for all expenses incurred by the reit manager on behalf of sci relating to sci s operations  primarily including third party legal  accounting  property development and similar fees paid on behalf of sci  and travel expenses incurred in seeking financing  property acquisitions  property development  property sales  attending sci board and shareholder meetings and similar activities on behalf of sci 
under the reit management agreement  the reit manager or any of its affiliates are not precluded from rendering services to other investors  including other reits  even if such investors compete with sci 
since the reit manager is a wholly owned subsidiary of sci s largest shareholder  the reit manager has no intention of rendering services to investors who compete with sci 
the reit management agreement is renewable by sci annually  subject to a determination by the independent trustees that the reit manager s performance has been satisfactory and that the compensation payable to the reit manager is fair 
each of sci and the reit manager may terminate the reit management agreement on days notice 
because of the year to year nature of the agreement  its maximum effect on sci s results of operations cannot be predicted  other than that reit management fees will generally increase or decrease in proportion to cash flow increases or decreases 
to better serve national companies and enable sci to exclusively meet all of their distribution space needs  sci development services develops build to suit distribution space facilities or works on a fee basis for customers whose space needs do not meet sci s strict investment criteria for long term ownership 
through its preferred stock ownership  sci will realize substantially all economic benefits of sci development services activities 
under a separate agreement  the reit manager provides sci development services with day to day management for a fee based on of sci development services pre tax cash flow  including gains and losses realized on property sales 
the fee incurred by sci development services for was approximately million  which is included in sci s consolidated reit management fee expense of million 
dividends and interest paid by sci development services to sci are excluded from sci s cash flow for determining the reit management fee paid by sci
