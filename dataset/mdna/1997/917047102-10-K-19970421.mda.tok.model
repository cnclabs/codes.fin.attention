item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s historical results of operations and of its liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements of the company and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
general the company is composed of two retail subsidiaries  urban retail and anthropologie  and a wholesale subsidiary 
urban retail is the largest of the three  has the highest gross profit margins and generates most of the company s revenues and profits 
urban retail had stores opened at january  and at january  the company s first anthropologie store opened in october two anthropologie stores were added in fiscal due to protracted lease negotiations  no new stores were opened in fiscal  while five anthropologie stores were opened in fiscal negotiations for additional leases continue 
the wholesale company s growth is from both the domestic and international markets 
fiscal and continued as very profitable years for urban outfitters with earnings to net sales of and  respectively  as well as return on shareholders equity of and  respectively 
the slight contraction of earning to net sales in fiscal and the direction of return on shareholders equity in that year resulted primarily from a slowdown in retail sales growth in both fiscal and a combination of lower comparable store sales growth in the two years and planned new stores either not opened fiscal or opened late fiscal caused the slowdown in sales growth 
the wholesale company has  by contrast  continued to record exceptional sales growth throughout the two fiscal years 
the company s fiscal year ends on january all references in this discussion to fiscal years of the company refer to the fiscal years ended on january in those years 
for example  the company s fiscal year is its fiscal year ended january  the comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion are calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented 
results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of the company s net sales represented by certain income statement data and the growth of certain of such income statement data from period to period 
fiscal year ended january  as a percentage of net sales net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations net interest and other expenses income 


income before income taxes income tax expense net income period over period dollar growth net sales gross profit income from operations net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal increased to million from million in the prior fiscal year  a increase 
the million increase was attributable to comparable store net sales increases of million  net sales of million from stores opened or enlarged during fiscal and fiscal and net sales increases of million from the wholesale company 
the comparable store sales increase of or million in fiscal over results from the inverse relationship of higher average selling prices and fewer pieces sold 
the higher average selling prices representing approximately million and the fewer pieces sold approximately million leaving the million in comparable store sales 
new and enlarged stores included four stores opened in fiscal and seven opened in fiscal the company believes increased net sales from the wholesale subsidiary during fiscal were attributable to increased orders and order size due to the popularity of its product lines as well as growth in number of orders and size of orders from international customers 
the company s gross profit margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the primary contributors to the decline were higher markdowns in the retail companies  high growth of a new  lower margin product line in the wholesale company  and a mix swing to higher sales in the lower gross profit margin companies anthropologie and wholesale 
markdowns were triggered by lower than plan comparable store sales and by late openings of two urban retail stores 
the new wholesale product line did not have production economies of scale enjoyed by its larger and more established product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses grew to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year  a increase 
as a percentage of net sales  the expenses increased to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in percentage was attributable to urban retail due to lower comparable store sales 
conversely  both anthropologie and wholesale experienced selling  general and administrative expense leveraging on significant sales growth 
net income increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year  a increase 
this increase was principally achieved through increases in net sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal increased to million from million in the prior fiscal year  a increase 
the million increase was attributable to comparable store net sales increases of million  net sales of million from stores opened or enlarged during fiscal and fiscal and net sales increases of million from wholesale 
the comparable store sales increase of over fiscal levels was created by an inverse relationship between a decline in the average selling price and a greater increase in the pieces sold 
the average selling price decline of was a combination of lower initial selling prices from a mix of lower priced merchandise not lower markups and higher markdowns in fiscal when compared to fiscal pieces sold  on the other hand  increased by 
the increases from new and enlarged store sales growth in fiscal were attributed to three urban retail stores and two anthropologie stores opened in the second half of fiscal and four urban retail stores opened in fiscal the company believes increased net sales from the wholesale subsidiary during fiscal were attributable to increased orders and order size due to the popularity of its product lines 
the company s gross profit margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the primary contributors to the decline were higher markdowns across all three companies in fiscal contrary to the markdown trend  initial markups were higher in each company than in the prior year 
anthropologie stores opened prior to the beginning of fiscal sold well against their sales plan  but had bought inventory for expected store openings that did not take place in fiscal this added to the markdowns 
anthropologie sales grew at a faster rate than urban retail but  at the same time  had a lower gross profit margin thus contributing to the overall decline 
freight rates on a growing group of west coast and southwest stores contributed slightly 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year  a increase 
as a percentage of net sales  the expenses decreased to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
all three companies contributed to the decrease 
the companies were subject to expense control programs initiated when it became apparent  early in the year  that sales were not going to meet planned levels during the first half 
the year to year aggregate dollar increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was almost entirely attributable to rent and other costs of operating new stores 
net income increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year  a increase 
this increase was principally achieved through increases in net sales  a small percentage reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses  higher net interest income and lower nonoperating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources during the last three years the company has satisfied its cash requirements through cash flow from operations 
the company s primary uses of cash have been to open new stores  build a new distribution center and purchase inventories 
in addition to cash generated from operations  sources of cash have included the net proceeds from the exercise of certain warrants and employee stock options in each of fiscal  and over the next few years  the company expects to incur capital expenditures in support of its expansion program 
accumulated cash and future cash from operations are expected to fund such expansion related uses of cash 
although the company has not borrowed short term or long term funds during the last five fiscal years  it maintains a line of credit of million  of which all is available for cash borrowings or for the issuance of letters of credit 
the line is unsecured and any cash borrowings under the line would accrue interest at the libor rate plus of one percent 
the company uses letters of credit primarily to purchase private label and wholesale merchandise from offshore suppliers 
outstanding balances of letters of credit at january  and were million and million  respectively 
there were no short term or long term debts outstanding at january  or at january the company expects that accumulated cash and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s cash needs for at least the next three years 
seasonality and quarterly results while urban outfitters has been profitable in each of its last operating quarters  its operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
the company s highest sales levels have historically occurred during the five month period from august to december of each year the back to school and holiday periods 
sales generated during these periods have traditionally had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
any decreases in sales for these periods or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding these periods could have a material  adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s results of operations in any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that can be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
the company s results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of expenses incurred in connection with  and sales contributed by  new stores  store expansions and the integration of new stores into the operations of the company  as well as other factors 
the addition of a large number of new stores can therefore significantly affect results of operations on a quarter to quarter basis
