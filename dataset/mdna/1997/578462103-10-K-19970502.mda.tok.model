during fiscal  approximately of the company s net sales were to sam s customers 
results of operations for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal reflect the company s strategy to achieve expense savings at all levels 
during this time the company also implemented merchandise strategies and selection offerings that further allowed the company to achieve higher gross margins in its leased departments 
in addition  emphasis on cash management and inventory control systems allowed the company to generate positive cash flows from operations and reduce its reliance on working capital support from third party lenders 
finally  the company s ongoing drive to reduce and better balance its inventory levels led the company to improve its inventory turns and reduce its average inventory requirements 
management believes there is the possibility of additional opportunity for continued improvements in gross margins  operating cash flows and expense savings in its traditional core business with sam s club 
however  these opportunities are not believed to be as significant as those realized in fiscal and fiscal on november   the company opened its first jewelry depot  a  square foot value oriented jewelry and luxury gift store in framingham  massachusetts 
subsequently  the company also opened two jewelry depot outlets  a  square foot facility in vero beach  florida and an square foot store in worcester  massachusetts

accordingly  the remaining balance of goodwill of million as of january   was written off in fiscal in the fourth quarter of  the company made the decision to sell certain inventory at significantly less than normal prices  resulting in an estimated net realizable value below the cost of such inventory 
this decision was made a to liquidate the merchandise that was predominantly sold in the wholesale watch division which was being closed in order to focus management s attention on the company s retail operations  and b to liquidate certain other inventory on an expedited basis in order to raise cash for liquidity purposes as a result of the then uncertain status of credit availability due to the company s failure to comply with certain covenants in its debt agreements

upon closing of this amendment  the company prepaid the million remaining balance of the senior notes 
the company s working capital requirements are directly related to the amount of inventory required to support its retail operations 
the company began fiscal with retail inventory in excess of its needs  primarily due to the inventory purchased under the sam s club agreement as previously discussed 
over the course of that year  inventory was reduced providing the liquidity to fund its repurchase obligations to sam s and the company s operating losses 
the agreement related to the amended working capital facility contains covenants which require the company to maintain financial ratios related to earnings  working capital  inventory turnover  trade payables and tangible net worth 
it limits capital expenditures and the incurrence of additional debt and prohibits payment of dividends 
there can be no assurance that the company s future operating results will be sufficient to meet the requirements of the foregoing covenants 
during fiscal  operations provided million in cash primarily due to the effects of depreciation and amortization and the significant reduction in inventory  partially offset by reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the inventory reduction in fiscal is primarily a result of management s efforts to decrease its reliance on working capital support from third party lenders 
capital expenditures for fiscal were million  primarily for new back office computer systems 
cash of million was used to prepay the remaining balance of the senior notes 
the company s business is highly seasonal  with seasonal working capital needs peaking in october and november  before the holiday shopping season 
the company anticipates similar seasonal needs in fiscal the company partially finances its peak seasonal inventory with short term borrowings 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company s peak levels of inventory were million  million and million and peak outstanding short term borrowings pursuant to lines of credit were million  million and million  respectively 
average amounts of outstanding short term borrowings for the respective years were  million and million 
during fiscal  a dispute arose between sam s and the company related to certain wholesale sales and returns  primarily relating to claims by sam s for credits for certain merchandise returns 
the company considers this matter to be in nature and magnitude outside the normal course of business 
the total difference between the amount of credits that sam s has claimed and the amount the company believes is appropriate is approximately million 
the company and sam s have held discussions and negotiations regarding this matter  however  no resolution has been reached 
while the company believes that no further amounts are owed to sam s  the outcome remains uncertain 
the financial statements do not include a provision for any loss that may result from the resolution of this matter 
the company believes that its cash on hand  projected cash from operations and availability under the working capital facility will be sufficient to meet its anticipated working capital and capital expenditure needs for fiscal there can be no assurance that the company s future operating results will be sufficient to sustain working capital and capital expenditure needs 
effects of inflation gold prices are affected by political  industrial and economic factors and by changing perceptions of the value of gold relative to currencies 
investors commonly purchase gold and other precious metals perceived to be rising in value as a hedge against a perceived increase in inflation  thereby bidding up the price of such metals 
the company s sales volume and net income are potentially affected by the fluctuations in prices of gold  diamonds and other precious or semi precious gemstones as well as watches and other accessories 
the company has used gold commodities futures contracts to hedge its gold inventories  excluding the gold component of gem jewelry related merchandise 
because of the change in the company s business and the manner in which it procures and sells gold jewelry as further discussed in note d to the consolidated financial statements  the company believes that it is no longer necessary to hedge its gold inventories 
therefore  during the fifty two weeks ended february   the company discontinued its hedging activities relating to gold inventories 
hedging is not available with respect to possible fluctuations in the price of precious and semi precious gemstones  watches or other accessories 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses are directly affected by inflation resulting in an increased cost of doing business 
although inflation has not had and the company does not expect it to have a material effect on operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
new accounting pronouncements the company adopted the following statements of financial accounting standards sfas in the year ending february   which did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles  and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used and for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by a company are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
measurement of an impairment loss for such long lived assets and identifiable intangibles should be based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of are required to be reported generally at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans  including stock options  stock purchase plans  restricted stock  and stock appreciation rights 
sfas no 
defines and encourages the use of the fair value method of accounting for employee stock based compensation 
continuing use of the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb for measurement of employee stock based compensation is allowed with pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method of accounting had been applied 
transactions in which equity instruments are issued in exchange for goods or services from non employees must be accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or of the equity instrument issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
the company has determined that it will continue to use the method of accounting prescribed in apb for measurement of employee stock based compensation  and has provided the required pro forma disclosures in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
future operating results  uncertainties and risks the future operating results of the company may be affected by a number of factors  including without limitation the following the company is focusing on strategic business development and the company incurred expenses for the initial phase of the project of approximately  a significant portion of those costs were expensed by the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company is currently unable to determine to what extent the strategies will be implemented or the impact of any potential growth opportunities on its future operating results or capital requirements 
the company markets its products through sam s club  a division of wal mart  inc  pursuant to an arrangement whereby the company operates an exclusive leased department at all of sam s existing and future domestic and puerto rican locations through february  accordingly  the company is dependent on sam s to conduct its business  and the loss of the leased department arrangement with sam s would have a material adverse effect on the business of the company 
during fiscal  the company will continue to focus on developing retail opportunities outside its traditional core business within sam s club 
whether by acquisition or by developing alternative retail concepts  management believes that the company should be in a diversified position if it is to successfully renegotiate or absorb the expiration of its sam s club lease in the pursuit of any such opportunity will require a significant investment of capital and attention by management 
such business development is subject to all risks inherent to establishing or acquiring an additional business  including competition and consumer uncertainties 
on november   the company opened its first jewelry depot  a  square foot value oriented jewelry and luxury gift store in framingham  massachusetts 
subsequently  the company also opened two jewelry depot outlet locations  a  square foot facility in vero beach  florida and an square foot store in worcester  massachusetts 
the jewelry depot and jewelry depot outlet each were opened as prototypes for potential stand alone jewelry operations that the company has evaluated as possible long term sources of additional revenue 
the framingham and worcester locations have not been successful and in january the company decided it would close these operations 
additionally  during the third quarter of  the company acquired from andin international  inc its three manhattan diamond locations in the potomac mills  gurnee mills and orlando belz outlet malls 
the company currently is unable to determine the impact of these three stand alone jewelry operations on its future operating results or capital requirements 
the company s retail operation requires expertise in the areas of merchandising  sourcing  selling  personnel  training  systems and accounting 
the company must look to increases in the number of retail locations to occur  thereby increasing the company s customer base  for expansion 
the retail jewelry market is particularly subject to the level of consumer discretionary income and the subsequent impact on the type and value of goods purchased 
with the consolidation of the retail industry  the company believes that competition both within the warehouse club industry and with other competing general and specialty retailers and discounters will continue to increase 
further consolidation of the warehouse club industry due to geographic constraints and market consolidation might also adversely affect the company s existing relationship with sam s and the company s business 
the opening and success of the leased locations and locations to be opened in later years  if any  will depend on various factors  including general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending  the performance of the company s retail programs and concepts  and the ability of the company to manage the leased operations and future expansion and hire and train personnel 
the company purchases diamonds and other gemstones directly in international markets located in tel aviv  new york  antwerp and elsewhere 
the company seeks to meet its diamond requirements with purchases on a systemic basis throughout the year 
hedging is not available with respect to possible fluctuations in the price of gemstones 
if such fluctuations should be unusually large or rapid and result in prolonged higher or lower prices  there is no assurance that the necessary price adjustments could be made quickly enough to prevent the company from being adversely affected 
further  the continued availability of diamonds to the company is dependent  to some degree  upon the political and economic situation in south africa and russia  which have been unstable 
several other countries also are major suppliers of diamonds  including botswana and zaire 
in the event of an interruption of diamond supplies  or a material or prolonged reduction in the world supply of finished diamonds  the company could be adversely affected 
although purchases of several critical raw materials  notably gold and gemstones  are made from a limited number of sources  the company believes that there are numerous alternative sources for all raw materials used in the manufacture of its finished jewelry  and the failure of any principal supplier would not have a material adverse effect on operations 
any changes in foreign or domestic laws and policies affecting international trade may have a material adverse effect on the availability or price on the diamonds  other gemstones  precious metals and non jewelry products purchased by the company 
because supplies of parallel marketed products are not always readily available  it can be a difficult process to match the customer demand to market availability 
the company utilizes the services of independent suppliers and customs agents to comply with us customs laws in connection with its purchases of gold  diamond and other jewelry merchandise from domestic and foreign sources 
the company bears certain risks in purchasing parallel marketed goods which includes certain watches and other products such as fragrances and collectibles 
parallel marketed goods are products to which trademarks are legitimately applied but which were not necessarily intended by their foreign manufacturers to be imported and sold in the united states 
the laws and regulations governing transactions involving such goods lack clarity in significant respects 
from time to time  trademark or copyright holders and their licensees initiate private suits or administrative agency proceedings seeking damages or injunctive relief based on alleged trademark or copyright infringement by purchasers and sellers of parallel marketed goods 
while the company believes that its practices and procedures with respect to the purchase of parallel marketed goods lessen the risk of significant litigation or liability  the company is from time to time involved in such proceedings and there can be no assurance that additional claims or suits will not be initiated against the company or any of its affiliates  and there can be no assurances regarding the results of any pending or future claims or suits 
further  legislation has been introduced in congress in recent years and is currently pending regarding parallel marketed goods 
certain legislative or regulatory proposals  if enacted  could materially limit the company s ability to sell parallel marketed goods in the united states 
there can be no assurances as to whether or when any such proposals might be acted upon by congress or that future judicial  legislative or administrative agency action will restrict or eliminate these sources of supply 
the company has identified alternate sources of supply or categories of similar products  although the cost of certain products may increase or their availability may be lessened 
the agreements related to the company s amended working capital facility contain covenants which require the company to maintain financial ratios related to earnings  working capital  inventory turnover  trade payables and tangible net worth 
it also limits capital expenditures and the incurrence of additional debt and prohibits the payment of dividends 
there can be assurance that the company s future operating results will be sufficient to meet the requirements of the foregoing covenants
