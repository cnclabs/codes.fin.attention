the current consolidation trend amongst these retailers poses additional opportunities  as well as challenges in the future 
the company believes that  based on its relationships with its retail customers  it is well positioned to participate in the industry s future growth

cost and expenses 
cost of sales for the year ended july  was million  an increase of million  or over million for the year ended july  cost of sales increased as a percentage of net sales 
the increase in cost of sales was limited as a result of the improvement in the overall sales mix towards higher margin products such as the company s fields of nature brand and the new herbal product line  coupled with lower acquisition costs of certain raw materials attributable in part to the increased purchasing power of the company as a result of the merger with hall in april in addition  certain of the company s new product introductions  such as glucosamine and st 
john s wort  entail higher gross profit margins than the company s overall profit margins 
the above factors were offset by the lower sales levels experienced by the revlon line of licensed products which had significantly higher margins than the company s overall profit margins  coupled with the changes recorded in the fourth quarter relative to the discontinuation of the revlon line 
in addition  the higher level of sales contributed by the intergel division  which entailed lower profit margins than the company s core business segments  also contributed to the increase in overall cost of sales during the company is presently negotiating an agreement with the union representing intergel s production and maintenance employees 
it is not known what effect  if any  this agreement will have on intergel s future cost of operations 
in addition  the cost of sales was impacted by the increased amortization expense attributable to the increased costs associated with securing longer term customer supply agreements 
these agreements  for the most part  extend over two or three year periods  and the related costs are amortized over the expected lives of the agreements 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended july  were million  an increase of million or over million for the year ended july  this increase was primarily attributable to i increased advertising and promotional activities  ii increases in sales commissions  broker fees and other selling expenses attributable to the sales growth in the company s core operations  iii increased minimum royalty payments associated with the revlon line of vitamins  iv increased distribution expenses attributable to higher levels of shipments associated with the company s core operations and intergel s sales activities  and v expenses relating to the initial operations of the intergel division 
the overall increase was partially offset by the savings resulting from the coordination of certain sales  marketing  distribution and general and administrative functions between the east coast and west coast operations subsequent to the hall merger in april  the reduced levels of advertising and promotion costs associated with the revlon product line compared to  during which time significant expenditures were incurred associated with the launch of the line

cost of sales for the year ended july  was million  an increase of million  or  over the year ended july  cost of sales decreased as a percentage of net sales 
such decrease as a percentage of sales was due to i an improvement in the overall sales mix towards higher margin products such as the company s fields of nature brand  the new herbal product line and the new revlon vitamin line  ii the reduction in net sales attributable to the company s contract manufacturing division  whose products are generally sold at lower profit margins  iii a general decrease in the company s manufacturing costs resulting from the improvement in manufacturing efficiencies stemming from higher volume in the company s tablet manufacturing divisions where longer production runs coupled with larger batch sizes enabled the company to attain lower packaging and manufacturing costs on a per unit basis  iv lower acquisition costs of certain raw materials attributable in part to the increased purchasing power of the company as a result of the recent merger with hall
