the company expects to spend up to million on stock repurchases in to partially hedge the cost of its stock repurchase program  the company sold put warrants and purchased call options in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
to provide for financial flexibility and increased liquidity  the company has established several sources of debt financing 
the company has million available under its million debt shelf registration 
the shelf registration was increased in january from million to million 
at december   million of debt securities were outstanding and bear interest at fixed rates averaging 
the current portion of these debt securities is million  and the remaining debt securities mature in two to seven years

as of december   the company had no outstanding commercial paper 
the company also has a million revolving line of credit  on which there were no borrowings outstanding at december  the primary objectives for the company s investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made to achieve the highest rate of return to the company  consistent with these two objectives 
the company s investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 
the company invests its excess cash in securities with varying maturities to meet projected cash needs 
the company believes that existing funds  cash generated from operations and existing sources of debt financing are adequate to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future  as well as to support its stock repurchase program 
however  the company may raise additional capital from time to time to take advantage of favorable conditions in the markets or in connection with the company s corporate development activities 
results of operations product sales product sales increased million or in over the prior year 
in  product sales increased million or over the prior year 
neupogen r filgrastim the company s worldwide neupogen r sales were  million in  an increase of million or over the prior year 
in  sales were million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
domestic sales of neupogen r were million in  an increase of million or over the prior year due primarily to growth in demand and a price increase which was in line with the consumer price index 
in  domestic sales were million  an increase of million or over the prior year due primarily to the increased usage of neupogen r and price increases 
quarterly neupogen r sales volume in the united states is influenced by a number of factors including underlying demand and wholesaler inventory management practices 
wholesaler inventory reductions tend to reduce domestic neupogen r sales in the first quarter each year 
in addition  the discretionary aspects of some cancer chemotherapy administration has had a slight seasonal effect on neupogen r sales 
cost containment pressures in the health care marketplace have contributed to the slowing of growth in domestic neupogen r usage over the past several years 
these pressures are expected to continue to influence such growth for the foreseeable future 
despite these pressures  the company believes that neupogen r sales have continued to grow in because the company focused its marketing efforts on specific tumor types and on the ability neupogen r to partially offset its own costs by decreasing the likelihood of infections requiring hospitalization 
the introduction and use of new myelosuppressive chemotherapy agents and the approval of neupogen r for use in peripheral blood progenitor cell transplants is also believed to have contributed to sales growth 
international sales of neupogen r  primarily in europe  were million in  an increase of million or over the prior year 
unit demand accounted for most of this increase but was partially offset by the weakening of foreign currencies 
in  international sales of neupogen r were million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
three factors  each contributing approximately one third  accounted for this increase in strong unit demand growth  the inclusion of sales from three additional countries as the result of austria  sweden and finland joining the european union eu on january   and the favorable effects of strengthened foreign currencies 
prior to the entry of the three additional countries into the eu  f 
hoffmann la roche paid the company royalties on sales in these countries under a license agreement 
the company s overall share of the colony stimulating factor csf market in the eu in which neupogen r competes has continued to decrease since the introduction in of a competing granulocyte csf product 
the company does not expect the competitive intensity to subside in the near future 
while sales in the eu have continued to increase  government budget issues and cost controls have also slowed the growth of the csf market in the eu 
epogen r epoetin alfa epogen r sales were  million in  an increase of million or over the prior year 
in  epogen r sales were million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
these increases were primarily due to increases in the us dialysis patient population and the administration of higher doses  and to a lesser extent  increased penetration of the dialysis market 
increases in both the us dialysis patient population and dosing are expected to continue to drive epogen r sales 
these drivers remained strong throughout as the company focused its marketing efforts on the benefits of increasing patients hematocrit levels 
however  the company believes that as more dialysis patients hematocrits reach target levels  dosing increases will diminish 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the improvement in the current year reflects efficiencies from the company s fill and finish facility in puerto rico 
in  cost of sales as a percentage of product sales is expected to be in the range of to as a result of continuing efficiencies in the puerto rico facility 
research and development in and  research and development expenses increased million or and million or  respectively  compared with the respective prior years 
these increases were primarily due to staff related expenses and external costs for clinical and preclinical activities necessary to support ongoing product development activities 
in  annual research and development expenses are expected to increase at a rate slightly exceeding the company s product sales growth rate 
increases are planned for internal efforts on development of product candidates  for discovery and for licensing efforts 
write off of in process technology purchased in december  the company acquired synergen  inc synergen  a biotechnology company engaged in the discovery and development of protein based pharmaceuticals 
synergen was acquired for million in cash  including related acquisition costs 
the purchase price was assigned to the acquired tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the value assigned to in process technology of million was expensed during the quarter ended december  marketing and selling general and administrative in and  marketing and selling expenses increased million or and million or  respectively  compared with the respective prior years 
these increases primarily reflect market research activities  efforts to increase the number of patients receiving neupogen r and to bring more patients receiving epogen r within the target hematocrit range 
in and  general and administrative expenses increased million or and million or  respectively  compared with the respective prior years 
these increases are primarily due to staff related expenses 
in  marketing and selling expenses combined with general and administrative expenses are expected to have an aggregate annual growth rate that approximates the anticipated annual growth in product sales 
interest and other income in  interest and other income decreased million or compared with the prior year 
this decrease resulted from lower interest rates and lower capital gains related to the company s investment portfolio  partially offset by higher cash balances 
in  interest and other income increased million or over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to capital gains realized in the company s investment portfolio during while capital losses were incurred in and from higher interest rates and cash balances compared with the prior year 
interest and other income is expected to continue to vary from period to period primarily due to changes in cash balances  timing of capital gains losses and fluctuations in interest rates 
income taxes the company s tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in is primarily the result of a favorable ruling received from the puerto rican government with respect to tollgate taxes applicable to earnings in puerto rico 
the decrease in was due to tax benefits from the sale of products manufactured in the puerto rico fill and finish facility which began in the first quarter of the tax rate in was higher than the statutory rate due to the write off of in process technology purchased in connection with the synergen acquisition  which was not deductible for income tax purposes 
in  the tax rate is expected to decrease to approximately 
in  the tax rate is expected to increase to approximately due to a change in the us federal tax law which limits the tax benefits from manufacturing in puerto rico to levels

at december   outstanding foreign currency option and forward contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
financial outlook worldwide neupogen r filgrastim sales for are expected to grow at a rate lower than the growth rate 
future neupogen r sales increases are dependent primarily upon further penetration of existing markets  the timing and nature of additional indications for which the product may be approved and the effects of competitive products 
although not approved or promoted for use in the united states  the company believes that approximately of its domestic neupogen r sales are from off label use as a supportive therapy for various aids related treatments 
changes in aids therapies  including therapies that may be less myelosuppressive  may affect such sales 
neupogen r usage is expected to continue to be affected by cost containment pressures on health care providers worldwide 
in addition  international neupogen r sales will continue to be subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
epogen r epoetin alfa sales for are expected to remain strong but grow at a rate lower than the growth rate 
the company anticipates that increases in both the us dialysis patient population and dosing will continue to drive epogen r sales 
the company believes that  as more dialysis patients hematocrits reach target levels  the contribution of dosing to sales increases will diminish 
patients receiving treatment for end stage renal disease are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government 
therefore  epogen r sales may also be affected by future changes in reimbursement rates or the basis for reimbursement by the federal government 
the company anticipates that total product sales and earnings will grow at double digit rates in  but these growth rates are expected to be lower than growth rates 
estimates of future product sales and earnings  however  are necessarily speculative in nature and are difficult to predict with accuracy 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this annual report on form k are by their nature forward looking 
for the reasons stated in this annual report or in the company s other securities and exchange commission filings  or for various unanticipated reasons  actual results may differ materially 
legal matters the company is engaged in arbitration proceedings with one of its licensees and various other legal proceedings 
for a complete discussion of these matters  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results amgen operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks  and others are discussed elsewhere herein and in other documents filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
product development the company intends to continue an aggressive product development program 
successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain  and only a small minority of research and development programs ultimately result in the commercialization of a product 
of the candidates that are commercialized  all may not be commercially successful 
product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons  including  without limitation  results indicating lack of effectiveness or harmful side effects in clinical or preclinical testing  failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals  uneconomical manufacturing costs  the existence of third party proprietary rights  failure to be cost effective in light of existing therapeutics or other factors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to produce future products that have commercial potential 
additionally  success in preclinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that large scale clinical trials will be successful 
clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations which may delay  limit or prevent further clinical development or regulatory approvals 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and receive approval for product marketing by regulatory authorities varies significantly by product and indication and is often difficult to predict 
see regulatory approvals 
regulatory approvals the company s research and development  preclinical testing  clinical trials  facilities  manufacturing and marketing of its products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the us and other countries 
the success of the company s current products and future product candidates will depend in part upon obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval to market products in approved indications 
even if regulatory approval is obtained  a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continued review 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer may result in restrictions on such product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
failure to obtain necessary approvals  or the restriction  suspension or revocation of any approvals or the failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 
reimbursement  third party payors in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of the company s products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as governments and private insurance plans 
in certain foreign markets pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government controls 
in the united states  there has been  and the company expects there to continue to be  a number of state and federal proposals to implement price controls 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and usage 
further  significant uncertainties exist as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutic products  and current reimbursement policies for existing products may change 
changes in reimbursement or failure to obtain reimbursement may reduce the demand for  or the price of  the company s products which could have a material adverse effect on the company including results of operations 
specifically  patients in the us receiving epogen r in connection with treatment for end stage renal disease are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government 
therefore  epogen r sales may be affected by future changes in reimbursement rates or the basis for reimbursement by the federal government 
guidelines in addition to government agencies that promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to the company and its products  private health science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases may also publish  from time to time  guidelines or recommendations to the healthcare and patient communities 
these private organizations may make recommendations that affect the usage of certain therapies  drugs or procedures  including the company s products 
such recommendations may relate to such matters as usage  dosage  route of administration and use of concomitant therapies 
recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients and healthcare providers and that result in  among other things  decreased use of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the perception that such recommendations or guidelines will be followed could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the company s common stock 
intellectual property and legal matters the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
to date there has emerged no consistent policy regarding breadth of claims allowed in such companies patents 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that patents and patent applications relating to the company s products and technologies will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or will afford protection against competitors with similar products or technology 
patent disputes are frequent and can preclude commercialization of products 
the company currently is  and may in the future be  involved in patent litigation 
such litigation  if decided adversely  could subject the company to significant liabilities  cause the company to obtain third party licenses or cease using the technology or product in dispute 
however  there can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
the company is currently involved in arbitration proceedings with ortho pharmaceutical corporation  a subsidiary of johnson johnson johnson johnson  relating to a license granted by the company to johnson johnson for sales of epoetin alfa in the united states for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  contingencies johnson johnson arbitrations 
competition amgen operates in a highly competitive environment 
the company competes with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  some of which may have technical or competitive advantages  for  among other things  the development of technologies and processes and the acquisition of technology from academic institutions  government agencies and other private and public research organizations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to produce or acquire rights to products that have commercial potential 
even if the company achieves product commercialization  there can be no assurance that one or more of the company s competitors will not achieve product commercialization earlier than the company  receive patent protection that dominates or adversely affects the company s activities or have significantly greater marketing capabilities 
fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons 
historically the company has planned its operating expenses  many of which are relatively fixed in the short term  on the basis that revenues will continue to grow 
accordingly  even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a period s results to be below company expectations 
such a revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors  including  without limitation  lower than expected demand  changes in wholesaler buying patterns  changes in product pricing strategies  increased competition from new and existing products  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in government or private reimbursement  transit interruptions  overall economic conditions or natural disasters including earthquakes 
the company also experiences a degree of seasonality in its operating results 
see results of operations product sales neupogen r filgrastim 
rapid growth the company has adopted an aggressive growth plan that includes substantial and increased investments in research and development and investments in facilities that will be required to support significant growth 
this plan carries with it a number of risks  including a higher level of operating expenses  the difficulty of attracting and assimilating a large number of new employees  and the complexities associated with managing a larger and faster growing organization 
stock price volatility the company s stock price  like that of other biotechnology companies  is subject to significant volatility 
the stock price may be affected by  among other things  clinical trial results and other product development related announcements by amgen or its competitors  regulatory matters  announcements in the scientific and research community  intellectual property and legal matters  changes in reimbursement policies or medical practices or broader industry and market trends unrelated to the company s performance 
in addition  if revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate adverse impact on the company s stock price
