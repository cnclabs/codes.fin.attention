the lower borrowing costs obtained in the refinancing allowed continental s operating lease expense for the affected aircraft to be reduced by more than million annually 
in january and february  continental repurchased or redeemed without prepayment penalty the remaining amount of its series a convertible secured debentures for million including payment in kind interest of million 
in february  continental sold approximately million of the million shares it owned in america west  realizing net proceeds of million and recognizing a gain of million 
in may  the company sold all of its  america west warrants  realizing net proceeds of million and recognizing a gain of million 
in march  continental completed the offering of million of convertible subordinated notes 
in march  continental repaid million of secured indebtedness to general electric capital corporation  general electric company and certain affiliates any one or more of such entities  ge of which million was required as a result of the convertible debt financing and the america west stock sale and million was an optional prepayment  resulting in the elimination of certain restrictive covenants 
in july  continental s owned subsidiary  continental micronesia  inc cmi consummated a million secured term loan financing with a group of banks and other financial institutions 
continental and cmi used the net proceeds  together with available cash  to prepay approximately million in principal amount of ge indebtedness 
the bank financing reduced interest expense by million in and is expected to result in a savings in interest expense of million in  based on current rates 
the bank financing does not contain any restrictive covenants at the continental parent level  and none of the assets of the parent company other than its stock in air micronesia  inc  cmi s parent company is pledged in connection with the financing

as of december   continental had approximately billion including current maturities of long term debt and capital lease obligations  and had approximately million of minority interest  continental obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust  redeemable preferred stock and common stockholders equity  a ratio of to as of december   the ratio of long term debt and capital lease obligations including current maturities to minority interest  continental obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust  redeemable preferred stock and common stockholders equity was to the company had  as of december   deferred tax assets aggregating billion  including million of nols 
the company recorded a valuation allowance of million against such assets as of december  realization of a substantial portion of the company s remaining nols will require the completion by april  of transactions resulting in recognition of built in gains for federal income tax purposes 
the company has consummated several such transactions and currently intends to consummate one or more additional transactions 
if the company were to determine in the future that such transactions will not be completed and if future income is not sufficient to recognize the benefit of previously completed transactions  an adjustment to the net deferred tax liability of up to million would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
as a result of nols  the company will not pay united states federal income taxes other than alternative minimum tax until it has recorded approximately an additional billion of taxable income following december  section of the internal revenue code section imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize nols if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
in the event that an ownership change should occur  utilization of continental s nols would be subject to an annual limitation under section determined by multiplying the value of the company s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate which was for february 
unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years  and the amount of the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by the built in gains in assets held by the company at the time of the change that are recognized in the five year period after the change 
under current conditions  if an ownership change were to occur  continental s nol utilization would be limited to approximately million per year

net cash used by investing activities for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year increased million  primarily as a result of higher capital expenditures in  lower purchase deposits refunded in connection with aircraft delivered in and proceeds received in in connection with the system one transactions 
this increase was offset in part by proceeds received from i sale leaseback transactions in and ii the sale in of approximately million shares of continental s america west stock and all of continental s america west warrants

cmi entered into an interest rate swap agreement and an interest rate cap agreement to reduce the impact of potential increases in interest rates on its bank financing that was completed in july the company has entered into petroleum option contracts to provide some short term protection against a sharp increase in jet fuel prices  and cmi has entered into average rate option contracts to hedge a portion of its japanese yen denominated ticket sales against a significant depreciation in the value of the yen versus the united states dollar

the company anticipates that it will be able to offset a significant portion of wage and other cost increases with increased labor productivity  reduced interest and lease expenses  reduced distribution costs and other cost savings 
continental s decision to order new boeing and aircraft which will replace older  less efficient stage aircraft is expected to increase ownership costs while generating cost savings in the areas of maintenance  fuel and pilot training 
management believes that the company s costs are likely to be affected in the future by i higher aircraft rental expense as new aircraft are delivered  ii higher wages  salaries and related costs as the company continues to compensate its employees comparable to industry average  iii changes in the costs of materials and services in particular  the cost of fuel  which can fluctuate significantly in response to global market conditions  iv changes in governmental regulations and taxes affecting air transportation and the costs charged for airport access  including new security requirements  v changes in the company s fleet and related capacity and vi the company s continuing efforts to reduce costs throughout its operations  including reduced maintenance costs for new aircraft  reduced distribution expense from using continental s electronic ticket product e ticket and the internet for bookings  and reduced interest expense
