results of operations fiscal year ended june   vs 
fiscal year ended june  tuition revenues in fiscal increased by million  or from fiscal this was the largest tuition revenue increase in the history of the company 
the increase in tuition revenues was produced by several positive factors  including the june acquisition of becker cpa review 
enrollment increases at devry institutes and keller graduate school of management kgsm also contributed to the tuition revenue increase 
fiscal marks the seventh consecutive year at devry institutes in which cumulative total student enrollment for the three semesters during the year have increased from the previous year 
at kgsm  cumulative total student enrollment for the five terms of fiscal grew by compared to fiscal enrollment increases at the devry institutes reflect the opening of a new institute in mississauga  ontario  canada  and at kgsm  the opening of new centers in oakbrook terrace  illinois  and irvine  california 
tuition revenues also increased because of tuition rate increases of approximately  which became effective at devry institutes in march and at kgsm in september other educational revenues  composed primarily of sales of books and supplies  increased by million  or  because of sales to the increased number of students attending the companys educational programs 
interest income on the companys short term investments of cash balances decreased by  or  from the prior year because increased capital spending and aggressive debt reduction payments reduced average cash balances in excess of those needed for daily operations 
cost of educational services increased by million  or  in fiscal from the previous year 
cost of educational services includes the cost of faculty and related staff  which consistently comprises approximately of this expense category also included in this expense category are the costs of facilities  supplies  bookstore sales  other student education related support activities and the cost of tuition refunds and uncollectible accounts 
the increase in cost of educational services reflects the additional faculty  staff and facility costs of the becker operations that were not a part of the companys results for fiscal also  there were higher wage  benefit  supply and service expenses associated with the growing number of operating locations and increased student enrollments at devry institutes and at kgsm 
depreciation expense increased by million  or  from fiscal as a result of extensive capital improvements and additions  particularly those related to the opening of the new devry institutes in north brunswick  new jersey  and mississauga  ontario  canada  and the continued expansion and upgrading of school laboratories and teaching equipment throughout the system 
tuition refunds and bad debt expense at devry institutes declined by approximately  from last year  even as total student enrollments increased 
this results from educational program and student service quality initiatives that favorably affected student retention 
student services and administrative expense increased by million  or  from fiscal student services and administrative expense includes the costs of new student recruiting  general and administrative costs  and curriculum development 
the increase this year in student services and administrative expense reflects costs associated with beckers operations  which were not included in last years results 
the increased spending also reflects the marketing costs associated with generating the higher student enrollments at devry institutes and at kgsm for the terms that began in fiscal and for their summer terms that begin in fiscal general and administrative expense increased from last year and includes the ongoing costs of efforts o restore unconditional financial aid processing at the toronto area campuses 
the increase in student services and administrative cost also includes approximately million in amortization of intangibles and goodwill primarily associated with the becker acquisition 
the companys fiscal earnings from operations  before interest expense and taxes  were a record million 
operating margins  which have been steadily increasing each year  increased again to  up from and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
operating margins were favorably affected by the inclusion of beckers results  where operating margins have historically been higher  by the higher revenues and improved facility utilization from the increased enrollments at devry institutes and kgsm  by continued operations improvements and by cost containment measures 
interest expense increased by million from last year because of higher outstanding debt levels resulting from the acquisition  for cash  of becker in june this increased interest expense was offset  in part  during the latter part of the fiscal year by the proceeds of the april stock offering  which were used to reduce debt 
the provision for income taxes of million represents a rate on pretax income 
this years rate is lower than the rate in fiscal because of a lower effective state income tax rate on the companys us operations 
net income of million  or per share  was a record for any year  increasing by from fiscal fiscal year ended june   vs 
fiscal year ended june  tuition revenues in fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal this increase was attributable to both higher student enrollment at devry institutes and kgsm and  to a lesser extent  to tuition increases implemented during the year 
cumulatively  total student enrollment at the devry institutes in the three semesters of fiscal increased by compared with fiscal this was partly due to higher enrollments at the long beach  california  and scarborough  ontario  canada  campuses  both of which opened in the previous year  and partly due to increased enrollments at the previously existing devry institutes 
fiscal was the sixth consecutive year that cumulative total student enrollment at devry institutes increased from the previous year and the largest rise in any of those years 
at kgsm  cumulative total student enrollment for the five terms of fiscal grew by compared to fiscal the increase in enrollments was due to higher enrollments at the pomona and long beach  california  centers  both of which opened in fiscal  the fiscal opening of a center in tysons corner  virginia washington  dc area  and continued growth in enrollments at the previously existing centers 
tuition increases have historically been implemented by devry institutes effective with the spring term and effective with the fall term at kgsm 
tuition rates rose approximately at devry  which is slightly below the rate of the increase in fiscal and below the average rate of tuition increases at other colleges and universities 
tuition rates rose similarly at kgsm 
other educational revenues increased by million  or  because of sales of books and supplies to the increased number of students attending the companys educational programs 
interest income on short term investments of cash balances declined by  or  from fiscal  as the higher level of payments for taxes on income  payments and accounts receivable increases associated with financial aid processing at the toronto area campuses and completion of the new devry institute campus in north brunswick  new jersey  reduced average investible balances during fiscal cost of educational services rose by million  or  in fiscal from fiscal costs associated with the new devry institutes and kgsm centers contributed to this increase  along with higher educational costs resulting from higher student enrollments at existing locations 
depreciation expense on the companys continued investment in facilities and equipment for its students increased by million or from fiscal tuition refund and uncollectible account expense increased in the year partly because of higher enrollments and higher tuition revenue at devry institutes and kgsm and partly because of the higher proportion of new devry institutes students in fiscal as a result of growing new student enrollments 
new student enrollment at the devry institutes increased by from fiscal to fiscal new students historically withdraw at higher rates than do students in later terms 
student services and administrative expense increased by million  or  from fiscal marketing costs have grown to support the new devry institutes and kgsm locations and to support the higher number of new students recruited at the existing locations 
general and administrative expenses increased from fiscal partly due to normal inflationary change and partly because of costs associated with the effects of the ontario ministry of education and trainings suspension and subsequent conditional reinstatement of financial aid eligibility for students attending the companys toronto area campuses 
the companys earnings from operations  before interest expense and taxes on income  reached a record million for fiscal this represents an operating margin of  up from and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
higher revenues and cost containment measures contributed to the improved margins 
interest expense was reduced by million  or  to million for fiscal from fiscal the lower interest expense resulted from lower outstanding levels of debt throughout most of fiscal and the absence of the non recurring make whole premium payment made in fiscal  when the company voluntarily prepaid all of its senior subordinated notes 
net income of million  or per share  was a record for any fiscal year  increasing by from fiscal liquidity and capital resources the companys primary source of liquidity is the cash received from student payments for tuition  fees and books 
these payments include cash from student and family educational loans  from other financial aid under various federal  state and provincial programs  and from student and family resources 
the pattern of cash receipts is somewhat seasonal 
the level of accounts receivable from which cash payments are collected reaches a peak immediately after the billing of tuition  fees and books at the beginning of devry institutes semesters  which begin in july  november and march 
collections of devry institute receivables are heaviest at the start of each semester 
in the first two months of each semester  collections typically exceed payments for operating expenses applicable to that period 
accounts receivable reach their lowest level just prior to the start of the next semester  dropping to their lowest point in the year at the end of june 
the end of june corresponds to both the end of the spring semester and to the end of a financial aid year  t which time substantially all financial aid for the previous months has been disbursed to students accounts 
both kgsm and becker also experience seasonality in their cash receipts and expenditures based upon their respective operating cycles 
at june   total company accounts receivable  net of the related deferred tuition revenue  increased by less than  the increase in receivables was generated by higher enrollment and revenue levels in the companys educational programs 
the company estimates that historically slightly less than of devry institutes tuition  bookstore and fee revenues have been financed by government provided financial aid to its students 
these financial aid and assistance programs are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations 
there is no assurance that such funding will be maintained at current levels 
extensive and complex regulations in the united states and canada govern all of the government financial assistance programs in which the companys students participate 
the companys administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies 
any regulatory violation could be the basis for disciplinary action  including initiation of a suspension  limitation or termination proceeding against the company 
under the terms of the companys participation in governmental financial aid programs  certain cash received from the us department of education is maintained in restricted bank accounts 
this cash becomes available for general use by the company only after student loans and grants have been credited to the accounts of students and the cash is transferred to an unrestricted operating cash account 
the introduction of electronic fund transfers for student loans and the direct loan program from the department of education have generally accelerated the receipt and processing of these payments by devry institutes and kgsm  contributing to the companys liquidity 
at june   cash held in restricted bank accounts was reduced to million  down nearly million from the end of the previous year 
in july  the company entered into an out of court settlement agreement with the internal revenue service irs relative to the statutory notice of deficiency issued by the irs against the company for tax years through the claimed deficiencies related to the amortization of intangible assets purchased during the acquisition of devry institutes in all of these issues have been resolved as a result of the settlement 
the settlement amount was paid in the first quarter of fiscal and is immaterial to companys financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
cash generated from operations in fiscal reached a record million after remaining at approximately million in each of the last two years 
higher earnings  the increased non cash sources of depreciation and amortization  plus an increase in deferred tuition revenue accounted for nearly million of the increased operating cash flow 
traditionally  the company has been able to help fund its expansion through operations with negative working capital during most of the year 
the generation and use of cash during the year reflects the seasonal operating patterns discussed above 
during some periods just prior to the start of a semester  cash balances may be supplemented by temporary borrowings under the companys revolving line of credit 
cash generated from operations each year has been sufficient to meet all of the companys operating needs and capital investment needs  while reducing debt on a regular basis 
capital expenditures in fiscal reached a record million 
capital expenditures were made for expansion and facility improvement  replacement and upgrading of school laboratories and for teaching and administrative equipment 
contributing to s record spending were the purchases of land in fremont san francisco  california and west hills los angeles  california  both of which will be sites of future devry institutes as a part of the companys expansion plans during the coming years 
capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to decrease somewhat from the record level but should remain significantly above the level of the previous years as construction begins on these new campuses and further expansion at kgsm and becker into new operating sites is accelerated 
cash generated from operations and existing cash resources have been sufficient to meet capital requirements in the past and  with the companys revolving line of credit  are anticipated to be sufficient to cover expansion plans in the future 
in april  the company completed an offering of million additional shares of its common stock 
net proceeds of the offering were approximately million  of which million was used to repay indebtedness under the companys revolving line of credit 
in june  the company and its banks renegotiated the companys revolving term loan agreement to increase the level of annual capital expenditures permitted by the agreement to facilitate current and future expansion plans 
at june   approximately million of the revolving line had been utilized in the form of borrowings and letters of credit  a reduction of million from the level of borrowing one year earlier 
included in these borrowings is a million cdn letter of credit posted with the ontario ministry of education and training in conjunction with the conditional reinstatement of financial aid processing at the companys toronto area campuses 
future borrowings and or repayments will be based upon the companys seasonal cash flow cycle and payment requirements for capital spending and possible future acquisitions 
effective july   the companys bank borrowings are at a floating rate of libor plus 
effective october   the companys bank borrowings will be reduced again to a floating rate of libor plus 
at the present time  the company does not have an interest rate swap or other form of protection against increases in the floating rate but does fix the interval of interest rate adjustment on most of its borrowings for a three to six month period to eliminate some of the possible variability in rates 
the company periodically evaluates its need for additional protection in light of projected changes in interest rate and borrowing levels 
the company believes that current balances of unrestricted cash  cash generated from operations and  if needed  the revolving loan facility  will be sufficient to fund its operations for the foreseeable future
