item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources at december   long term borrowings of million represented of the cost of the aircraft presently owned by the partnership and of total assets 
this debt is outstanding under three long term  non recourse debt facilities collateralized by certain aircraft  two of which are at fixed rates and one which is at a floating rate 
the partnership has entered into an interest rate swap agreement which limits its risk on the floating rate debt 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  were outstanding under these three facilities 
at december   approximately million remained available 
see note of notes to financial statements 
on january   the partnership entered into a fourth long term non recourse note agreement in the amount of million 
approximately million of this loan was utilized to purchase an additional interest in the twa aircraft 
see business the balcap usl capital transaction 
at the time of the acquisition  the partnership already owned a interest in this aircraft  and the loan is collateralized by this aircraft 
the partnership intends to use the balance of this loan for working capital 
total scheduled debt service in including debt service under the loan agreement entered into in january is million and will be paid from revenues  primarily from the rental payments received under its aircraft leases 
existing borrowings secured by aircraft on lease to usair provide for full repayment of the debt by rather than through the end of the expected lease term in see notes and of notes to financial statements 
as this debt is repaid and the related line of credit expires  by the partnership will need to and believes that it would be able to obtain bank or other financing to replace all or a portion of these expiring facilities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  million for  and million for total debt service as a percentage of net cash provided by operating activities was   and for  and  respectively 
in the partnership incurred costs to convert an off lease boeing to a cargo configuration and leased it to fedex under a finance lease 
this caused debt service to increase in due to the payment of these conversion costs  and net cash from operating activities to decrease because  as a finance lease  the fedex lease generates cash from investing activities rather than operating activities 
in debt service increased by million from the prior year due to the timing of debt service payments 
under the loan documents  if december is not a business day as was the case in  the loan payment is due in january  causing debt service to be lower in and higher in net cash provided by operating activities decreased almost million primarily because of reduced rentals resulting from the sale of one aircraft in march note receivable of  represents advances made by the partnership to continental to finance certain aircraft modifications 
the agreement for this financing was entered into as part of a stipulation in continental s bankruptcy 
continental has advised the partnership that because the lease has terminated these amounts are no longer due and the partnership is reviewing continental s claim 
cash distributions paid by the partnership were million per unit in  million per unit in  and million per unit in distributions paid in include a special cash distribution of cents per unit made from the proceeds received from the casualty of one aircraft 
distributions paid in include a special cash distribution of cents per unit made from a portion of the sale proceeds received from the sale of a interest in the aircraft on lease to finnair 
the increase in cash distributions per unit in and are due primarily to the special cash distributions described above 
on january  the partnership made an additional special cash distribution of cents per unit from the proceeds received from the december  sale of its interest in six aircraft 
see plan to restrict transferability of units and cease reinvestment below and business disposition of aircraft 
partnership net income was million in  million in  and million in pursuant to the limited partnership agreement  the partnership distributed all cash available from operations and also made special cash distributions  as described above 
since such distributions were in excess of earnings  partnership equity declined from million at december  to million at december   and limited partner equity per unit declined from to 
from a limited partner perspective  the portion of the distribution in excess of net income constitutes a return of capital 
total cash distributions declared since inception of the partnership have exceeded total net income reflecting a return of capital of per unit  or of the initial capital invested by limited partners 
results of operations in  revenues were earned from seven aircraft subject to finance leases usair  twa  and fedex and nine aircraft subject to operating leases continental  finnair  and sun jet 
twa contributed of total revenues and there were two months november and december of non accrual of twa revenue 
at year end  there were no off lease aircraft and none of the partnership s lessees was in bankruptcy 
in  revenues were earned from seven aircraft subject to finance leases usair  twa  and fedex 
finance lease income declined from as the balances due declined 
twa was on non accrual status early in  but remitted all past due amounts by the third quarter 
twa was in bankruptcy for a portion of  and the twa lease contributed of total revenues 
revenues were earned from nine aircraft subject to operating leases continental  finnair  and sun jet from january through may  and eight aircraft for the balance of the year  reflecting the casualty loss of one aircraft leased to continental 
at year end  there were no off lease aircraft  all of the partnership s lessees were current under their lease agreements  and none was in bankruptcy 
in  revenues were earned from seven aircraft subject to finance leases usair  twa  and fedex 
finance lease income declined from as the balances due declined 
revenues were earned from eight aircraft subject to operating leases continental  finnair  and sun jet from january through march  and seven aircraft for the remainder of the year  reflecting the march sale of the aircraft leased to finnair 
the decline in operating lease rentals is due primarily to the sale of this aircraft 
on december   the operating lease with continental covering six aircraft expired  and the aircraft were sold on that date 
the sales of the partnership s interests in aircraft on lease to finnair and continental produced gains of  and million  respectively 
see note of notes to financial statements 
at year end  there were no off lease aircraft  all of the partnership s lessees were current under their lease agreements and none was in bankruptcy

twa of total year end assets reported a net loss of million on revenues of billion for  compared with a net loss of million on revenues of billion for sun jet of total year end assets while current in its rental obligations throughout  was delinquent in its february rental payment  but this delinquency has been cured 
for information regarding the percentage of total partnership assets and revenues represented by aircraft owned and leased by the partnership  see business aircraft portfolio 
the partnership believes that its revenues and income have not been materially affected by inflation and changing prices because its principal items of revenue rental payments and expenses interest are at fixed long term rates 
interest expense in reflects an average interest rate of based on average total outstanding debt of million  compared to s average interest rate of based on average total outstanding debt of million 
depreciation expense relates to aircraft subject to operating leases and those held for sale or lease 
in depreciation expense decreased because of the march sale of the aircraft on lease to finnair 
in  general and administrative expenses were  which included  in non recurring expenses  primarily related to the early return and repair of the aircraft now on lease to sun jet 
in  the partnership incurred total expenses of  of which  were capitalized  to prepare its dc aircraft for re lease to sun jet 
in  general and administrative expenses increased by  to  primarily because of legal expenses relating to the january acquisition of an interest in an aircraft on lease to twa and the change in tax status 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the partnership adopted the standard january   and the impact on the financial statements was not material 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 earnings per share 
sfas no 
establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share and applies to entities with publicly held common stock or potential common stock 
it is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after december   including interim periods and prior periods presented 
the partnership does not expect that adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or net income per unit 
plan to restrict transferability of units and cease reinvestment on march  the board of directors of the general partner approved a plan to restrict the transferability of units  which will result in delisting of the units from trading on the new york stock exchange in december  and to cease making new aircraft investments  leading to an earlier than planned liquidation of the partnership 
the plan is subject to unitholder approval 
as previously reported to unitholders  airlease will be taxed as if it were a corporation effective january   if its units are freely tradable on that date 
this additional level of tax would substantially reduce distributions to unitholders 
see note of notes to financial statements 
to address the adverse change in tax law  the plan provides that transferability of the units would be restricted in december and the units would be delisted from trading at that time 
although the units would not be freely tradable on the new york stock exchange or a similar secondary market after december  under provisions of the tax law  there are a number of services which may be available to facilitate purchases and sales of units 
at this time it is difficult to know if these services will operate with respect to the units  and irs rules impose various limitations as to the aggregate number of units which may be sold in any year utilizing these services 
if no such services develop unitholders may be unable to sell their units  but they would receive distributions through the remaining term of the partnership 
the plan also provides that airlease would not make any new aircraft investments  would sell its aircraft as attractive opportunities become available and would distribute net sales proceeds to unitholders after each sale 
airlease cannot predict when sales will be made  or provide any assurance as to the prices at which sales will be made 
if the existing aircraft were sold at the end of their lease terms  of the assets would be sold within five years and the remainder by this assumes that all lessees comply with their lease obligations and available lease renewal options are not exercised 
aircraft sales will result in a liquidation of the portfolio over time  and increasingly cash flow and distributions will depend more upon sales proceeds and less upon receipt of regular rental payments  and thus be less predictable 
as previously disclosed  the partnership s sources of capital are limited 
since all cash available from operations is distributed  there is no build up of equity capital and acquisitions must be funded from proceeds when aircraft are sold or from debt 
access to debt is limited because most of the aircraft are being used to secure existing borrowings 
because of these and other factors  airlease cannot compete on the basis of price with many of its competitors which are much larger and have lower capital costs 
as a result  finding investment opportunities that offer an appropriate balance of risk and reward has been very difficult 
in the past five years  the partnership has made only two aircraft investments  both of which were possible because of special circumstances which the general partner believes are unlikely to occur in the future 
as described above  during airlease sold interests in seven aircraft at a profit  but the partnership was unable to reinvest the proceeds in aircraft at an acceptable return  and the general partner determined that the best use of the proceeds was to distribute them to unitholders 
since these sales proceeds were not reinvested in aircraft  the size of the portfolio has been reduced 
these and other factors were considered by the board of directors of the general partner as affecting the competitive position of airlease  and these factors as well as the change in tax law were considered by the board in its decision to propose the plan
