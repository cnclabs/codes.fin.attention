item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
actual results or performance could differ materially then those contemplated  expressed or implied by the forward looking statements contained herein 
general in july  pennfed became the savings and loan holding company of the bank 
currently  the results of operations of the company are primarily those of the bank 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan  securities and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the company s provision for loan losses and operating expenses 
general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities also significantly affect the company s results of operations 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may also have a material impact on the company 
as noted previously  the deposits of savings associations  such as the bank  are presently insured by the saif  which  along with the bif  are the two insurance funds administered by the fdic 
financial institutions which were members of the bif  prior to september   experienced substantially lower deposit insurance premiums because the bif had achieved its required level of reserves while the saif had not yet achieved its required reserves 
as a result of legislation signed into law on september   the saif recapitalization plan provided for a one time assessment of of deposits which was imposed on all saif insured institutions to enable the saif to achieve its required level of reserves 
the assessment was based on deposits as of march   and the bank s special assessment was approximately million  or million  net of taxes 
accordingly  this special one time saif recapitalization assessment significantly increased non interest expenses and adversely effected the company s results of operations for the year ended june  following the recapitalization assessment  beginning january  deposit insurance premiums decreased significantly from the of deposits previously paid by the bank to plus the assessment to be paid to the financing corporation fico 
such assessment for the quarterly period beginning july  amounted to of deposits  on an annualized basis

management strategy management s primary goal continues to be to improve profitability  while continuing to manage interest rate risk  so as to enhance stockholder value  and to foster and maintain customer confidence 
the company s current strategies focus on i emphasizing lending secured by one to four family residential first mortgages  ii increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan portfolios  iii maintaining asset quality  iv increasing deposit balances  v managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk  and vi controlling non interest expenses 
emphasizing lending secured by one to four family residential first mortgages 
the company has emphasized  and plans to continue to emphasize  originating and purchasing traditional one to four family first mortgage loans secured by properties located in new jersey 
correspondent loan purchases of one to four family mortgage loans through june have been primarily secured by properties located throughout new jersey with a limited purchase of loans secured by real estate located in the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
the company has approved the purchase of a limited amount of loans secured by real estate located in the commonwealth of virginia and the commonwealth of massachusetts through an existing correspondent relationship  though none were purchased as of june  the company originated or purchased million  million and million in one to four family mortgage loans in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s interest income has been derived primarily from one to four family mortgage loans on residential real estate which totaled million or of the company s gross loan portfolio at june  increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan portfolios 
in addition to one to four family residential first mortgage lending  the company plans to increase its emphasis on commercial and multi family and consumer lending 
such loans reprice more frequently  have shorter maturities  and or have higher yields than one to four family first mortgage loans 
the company originated million  million and million of commercial and multi family and consumer loans in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has recently established a correspondent relationship with a bank in new jersey as part of an overall effort to increase its commercial and multi family real estate originations 
maintaining asset quality 
the company s loan portfolio consists primarily of one to four family mortgages  which are considered to have less risk than commercial and multi family real estate or consumer loans 
the company s non performing assets consist of non accruing loans and real estate owned 
the company focuses on strong underwriting and collection efforts and aggressive marketing of real estate owned properties 
in addition  the company has occasionally restructured loans by reducing the interest rate or deferring principal and interest payments in order to return the loan to a performing status 
as a result  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets was at june  compared to at june  increasing deposit balances 
the company s primary source of funds is deposits 
deposits have increased  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company plans to continue to emphasize deposit growth  particularly longer term certificates of deposit  and increase its emphasis on transaction accounts 
it has recently emphasized the solicitation of deposits from municipalities 
managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the company has an asset liability committee that meets no less than weekly to price loan and deposit products and monthly to develop  implement and review policies to manage interest rate risk 
the company has endeavored to manage its interest rate risk through the pricing and diversification of its loan and deposit products  including the focus on the origination and purchase of first mortgage loans with shorter terms to maturity and or with adjustable rate features  as well as the origination of commercial and multi family real estate and consumer loans which generally have shorter expected average lives or reprice at shorter intervals than one to four family residential first mortgage products 
in addition  the company has purchased government agency mortgage backed securities with short to intermediate average lives which generally do not exceed years or which have adjustable rate features 
furthermore  as part of its interest rate risk strategy  the company has emphasized longer term certificates of deposit and utilized intermediate term borrowings 
the company has also engaged in intermediate term interest rate swaps designed to extend the maturities of six month certificates of deposit to three to five years 
see interest rate sensitivity and asset liability strategy 
controlling non interest expenses 
non interest expenses are carefully monitored  including ongoing reviews of staffing levels  supplies  facilities and operations 
excluding the effects of the one time saif recapitalization assessment  the company s ratio of non interest expenses to average total assets was for the year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the company s efficiency ratio  excluding the effects of the saif assessment  was for the year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate gap 
the interest rate risk inherent in assets and liabilities may be determined by analyzing the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by measuring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a defined time period if it matures or reprices within that period 
the difference or mismatch between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a defined period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
an institution is considered to have a negative gap if the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
if more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice within a specified period  then the institution is considered to have a positive gap 
accordingly  in a rising interest rate environment  in an institution with a negative gap  the cost of its rate sensitive liabilities would theoretically rise at a faster pace than the yield on its rate sensitive assets  thereby diminishing future net interest income 
in a falling interest rate environment  a negative gap would indicate that the cost of rate sensitive liabilities would decline at a faster pace than the yield on rate sensitive assets and improve net interest income 
for an institution with a positive gap  the reverse would be expected 
in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management closely monitors the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
management maintains an asset liability committee consisting of the chief executive officer  the chief operating officer  the finance group executive  the lending group executive  the retail banking group executive  the treasurer  the controller and the director of product management customer service  which meets regularly and reviews the company s interest rate risk position and makes recommendations for adjusting this position 
in addition  the board reviews on a monthly basis the company s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the company s capital and earnings of various interest rate scenarios and operational strategies 
the following table provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps 
except for the effects of prepayments and scheduled principal amortization on mortgage related assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by the earlier of term to repricing or contractual term to maturity 
callable government agency securities are assumed to be called within one year 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
residential fixed and adjustable rate loans are assumed to have annual payment rates between and of the portfolio 
commercial and multi family real estate loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and while consumer loans are assumed to prepay at a rate 
fixed and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  including cmos and remics  have annual payment assumptions ranging from to 
demand loans and loans which have no repayment schedule or stated final maturity  are assumed to be due within six months 
loan and mortgage backed securities balances are net of non performing loans and are not adjusted for unearned discounts  premiums  and deferred loan fees 
the company assumes  based on historical information  that million or of savings accounts at june   are core deposits and are  therefore  expected to roll off after five years 
the remaining savings accounts are assumed to roll off over the first eighteen months 
transaction accounts  excluding money market accounts  are assumed to roll off after five years 
money market accounts are assumed to be variable accounts and are reported as repricing within six months

the company s negative gap position improved from june  as a result of significant growth in medium term funds and adjustable rate residential first and second mortgage loan products 
new loan activity was strong and residential refinance activity remained relatively slow during the year 
second mortgage activity was re focused and emphasized variable and medium term fixed rate products 
as a result of continued emphasis on generating longer term deposits  growth in two through five year certificates of deposit far out paced activity in the shorter term products 
furthermore  in an effort to lengthen the maturities of interest bearing liabilities  the company supplemented funding needs through the use of fhlb of new york medium term advances and engaged in interest rate swaps 
callable government agency securities  with final maturities of seven years or less  but initially callable within one year and periodically thereafter  have also been purchased to supplement loan growth 
such investments are anticipated to be called prior to their stated final maturities 
in evaluating the company s exposure to interest rate risk  certain limitations inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features which restrict changes in interest rates in the short term and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the company considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk 
net portfolio value 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is regularly monitored by management through selected interest rate risk irr measures set forth by the ots 
the irr measures used by the ots include an irr exposure measure or post shock npv ratio and a sensitivity measure 
a low post shock npv ratio indicates greater exposure to irr 
greater exposure can result from a low initial npv ratio or high sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline 
at least quarterly  and generally monthly  management models the change in net portfolio value npv over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
an npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that rate scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
as of june   the bank s internally generated initial npv ratio was 
following a increase in interest rates  the bank s post shock npv ratio was 
the change in the npv ratio  or the bank s sensitivity measure was 
npv is also measured internally on a consolidated basis 
as of june   the company s initial npv ratio was  the post shock ratio was  and the sensitivity measure was 
variances between the bank s and the company s npv ratios are attributable to balance sheet items which are adjusted during consolidation  such as intercompany borrowings and capital 
internally generated npv measurements are based on simulations which utilize institution specific assumptions and  as such  generally result in lower levels of presumed interest rate risk ie  higher post shock npv ratio and lower sensitivity measure than ots measurements indicate 
the ots measures the bank s unconsolidated irr on a quarterly basis using data from the quarterly thrift financial reports  coupled with non institution specific assumptions which are based on national averages 
as of june   the bank s initial npv ratio  as measured by the ots  was 
the bank s post shock ratio was and the sensitivity measure was 
at june  the bank s initial npv ratio was  the post shock ratio was and the sensitivity measure was 
in addition to monitoring npv and gap  management also monitors the duration of assets and liabilities and the effects on net interest income resulting from parallel and non parallel increases or decreases in rates 
at june   based on its internally generated simulation models  the company s consolidated net interest income projected for one year forward would decrease from the base case  or current market  as a result of an immediate and sustained increase in interest rates 
asset liability strategy the primary elements of the company s asset liability strategy include the following the company focuses on shortening the average life and duration of its portfolio of one to four family mortgage loans by promoting one year adjustable rate products  with initial fixed rate terms of  and years  and year bi weekly mortgages and fixed rate products with terms of  and years 
the company is increasing its emphasis on the origination of variable rate home equity lines and fixed rate second mortgage loans as well as variable and fixed rate commercial and multi family real estate loans having maturities or terms to repricing significantly shorter than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
during fiscal  the company purchased government agency guaranteed investments with final maturities within seven years which are initially callable within one year and periodically thereafter 
such investments are expected to be called prior to their final maturities 
the company may continue to purchase such investments  as well as government agency guaranteed mortgage backed securities with an expected average life at purchase of years or less  as needed  in accordance with its strategic objectives 
the company emphasizes the lengthening of maturities of its liabilities through its pricing of longer term certificates of deposit and by utilizing intermediate term fhlb of new york advances and interest rate swaps  subject to market conditions 
the company is increasing its emphasis on transaction accounts as such funds are lower cost alternatives to certificates of deposit and fhlb of new york advances and strengthen customer relationships 
approximately  or million  of the total net growth of million experienced in one to four family mortgages between june  and june  was accomplished in the adjustable rate portfolio and approximately  or million  of the million total net growth in the consumer lending portfolio was attributable to growth in variable rate home equity lines of credit 
adjustable rate commercial and multi family real estate loans increased approximately from june  to million  while fixed rate commercial and multi family real estate loans declined approximately to million 
additionally  medium and long term funds increased approximately  or million  from june  through the use of interest rate swaps designed to synthetically lengthen the maturities of short term deposits as well as growth in two through five year certificates of deposit  fhlb of new york advances and other borrowings 
short term funds one year or less remained relatively constant 
generally  the investment policy of the company is to invest funds not utilized in its lending activities or required for other corporate purposes among various categories of investments and maturities based upon the company s asset liability management policies 
investments generally include us treasury and government agency securities and mortgage backed securities 
additionally  the company emphasizes and promotes its savings  money market and transaction accounts  and certificates of deposit with varying maturities through five years  principally within its primary market areas 
the balances of savings  money market and transaction accounts  which represented approximately  or million  of total deposits at june   tend to be less susceptible to rapid changes in interest rates than certificates of deposit balances 
collectively  these strategies resulted in a narrowing of the company s interest rate gap and a reduction in irr during fiscal management will continue to monitor and employ such strategies  as necessary  in conjunction with its overall strategic objectives

net interest and dividend income 
net interest and dividend income for the year ended june   was million  reflecting an increase from million recorded in the prior fiscal year 
the increase reflects the company s growth in assets  primarily in adjustable rate residential one to four family mortgage loans 
the net interest rate spread and net interest margin for the current fiscal year were and  respectively  a decline from and  respectively  during fiscal the decline was partially attributable to the company s efforts to reduce its sensitivity to changes in interest rates by extending the average life of liabilities and focusing on adjustable rate one to four family mortgage loans 
this resulted in the company paying higher rates to attract longer term deposits and initially receiving lower yields on adjustable rate loans than would otherwise be obtainable on fixed rate loans 
since the company s liabilities generally reprice more quickly than its assets  net interest rate spread and net interest margins will likely decrease if interest rates rise

while scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable  deposit flows and early loan repayments are more influenced by interest rates  general economic conditions and competition 
the company has competitively set rates on deposit products for selected terms and  when necessary  has supplemented deposits with longer term or less expensive alternative sources of funds 
federal regulations require the bank to maintain minimum levels of liquid assets 
the required percentage has varied from time to time based upon economic conditions and savings flows and is currently of net withdrawable savings deposits and borrowings payable on demand or in one year or less during the preceding calendar month
