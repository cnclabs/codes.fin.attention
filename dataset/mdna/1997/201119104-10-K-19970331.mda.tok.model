results of operations for the years ended december   and reit income reit income is taxable income computed as prescribed for reits prior to the dividends paid deduction including the dividends paid deduction for dividends related to capital gains 
the company s reit income for the years ended december   and was  
per share   
per share and  
per share  respectively 
reit income from cmbs bonds during  and was  per share   
per share and  
per share  respectively 
the increase in earnings from cmbs bonds from to was the result of a  increase in amortization primarily due to i the may redemption of two cmbs bonds aspen mhc  series  class c and class d  and ii prepayments on two other cmbs bonds during the proceeds from the redemption have been invested in short term cash instruments resulting in lower bond interest income subsequent to the redemption 
the increase in earnings from cmbs bonds from to was the result of the acquisition of ten subordinate cmbs bonds for   par value during with coupon interest rates ranging from to and a weighted average yield before credit losses for reit purposes of 
the yield exceeds the coupon interest rate because the subordinate cmbs bonds were sold to the company with original issue discount or market discount ie  the acquisition price of the cmbs bond was lower than its par value 
accordingly  the company amortizes a portion of the discount the excess of the outstanding par amount over the net cost  as interest income  on a constant effective yield under the interest method over the life of the cmbs bond 
amortization of the discount into reit income from certain of the company s cmbs bonds is limited to principal received 
as of february   one mortgage loan with an outstanding balance of  which collateralizes two of the company s cmbs bonds  has been in foreclosure 
otherwise  there have been no delinquencies 
as of december   there have been no credit losses charged to operations or write downs charged against the allowance for credit losses 
the company estimates that the loss from the mortgage loan in foreclosure may range from to  dependent upon the recovery of indemnification claims made against the bond underwriter 
for reit purposes  credit losses are reflected in income only when they are realized 
in future periods  the company likely will be allocated credit losses on its cmbs bonds  and as a result  reit income may be adversely impacted 
see forward looking information below 
interest income in  and was  
per share   
per share and  
per share  respectively 
the increase in interest income in as compared to is due to investing the proceeds from the may redemption of two cmbs bonds into highly liquid  short term investments 
in  prior to the acquisition of the company s cmbs bonds  the unused proceeds of the initial capitalization were invested in highly liquid short term investments 
as the company acquired cmbs bonds using liquid short term investments  interest income decreased 
the average interest rate earned on these funds was  and in  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses of the company were  
per share   
per share and  
per share  respectively  for the years ended december   and general and administrative expenses decreased in compared to prior years primarily due to  among other things  elimination of the expense from the accrual of dividend equivalent rights ders in may and lower costs for shareholder relations 
general and administrative expenses in included a one time expense of  
per share incurred to have a third party assess the fair value of the company s net assets 
on may   the company s shareowners approved an amendment to the stock option plan at its annual meeting permitting the company to issue shares of common stock in the second quarter of to the holders of stock options who voluntarily gave up their ders  as defined in the company s stock option plan which was established in the amendment also eliminated provisions in the stock option plan that would have permitted the issuance of ders in connection with stock options granted in the future 
the issuance of common stock in exchange for the right to receive ders resulted in a one time charge to income of   non cash charge for the issuance of  shares of common stock plus  of transaction costs during the second quarter of management fees of the company were  
per share   
per share  and  
per share  respectively  for the years ended december   and the increase in management fees during compared with was due to an increase of  in incentive fees  offset by decreases of  in base fees and  in administrative fees 
the increase in incentive fees was due to a  increase in reit income before incentive fees and a basis point decrease in the average ten year us treasury rate between and the decrease in base fees was due primarily to a reduction of invested assets because of a  unrealized holding loss on the cmbs bonds recorded at december   and because of the early redemption of the two cmbs bonds in the second quarter of the decrease in administrative fees was also due to the may   redemption of the two cmbs bonds 
the increase in management fees during compared with was due to i  of incentive fees incurred during  while no incentive fees were incurred in  and ii higher base and administrative fees from acquisitions of cmbs bonds throughout during the years ended december   and  interest expense  including non usage fees on the company s secured loan agreement  was  
per share   
per share and  
per share  respectively 
due to the cash available from the early redemptions  there were only limited borrowings in the decrease in interest expense in compared with was due to a decrease in the weighted average outstanding balance of debt of  in compared with  in  partially offset by the increase in the effective interest rate of the company s secured loans during of compared with in dividend distributions during  and  the company declared regular dividends of 
per share  
per share and 
per share  respectively 
additionally  in and special dividends of 
per share and 
per share  respectively  were distributed 
book income for the years ended december   and  the company earned book income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  gaap of  
per share   
per share and  
per share  respectively  essentially from the same sources as its reit income 
reconciliation of reit income and book income the company computes its income in accordance with the code reit income and in accordance with gaap book income 
as a reit  the company s reit income is the basis upon which the code requires the company to make distributions to its shareowners 
however  because the company s common stock is registered with the commission  the company is required to report its financial position and income in accordance with gaap 
the differences between reit income and book income are discussed below 
during the years ended december   and  reit income exceeded book income by  
per share   
per share and  
per share  respectively 
substantially all of this difference is due to i the method of recording credit losses  which for reit income purposes are not deducted until they occur as of december   no credit losses had been realized and which for book income purposes are estimated and reflected as a reduction of revenues in the form of lower discount amortization included in interest income from cmbs bonds  ii the method of amortizing purchase price discounts  which for reit income purposes is subject to certain limitations not applicable for book income purposes  and iii differences in the timing of recognition of the expense from ders 
fair value of financial instruments the fair value of the company s financial instruments generally approximates their carrying basis  or amortized cost  except for the cmbs bonds 
due to the complex nature of subordinate cmbs bonds  each instrument has a discrete and unique risk return profile 
not only do cmbs bonds vary significantly from issuance to issuance  but the characteristics of the individual mortgage loans underlying the securities of one issuance are distinct from the mortgage loans underlying certificates of another issuance 
as a result  there is no exchange or other active market from which to obtain a quoted market price for these financial instruments 
the estimates of fair value have been determined by the company using available market information and valuation methodologies 
considerable judgment is required to interpret the market information and develop the estimates of fair value 
the estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the company could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions  valuation methodologies or both may have a material effect on the estimates of fair value 
the fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of december  future estimates of fair value may differ significantly from amounts presented herein 
the fair value of the company s cmbs bonds will fluctuate over time due to  among other things  changes in prevailing interest rates  changes in collateral performance  liquidity in the cmbs bond market  paydowns on the mortgage loans collateralizing the cmbs bonds and changes in real estate values of the related commercial properties 
the estimate of fair value was determined by discounting the future cash flows before estimates of credit losses of the cmbs bonds at interest rates equal to a spread over us treasury rates with comparable terms to maturity 
the discount rates range from to 
the interest rate spread over the us treasury rate was based upon current market information of cmbs bonds with similar characteristics 
see forward looking information below 
at december   the estimated fair value of the company s cmbs bonds was  or  less than their amortized cost of  compared to the estimated fair value at december  of  or  less than their amortized cost of  the decrease in unrealized holding losses on the company s two largest bonds is partially offset by increased unrealized holding losses on the remaining bonds 
the improvement in fair value of the company s two largest cmbs bonds is attributed to prepayments on the underlying collateral which shortened the term to maturity 
the decline in value of the remaining cmbs bonds is primarily attributed to the basis point increase in interest rates offset by the impact of lower spreads to treasuries from december  to december  liquidity and capital resources the company uses its cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources to provide working capital to support its operations  for making distributions to its shareowners  for the acquisition of portfolio assets and for the repayment of short term borrowings 
the company did not acquire any cmbs bonds in or  and does not plan to use leverage to acquire bonds in the future without having a source of long term financing in place 
for the years ended december   and  cash flow provided by operating activities was   and  respectively 
as of december   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents which the company currently intends to use to pay its expenses  make dividend distributions to shareowners and acquire portfolio assets 
see forward looking information below 
the company was capitalized with  pursuant to the contribution agreement including  cash from asset investors 
during  the company acquired one cmbs bond at a cost of  during the year ended december   the company acquired ten additional cmbs bonds at a cost of  two of the company s cmbs bonds aspen mhc  series  classes c and d with a total outstanding balance of  were redeemed in may the redemption of these cmbs bonds occurred eight years earlier than anticipated 
the proceeds from the bond redemption have been invested in short term cash instruments until a long term strategy is determined 
the company renewed its loan and security agreement collateralized by four cmbs bonds through november  no borrowings were outstanding on this line at december  or advances bear interest based upon a spread over the london interbank offered rate on eurodollar deposits libor 
the loan and security agreement contains certain covenants with which the company was in compliance at december  the amount the company will be able to borrow under its secured credit facility is subject to lender approval and will vary depending on the value of the collateral pledged to secure such facility 
on july   the company renewed a one year  unsecured line of credit with a bank for  advances bear interest at prime 
at december   no advances were outstanding on this line of credit 
the indentures of the commercial securitizations in which the company has acquired cmbs bonds generally provide for substantial penalties if the mortgage loans underlying the commercial securitization are prepaid  and the prepayments generally are allocated to the senior bond classes before the subordinate bond classes which the company generally owns 
significant principal distributions to subordinate cmbs bonds generally are not anticipated before the scheduled principal distributions 
the company s ability to acquire additional assets will depend on  among other things  unanticipated principal prepayments such as the  of cmbs bonds redeemed in may  obtaining new debt or equity capital  or liquidating the existing portfolio of cmbs bonds 
there is no assurance the company will be able to identify new asset acquisition opportunities that meet the company s acquisition criteria or that the company will be able to raise additional funds  whether from principal prepayments  borrowings  issuances of debt or equity securities  liquidation of the current portfolio or other sources 
see forward looking information below 
as a reit  the company is required  among other things  to distribute annually to its shareowners at least of its reit income 
by qualifying for the favorable tax treatment accorded to a reit and by distributing to its shareowners of the company s reit income  the company generally will not be required to pay income tax at the corporate level 
the company anticipates its reit income from cmbs bonds will exceed the related cash flow due to the inherent structure and pricing of the subordinate cmbs bonds 
the subordinate classes of cmbs bonds purchased by the company were issued at a significant discount to their par value 
in accordance with the code  this discount generally is amortized into income over the life of the cmbs bond a non cash source of reit income 
under the code  the company has elected an income recognition methodology for certain of its cmbs bonds that computes income attributable to the amortization of market discount as the lesser of i the amount of principal received from the cmbs bond during the year  or ii the computed discount amortization 
the effect of this election is to defer a portion of the amount of the company s reit income from non cash discount amortization from the early years in the life of the applicable bonds to later years when significant repayments of principal are expected to be received 
the company was able to make this election on four cmbs bonds which had an outstanding principal balance of  at december  subordinate cmbs bonds acquired by the company are relatively non liquid and  as a result  the company s ability to change its portfolio quickly in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited 
in addition  reit rules applicable to the company may restrict the company s ability to sell assets within four years of their acquisition 
under the code  a redemption or prepayment does not constitute a sale 
as the holder of subordinate cmbs bonds which generally are allocated all losses on the underlying mortgage loans until the principal balance of the bond is exhausted  the company has significant credit risk 
these bonds are subject to a greater risk of loss of principal and non payment of interest than the more senior bonds secured by the same assets 
if a borrower defaults on a commercial mortgage loan that is pledged as collateral for a commercial mortgage loan securitization  and the proceeds of the foreclosure of the property are less than the unpaid balance of the mortgage plus foreclosure costs principal and interest advances through foreclosure sale  repair and maintenance costs during the foreclosure  brokerage fees  legal fees  taxes  insurance  etc  the company  as the holder in most cases of the subordinate class  will suffer a loss 
the company believes that cash generated by current and future operations and additional capital raising activities  including borrowings  will enable the company to meet its current and anticipated future liquidity requirements  including the payment of dividends to its shareowners in an amount equal to at least of the company s reit income 
see forward looking information below 
the management and the board of directors of the company are continuing to evaluate its existing structure and strategy and consider whether changes are warranted 
the goal of management and the board of directors is to invest in assets with the greatest risk adjusted rates of return 
a change in the company s existing portfolio may impact the future reit income and resulting dividends of the company 
see forward looking information below 
cmbs bond yield considerations defaults the yields on the cmbs bonds acquired by the company are extremely sensitive to the amount and timing of defaults and the severity of losses on the mortgage loans collateralizing such cmbs bonds 
the company s right  as a holder of subordinate cmbs bonds  to distributions of principal and interest is subordinate to the more senior classes of cmbs bonds 
actual losses on the loans take place after default on the loan  when the proceeds from the foreclosure sale of the real estate are less than the unpaid balance of the mortgage loan plus interest advances and foreclosure costs 
such losses will be allocated first to the subordinate first loss cmbs bonds prior to being allocated to the more senior cmbs bond classes 
as of february   one of the mortgages with an outstanding balance of  that collateralizes two of the company s cmbs bonds was foreclosed and subsequently refinanced with a new property owner 
otherwise  there have been no delinquencies 
the cmbs bonds the company owns are more speculative than the senior cmbs bond classes and may be subject to special risks  including a substantially greater risk of loss of principal and non payment of interest 
if the cmbs bonds acquired by the company have an actual default rate and severity of loss on the mortgage collateral that are higher than those anticipated by the company when the bonds were acquired  their yield will be lower than the company initially anticipated and  in the event of substantial losses  the company may not recover its acquisition cost 
the timing of actual losses also will affect the company s yield on cmbs bonds  even if the rate of default and severity of loss are consistent with the company s projection 
in general  the earlier a loss occurs  the greater the adverse effect on the company s yield 
the company s yield on cmbs bonds also will be affected by interest rate levels during the periods in which the mortgage loans collateralizing the cmbs bonds mature 
for example  if at the maturity date of a mortgage loan  prevailing mortgage interest rates are much higher than the original interest rate on the mortgage loan  the operating cash flows from the commercial property may not be sufficient to meet the higher debt service costs of replacement financing  and the owner of the commercial property  unable to obtain replacement financing  may default on the mortgage 
if the property is not sold for more than the amount of the mortgage plus foreclosure costs  the company may incur credit losses 
similar losses may occur if financing of the commercial properties cannot be arranged at the maturity date of the current outstanding mortgage due to poor property performance 
these potential losses are referred to as balloon losses 
there can be no assurance as to the future rate of delinquency  severity of loss or the timing of any such losses on the mortgage loans collateralizing the cmbs bonds and  thus  no assurance as to the actual yield received by the company 
see forward looking information below 
prepayments the aggregate amount of distributions on the company s cmbs bonds and their yields also will be affected by the amount and timing of principal prepayments on the mortgage loans 
generally  all payments of principal  including prepayments  on the mortgage loans will be paid to the holders of any more senior classes of cmbs bonds before principal payments are paid to the subordinate bond classes held by the company 
because of this  when computing yields to maturity on its cmbs bonds  the company generally does not consider prepayments from the underlying mortgage loans collateralizing its cmbs bonds 
however  because the company is acquiring the cmbs bonds at a significant discount from their outstanding principal balance  prepayments of principal on the cmbs bonds the company owns  may increase the company s yield on its cmbs bonds 
because the rate and timing of principal payments on mortgage loans will depend on future events and on a variety of factors over which the company has no control  no assurances can be given as to the rate or timing of principal payments  if any  on the cmbs bonds the company owns 
see forward looking information below 
loss severity while the rate and timing of defaults and prepayments on the mortgage collateral are important in determining the anticipated yield on subordinate cmbs bonds  the anticipated severity of the loss on the mortgage loans ie  the total loss on any foreclosure sale as a percentage of the remaining outstanding principal balance of a mortgage loan is significantly more important in determining the anticipated yield on a subordinate cmbs bond 
losses on defaulted mortgage collateral are realized after the foreclosure sale of the property which generally is the only security for the mortgage loan 
the severity of these losses is extremely important because such losses generally will be allocated to  and will reduce the remaining principal balance of  the company s subordinate cmbs bonds 
the severity of loss takes into account the property owner s equity in the mortgaged real estate  the anticipated decline in market value of the property  accrued and unpaid interest through the foreclosure process and foreclosure costs 
the higher the coupon rate of the mortgage loan  the higher are the costs of interest advances from the date of default through foreclosure sale 
inflation  interest rates  mortgage prepayments and other factors the company and the common stock will be affected by prevailing market interest rates  including i the effects of interest rates on the values of long term  fixed rate debt securities  ii the possibility that  in periods of high interest rates  the common stock may be less attractive than alternative investments of equal or lower risk  iii possible mismatches between the company s borrowing costs and the company s cash flow requirements which could have a negative effect on the company s income  iv the negative effect of high interest rates on the properties underlying the company s cmbs bonds including a negative impact on the owner s ability to refinance debt secured by such properties  and v the effects of interest rates on the company s borrowing costs 
interest rates are determined in large part by market conditions and government policies which are beyond the control of the company and which are difficult to predict
