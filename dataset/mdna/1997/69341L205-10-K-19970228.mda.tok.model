failure to replace equipment may result in shorter lease terms and higher costs of maintaining and operating aged equipment  and  in certain instances  limited remarketability 
the company has syndicated investment programs from which it earns various fees and equity interests 
the professional lease management income fund i fund i was structured as a limited liability company with a no front end fee structure 
the previously syndicated limited partnership programs allowed the company to receive fees for the acquisition and initial lease of the equipment 
the fund i program does not provide for acquisition and lease negotiation fees 
the company invests the equity raised through syndication in transportation equipment which is then managed on behalf of the investors 
the equipment management activities for these types of programs generate equipment management fees for the company over the life of the program  typically to years 
the limited partnership agreements generally entitle the company to receive a or interest in the cash distributions and earnings of the partnership subject to certain allocation provisions 
the fund i agreement entitles the company to a interest in the cash distributions and earnings of the program subject to certain allocation provisions which will increase to after the investors have received distributions equal to their original invested capital 
on may   the company announced the suspension of public syndication of equipment leasing programs with the may  close of fund i 
as a result of this decision  revenues earned from managed programs which include management fees  partnership interests and other fees  and acquisition and lease negotiation fees will be reduced in the future as the older programs begin liquidation and the managed equipment portfolio becomes permanently reduced 
the company is engaged in the funding and management of longer term direct finance leases  operating leases  and loans through its afg subsidiary 
master lease agreements are entered into with predominately investment grade lessees and serve as the basis for marketing efforts 
the underlying assets represent a broad range of commercial and industrial equipment  such as data processing  communications  materials handling  and construction equipment

liquidity and capital resources cash requirements historically have been satisfied through cash flow from operations  borrowings  or sales of transportation equipment 
liquidity beyond will depend  in part  on continued remarketing of the equipment portfolio at similar lease rates  management of existing sponsored programs  effectiveness of cost control programs  possible additional equipment sales  and the volume of commercial and industrial equipment leasing transactions for which the company earns fees and a spread 
management believes the company can accomplish the preceding and will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources for the future 
specifically  future liquidity is influenced by the following a debt financing senior debt the company s million senior loan with a syndicate of insurance companies provides that equipment sale proceeds from pledged equipment or cash deposits be placed into collateral accounts or used to purchase additional equipment to the extent required to meet certain debt covenants

at december   a notional amount of million of interest rate swap agreements effectively fixed interest rates between and on such obligations 
interest expense was increased by  due to these arrangement in the notional amounts of the swaps do not represent amounts exchanged between the parties and  therefore  are not a measure of the company s exposure resulting from its use of the swaps

the remaining released collateral was used for general corporate purposes 
the funds were released based on the appraised fair market value of the equipment portfolio and the related collateral coverage ratio 
as of december   million was on deposit in the cash collateral account 
over the last four years  the company has downsized its transportation equipment portfolio through the sale or disposal of underperforming and nonperforming assets 
the company will continue to identify underperforming and nonperforming assets for sale or disposal as necessary 
c syndication activities on may   the company s board of directors approved the suspension of syndication of transportation equipment leasing programs effective with the may  close of its then current offering  professional lease management income fund i

the company earned fees from syndication activities related to egf vii during the first four months of total equity raised for this partnership was million through april   when the program closed 
there will be no more equity raised for this partnership 
d commercial and industrial equipment leasing activities the company earns finance lease or operating lease income for leases originated and retained by its afg subsidiary 
the funding of leases requires the company to retain an equity interest in all leases financed through the securitization facility 
afg also originates loans where it takes a security interest in the assets

trends the company continues to seek opportunities for new businesses  markets  and acquisitions 
during  the company established its afg subsidiary  and in entered into an agreement with equis financial group equis to obtain its lease origination and servicing operations  and the rights to manage a significant offshore investment program 
additionally  the agreement provided for afg to acquire software  computers and furniture that support the marketing and operations activities 
afg is engaged in the funding and management of longer term direct finance type leases  operating leases and loans 
master lease agreements are entered into with predominately investment grade lessees and serve as the basis for marketing efforts 
the underlying assets represent a broad range of commercial and industrial equipment  such as data processing  communications  materials handling  and construction equipment 
afg also is engaged in the management of an institutional leasing investment program for which it originates leases and receives acquisition and management fees 
during  afg originated million in leasing and loan transactions of which million was for the company s account 
this is an important new growth area for the company 
in the future  the company intends to continue to develop the portfolio of its afg subsidiary 
going forward  the company will also concentrate on expanding its current trailer leasing and management operations through its plm rental  inc subsidiary 
plm rental is currently the largest short term  on demand refrigerated trailer rental operation in north america  and the company believes there are new opportunities in the refrigerated and other trailer leasing markets 
during  the company announced the suspension of public syndication of equipment leasing programs with the may  close of fund i 
as a result of this decision  revenues earned from managed programs which include management fees  partnership interests and other fees  and acquisition and lease negotiation fees will be reduced in the future as the older programs begin liquidation and the managed equipment portfolio becomes permanently reduced 
the company has continued to selectively reduce the size of its owned transportation equipment portfolio over the past year 
in  the company sold million of which million was included in assets held for sale as of december   based on original cost  of its owned transportation equipment  and the company expects to continue to sell equipment in and beyond  as market conditions dictate it is appropriate 
as a result of the reduction in owned equipment  the company s operating lease revenues are expected to continue to decrease as well as the associated depreciation  operating  and repair and maintenance costs 
however  the company has used the proceeds from equipment sales and cash from operations to reduce senior and subordinated outstanding indebtedness by million over the last three years  resulting in reduced interest costs 
these reductions will help offset the increased borrowing activity associated with the expansion of the afg lease portfolio 
in addition  the reduction in transportation equipment lease revenue will be offset by increases in commercial and industrial equipment lease revenue generated by afg 
the company continues to benefit from cost reduction measures  principally reflecting reductions in total company staffing implemented during and  which are resulting in lower operations support and general and administrative expenses
