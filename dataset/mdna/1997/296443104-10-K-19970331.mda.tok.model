as a result  the frozen novelty category has shown declines from results according to iri 
these factors  along with a decrease in the rate of promotional spending by the company  as discussed in expenses and other income below  combined to negatively impact the company s sale of licensed and sublicensed products 
the sale of products under company owned brands decreased in as a result of the factors cited above and differences in the timing of customer shipments associated with eskimo pie brand products

the comparison between and is also impacted by the inclusion in of million of weight watchers finished goods which were acquired and sold by the company upon the execution of the licensing agreement 
the sale of sublicensed brand products increased in due to the inclusion of the weight watchers  realfruit and nabisco lines of products beginning in january  april and december  respectively 
flavors  packaging and other sales continue to grow with increases of and in and  respectively 
substantially all of this increase is the result of the successful sales efforts being undertaken to expand the flavors business beyond its traditional licensee base 
gross profit  as a percent of sales  declined to in and in primarily as a result of the change in product mix referred to above 
sublicensed brands  which accounted for of sales in as compared with in  return lower gross profit due primarily to the royalty costs associated with these brands

expenses and other income while advertising and sales promotion expense increased in and in due primarily to additional brand management costs and new product introductions  the actual amount allocated to each licensed brand and individual products within the brands has declined in recent years 
for example  excluding expenditures for the snackwell s and oreo products introduced in december  advertising and sales promotion expense would have approximated levels 
given the addition of four new eskimo pie brand items  two additional national sublicensed brands comprising different products among several product categories and the additional flavors business  the actual rate of spending has decreased

general and administrative expenses increased in to support the demands of the additional sublicensed brands acquired in as a percent of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in as a result of additional sales provided by the newly acquired sublicensed brands 
the loss on disposal of fixed assets reflects  in addition to minor recurring items  the disposal of certain equipment leased to one of the company s licensees 
the equipment has been dismantled and no alternative use is available

these special charges include accruals relating to the previously mentioned executive severance  the loss on disposal of fixed assets  and the disposal of licensee and company held inventories 
after related tax benefits  the special charges reduced net income by approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources the company s utilization of licensees allows it to operate with relatively low capital requirements 
this reduces the company s working capital requirements to that necessary to support its licensing strategy rather than the amounts required to support the manufacture of finished consumer goods 
working capital requirements generally precede the seasonal pattern of the company s sales 
the company believes that the cash generated from operations and funds available under its credit agreements provide the company with sufficient funds and the financial flexibility to support its ongoing business  strategic objectives and debt repayment requirements 
the company s principal customers are approximately licensees  each having specific geographic territories 
as a result of its national territorial licensing system  the top four and ten customers  respectively  account for approximately and of the company s net sales 
the company s licensing strategy allows it to select a stronger customer base which it can actively monitor to minimize the impact of an unforeseen loss of any such customer 
in addition  its licensing agreements generally provide for a six month transition period in the event of termination of any such agreement 
the loss of one or more of these major licensees could cause some disruption in the company s operations  although  based upon prior experience with replacing major licensees  management believes it could find a suitable replacement within a short period of time and  as a result  such customer loss would not have a significant impact on the company s operations  liquidity or capital resources

approximately  of additional tax benefits relating to estimated state tax payments and net operating losses can be recovered in as cash refunds of prior year tax payments 
during  the company s board of directors increased management s authorization to repurchase the company s common stock 
the additional  shares  when combined with previously approved authorizations  will allow the company to repurchase up to  shares or approximately of the then outstanding common stock 
pursuant to this renewed authorization  management repurchased  shares in at a cost of approximately  on march   the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 
per share  payable april   to shareholders of record on march  while the company anticipates a regular quarterly dividend  the amount and timing of any future dividends will depend on the general business conditions encountered by the company  as well as the financial condition  earnings and capital requirements of the company and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors
