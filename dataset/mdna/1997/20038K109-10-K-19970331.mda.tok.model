overview the october acquisition of comforce telecom marked the company s entry into the technical staffing business  followed by the acquisition of six additional technical staffing businesses through february following is a summary of these acquisitions  which are also discussed under acquisition history in item of this report fiscal year acquisition revenue current acquired company founded date millions offices headquarters market served comforce telecom october lake success  telecommunications ny williams march englewood  telecommunications fl rra may tempe  az technical services force five august dallas  tx information technology azatar november rochester  information technology ny continental november elmsford  ny telecommunications rho february redmond  technical services and wa information technology all acquisitions made by the company have been accounted for on a purchase basis and the results of operations of each of the businesses acquired have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the company s results of operations and financial condition reflect its rapid growth through acquisitions 
amortization of intangibles  principally goodwill  has also increased as a result of acquisitions 
the company has made and continues to make investments in connection with the purchase and integration of its acquired businesses in order to realize long term improvements in profitability  however  the costs of integration may have an adverse effect on short term operating results 
management believes that  as the company integrates its acquired businesses  the adverse effect of integration expenses on profitability are expected to decline as are operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 
however  to the extent that the company makes additional acquisitions in the future  there can be no assurance that the company s results of operations will not be adversely affected by integration costs

the company serves customers in three principal sectors telecommunications  information technology and technical services 
in the telecommunications sector  the company provides staffing for wireline and wireless communications systems development  satellite and earth station deployment  network management and plant modernization 
in the information technology sector  the company provides staffing for specific projects requiring highly specialized skills such as applications programming and development  client server development  systems software architecture and design  systems engineering and systems integration 
in the technical services sector  the company provides staffing for national laboratory research in such areas as environmental safety  alternative energy source development and laser technology  and provides highly skilled labor meeting diverse commercial needs in the avionics and aerospace  architectural  automotive  energy and power  pharmaceutical  marine and petrochemical fields 
gross margins on staffing services can vary significantly depending on factors such as the specific services being performed  the overall contract size and the amount of recruiting required 
margins on the company s sales in the technical services sector are typically significantly lower than those in the telecommunications and it sectors  although the trend in the it staffing sector has been toward lower gross margins generally as this sector matures and consolidates 
additionally  in certain markets the company has experienced significant pricing pressure from some of its competitors 
consequently  changes in the company s sales mix can be expected to impact the overall gross margins generated by the company 
staffing personnel placed by the company are company employees 
the company is responsible for employee related expenses for its employees  including workers compensation  unemployment compensation insurance  medicare and social security taxes and general payroll expenses 
the company offers health  dental  disability and life insurance to its billable employees 
the company s quarterly operating results are affected primarily by the number of billing days in the quarter and the seasonality of its customers businesses 
demand for services in the technical services sector has historically been lower during the year end holidays through january of the following year  showing gradual improvement over the remainder of the year 
although less pronounced than in technical services  the demand for services of the telecommunications and it sectors is typically lower during the first quarter until customers operating budgets are finalized 
the company believes that the effects of seasonality will be less severe in the future as revenues contributed by the information technology and telecommunications sectors continue to increase as a percentage of the company s consolidated revenues 
results of operations the historical financial information for the company presented under item of this report for december  and relates principally to the company s former jewelry operations which were discontinued september  this historical financial information includes limited results of the company s technical staffing operations  all of which  except for comforce telecom  were acquired since january  consequently  a discussion and comparison of the company s historical results of operations may not be meaningful 
in order to provide a discussion of results which may be more meaningful than the historical discussion  the company has i presented under item of this report unaudited pro forma data of the company for the years ended december  and assuming that the acquisition of comforce telecom which was acquired by the company in october and related financing and capital transactions had occurred as of january   and ii presented below a comparison of historical results of operations with pro forma results  and of pro forma results with pro forma results 
year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  revenues of million for the year ended december  were million  or higher than pro forma revenues for the year ended december  this increase in revenues is attributable to the acquisitions completed during and growth in the telecommunications and information technology sectors which were served by the company in and cost of revenues for the year ended december  was of revenues compared to pro forma cost of revenues of for the year ended december  the cost of revenues increase of is a result of the company s expansion into more mature technical staffing sectors 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased million or from the pro forma selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense is a result of the absence  in  of two nonrecurring charges that impacted pro forma selling  general and administrative expenses 
these charges included a stock compensation expense of million and management fees of million paid by comforce telecom to its former parent company prior to its acquisition by the company 
historical operating income for the year ended december  was million compared to a pro forma operating loss of million for the year ended december  the improvement of million was principally attributable to the discontinuance in the period of the non recurring charges of million recorded in the operating income was also impacted by acquisitions completed during the year and increased margins on revenue growth in the company s telecommunications and information technology sectors 
the income tax provision for the year ended december  was  on income of million compared with pro forma income taxes of  on pro forma loss before income taxes of million for the year ended december pro forma year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  pro forma revenues of million for the year ended december  were million or higher than pro forma revenues for the year ended december  the increase in pro forma revenues is attributable to growth in sectors serviced by the company telecommunications and information technology services 
pro forma cost of revenues for the year ended december  was of pro forma revenues compared to pro forma cost of revenues of for the year ended december  although the pro forma cost of revenues increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to increased revenues during  on a percentage basis  the pro forma cost of revenues decreased by as a result of a more favorable sales mix in pro forma selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million  over the pro forma selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  this increase was principally related to a non recurring stock compensation charge of million 
pro forma operating results for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by a non recurring charge of  related to management fees paid by comforce telecom to its former parent company prior to its acquisition by the company 
pro forma operating results for the year ended december  included a charge of million for management fees paid by comforce telecom to its former parent company prior to its acquisition by the company as well as a million charge related to non recurring stock compensation expense 
the net impact of these non recurring charges on the pro forma results was million as compared to  for pro forma operating loss for the year ended december  was million compared to a pro forma operating loss of million for the year ended december  the increase in operating loss of million was principally attributable to increased management fees and stock compensation charges of million recorded in as compared to  partially offset by increased margin contributions resulting from revenue growth experienced in pro forma other expense  principally net interest expense  for the year ended december  decreased million as compared to the year ended december  the decrease is principally due to the and discharge of indebtedness under terms of the bank loan agreements related to the company s discontinued jewelry operations 
as a result of the discontinuance of its jewelry operations  it has been determined that the company will be unable to utilize losses from those businesses in the future 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources during  the company s primary sources of funds to meet working capital needs were from operations and borrowings under the million chase credit facility 
in addition  in connection with the rho acquisition in february  the company entered into a short term credit facility with us bank of washington  national association the us bank credit facility  providing for up to million in availability for working capital purposes 
since the fourth quarter of  the company has funded its strategy of growth through acquisitions principally through private debt or equity financing  including its sale of million of convertible debentures in february and march see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in march  a portion of the proceeds from the debenture offering were used to retire the chase credit facility 
the company is presently seeking to obtain a credit facility providing for term loan and revolving credit availability of from million to million to fund additional acquisitions  to retire the us bank credit facility which matures in july and to finance working capital needs to replace the chase credit facility and the us bank credit facility 
in respect of its working capital requirements  the company typically pays its billable employees weekly for their services before receiving payment from its customers 
as new offices are established or acquired  or as existing offices expand and revenues are increased  there will be greater requirements for cash resources to fund current operations 
management believes that such a replacement credit facility will be sufficient to meet its anticipated level of business activity in however  the company can give no assurance that such a credit facility will be available or  if available  that it will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
although management believes that the funds provided by operations  the us bank credit facility and funds remaining under the million debt placement will be sufficient to meet its present working capital requirements through july  the company s inability to obtain a new credit facility could require the company to delay  scale back or eliminate all or some of its market development and acquisition projects and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is obligated under various acquisition agreements to make earn out payments to the sellers of acquired companies  subject to the acquired companies achieving specified earnings targets 
the maximum amount of these potential earn out payments is  in cash payable in and million in cash and million in stock payable in the three year period from to the company cannot currently estimate whether it will be obligated to pay the maximum amount  however  the company anticipates that the cash generated by the operations of the acquired companies will provide all or a substantial part of the capital required to fund the cash portion of the earn out payments 
cash and cash equivalents increased million during cash flows of million provided by financing activities exceeded cash flows of million used in operating activities and cash flows of million used by investing activities 
cash flows used by operating activities were principally attributable to temporary need to fund williams  rra  force five  azatar and continental accounts receivable and their carrying costs due to the purchase of williams in march  rra in may  force five in august effective july   azatar in november  and continental in november cash flows used in investing activities are principally related to the purchase of williams  rra  force five  azatar and continental for a total of million  including directly related costs  as well as loans made to certain officers of the company pursuant to their employment contracts in the amount of  and the purchase of fixed assets in the amount of  cash flows from financing activities were attributable to net borrowings under the chase credit facility of million  the exercise of warrants in the amount of million  the issuance of series d  e and f preferred stock in the amount of million  million and million  respectively  and the proceeds from the sale of common stock and associated payment rights of million  partially offset by dividend payments of  repayments on notes of  and registration costs of  in the technical staffing industry  administrative  accounting and other back office operations are often provided on a centralized basis 
the company believes that its management information systems responsible for these functions are capable of supporting additional levels of business in the future at low incremental costs 
the company currently intends to integrate the administrative functions of its recent and future acquisitions into the systems of previously acquired companies to seek to improve operating efficiencies 
during the year ended december   the company eliminated its working capital deficiency and  at december   had excess working capital of million 
the increase in working capital is principally attributable to the company s increase in accounts receivable due to the acquisition of williams  rra  force five  azatar and continental and the reduction in the liabilities assumed by artra 
as of december   approximately million  or of the company s total assets were intangible assets  which will increase substantially with the inclusion of rho s assets 
these intangible assets substantially represent amounts attributable to goodwill recorded in connection with the company s acquisitions and will be amortized over a five to forty year period  resulting in an annual charge of in excess of million with the inclusion of rho 
various factors could impact the company s ability to generate the earnings necessary to support this amortization schedule  including fluctuations in the economy  the degree and nature of competition  demand for the company s services  and the company s ability to integrate the operations of acquired businesses  to recruit and place staffing professionals  to expand into new markets and to maintain gross margins in the face of pricing pressures 
the failure of the company to generate earnings necessary to support the amortization charge may result in an impairment of the asset 
the resulting write off could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
other matters on january  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  which requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is evaluated by comparing future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the use or sale of the asset and its eventual disposition  to the carrying amount of the asset 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  in as permitted by sfas  the company continues to measure compensation cost in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  but provides pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method as defined in sfas had been applied beginning in the company does not believe that its adoption of either sfas or sfas will have a material impact on its financial statements and the company will comply with the related disclosure requirements
