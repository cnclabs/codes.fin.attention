overview vlsi the company reported net revenues in at approximately net revenue levels despite a significant drop in its personal computer pc chip business 
vlsi s pc chip business declined from approximately of net revenues to approximately of net revenues due to increased competition from intel corporation for core logic chip sets and reduced sales of apple computer related chips 
revenue growth in the communications  consumer digital entertainment and advanced computing businesses largely offset declines in the pc business 
the rapid decline of vlsi s personal computer business resulted in unabsorbed costs associated with significant under utilization of internal manufacturing capacity and inventory charges taken for personal computer devices in vlsi took several measures to address the capacity problem during the year it reduced internal wafer fabrication at its san jose fabrication facility  it cut back on the use of subcontract wafer fabrication  it marketed its excess capacity to potential foundry customers  and it explored interest on the part of outside buyers or investors in the facility 
although these measures provided some relief  the underlying excess capacity issue was not resolved satisfactorily 
in the fourth quarter of  after failed attempts to deal with the under utilization  vlsi announced a plan to close its san jose  california fabrication facility by the end of and recorded million of special charges 
the million of special charges was the most significant factor contributing to the company s reported net loss of million in on million of net revenues compared to net income of million on net revenues of million in and net income of million on net revenues of million in while gross profit margins had improved sequentially over the three years through  excess capacity and essentially flat net revenues in resulting from the decline in the company s personal computer business depressed gross profit margins 
results of operations the company derives its net revenues primarily from sales of integrated circuits ics in three primary markets computing  communications and consumer digital entertainment 
the company s subsidiary  compass design automation  inc compass  provides software and design libraries to the electronic design automation eda market  which are intended to allow systems and chip designers to automate and standardize the integrated circuit design process 
thousands net revenues    percentage increase decrease over preceding year less than 
net revenues from the pc market fell substantially in after intel s expansion into the core logic chip set business caused vlsi to lose market share in the x market 
chip sales for apple architecture systems also decreased in pc market net revenues in had increased due to higher units shipped for incorporation into apple products  partially offset by decreased unit sales of x chip sets 
net revenues in from the pc market expanded due to higher average sales prices resulting from the introduction of new products targeted at portable and pentium compatible pc s 
vlsi reported net revenues in that were down slightly from levels as strong demand for products designed for communications  consumer digital entertainment and advanced computing devices nearly offset declines in net revenues for products sold to the pc market 
in  net revenues from communications markets grew considerably over reflecting increased units shipped year on year 
in  net revenues from the communications market increased as units shipped in that market during approximately doubled from similarly  a major portion of the company s net revenue growth was due to an increase in the number of units shipped for communications devices 
net revenues from consumer digital entertainment products grew in for the third consecutive year reflecting continued increases of unit shipments for this market 
the increase in net revenues is due to new business in the video arcade arena and to increased demand for set top boxes for satellite and cable tv products 
during each of the years  and  a different customer has exceeded of net revenues 
in that customer was in the communications market and in and the customers were in the personal computer business 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
compass net revenues from the eda market in declined from levels after had increased from levels 
the decline in reflects compass difficulties developing new products  increased competition and consolidation among eda providers 
results from operations in were not satisfactory and management is considering strategic alternatives to deal with these issues 
international net revenues including export sales decreased in as a substantial portion of exports in prior years had been for devices for the pc market in the asia pacific region 
international net revenues were approximately of net revenues  down from approximately of net revenues in and european net revenues increased in over after a increase in over and a slight increase in over the growth in european net revenues reflects the location of the major customers for vlsi s communications devices and the success of gsm as the leading digital wireless standard in europe 
increased sales of consumer digital entertainment devices into both europe and japan in over partially offset the decline in asia pacific net revenues 
thousands gross profits    percentage of net revenues gross profits as a percentage of net revenues in remained relatively flat with levels after improving to in and in the decrease in the company s x based revenue led to under utilization at the company s san jose facility  inventory charges taken during the first quarter of for personal computer devices  as well as certain manufacturing inefficiencies as a result of the change in the business 
in response to the loss of a substantial portion of its x business  the company instituted a reduction in force in march in both the san jose fabrication facility and in the company s tempe  arizona test facility 
costs associated with the under utilization of the san jose fabrication facility during and expenses relating to the reduction in force and inventory charges for certain x devices negatively affected gross profit margins in see the discussion of special charges below 
the gross profit margin improvement from to reflected the implementation of new process technologies that enabled smaller device geometries  lower assembly costs  improved yields and improved product mix 
improvements made in manufacturing efficiencies and yields that led to lower costs were masked in by costs associated with under utilization of wafer fab capacity 
the gross profit margin was also adversely affected by certain manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the conversion of the san jose  california facility to a inch cmos wafer process and the transition of the san antonio  texas facility to micron and smaller geometry cmos processes 
for further discussion of factors affecting gross profit margins  see factors affecting future results 
thousands operating expenses excluding special charges    percentage of net revenues excluding special charges operating expenses excluding special charges were approximately of net revenues in and approximately and of net revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues in reflects the lack of revenue growth during a period of increasing r d investment for new products and increases in marketing  general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues in reflects decreases in both marketing  general and administrative expenses and r d expenses as a percentage of net revenues 
while net revenues in were essentially flat to  the company continued to increase spending in r d 
increased r d expenses in each of the last three years reflect the continuing investment in new products  design development  and package and process technologies 
in and  new product development emphasized the communications and consumer digital entertainment markets 
r d expenses in focused on the development of new process technologies in smaller geometries and new devices for the communications and consumer digital entertainment markets  as well as the development of software for the eda market 
included in r d expenses is approximately million for a reduction in force of the compass engineering organization  which occurred in the third quarter of marketing  general and administrative expenses have increased in amount each year from to these expenses grew faster than net revenues in  while in and they decreased as a percentage of net revenues 
the increase in expenses reflects the company s investment supporting the transition in from pc to consumer markets 
special charges the special charges of million primarily reflect the company s decision in the fourth quarter to close its san jose  california wafer fabrication facility 
the company s decision to shift to its newer markets late in combined with the loss of the x core logic business early in substantially reduced the demand for the san jose facility s capacity 
the decision to close this facility  made in the fourth quarter of  came only after vlsi had unsuccessfully attempted to increase facility utilization by marketing the plant as a foundry and by searching for potential buyers or investors 
vlsi expects to close the facility by the end of after working to accommodate its customers whose products have been manufactured exclusively in the san jose facility 
in addition to writing down assets by million  the company has recorded obligations totaling million to make future disbursements for items such as employee severance costs and losses associated with sales commitments and customer accommodations 
these payments  which are expected to occur throughout  will be made from currently available cash  cash equivalents and liquid investments and from cash flows expected to be generated in approximately employees  primarily direct labor classifications  working in the san jose facility are expected to be terminated when the plant closes in the latter part of the special charges also include costs associated with a change in estimate for settling lease terminations previously accrued in the company s special charge and adjustments of the net book value of excess assets acquired to expand the san antonio wafer fabrication facility 
the company has estimated the costs associated with the decision to close the san jose facility and these other matters 
although the company believes its estimates to be reasonable  actual costs associated with these plans may differ materially 
in particular  the costs associated with estimating losses on sales commitments and accommodating customers are difficult to ascertain 
therefore  the company may  in future periods  need to change its estimated costs associated with the special charges as more information becomes available 
customer products that can currently only be manufactured in the san jose facility generated approximately million of net revenues throughout  inclusive of products manufactured early in on which vlsi experienced reduced demand later in the year 
vlsi must determine whether to pursue alternative manufacturing arrangements in order to continue supplying these products to its customers 
the company estimates costs to operate the san jose facility in will approximate million  which costs should be removed from cost of sales in future years once the facility closure is complete

impact of changes in values of foreign currencies impact of inflation net revenues and cost of sales of foreign subsidiaries are primarily us dollar based 
operating expenditures of foreign subsidiaries are based in local currency 
as a result  fluctuations in currency rates have historically affected operating expenses 
although the us dollar has fluctuated against the japanese yen and major european currencies in the last three years  the company has been able to maintain an approximately offsetting balance between the remaining local currency based net revenues and operating expenses 
in periods where there may be a negative impact on operating expenses  the company generally has offsetting favorable currency related results on net revenues 
conversely  when net revenues are negatively impacted  there are generally offsetting favorable impacts on operating expense 
these offsetting tendencies result in currency fluctuations having an immaterial net effect on the operations of the company over the last three years 
the company anticipates the difference between foreign currency net revenues and foreign currency operating expenses could become material in  particularly with respect to the japanese yen and possibly certain european currencies 
the company has begun a program of entering into foreign currency hedges in an attempt to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on the results of operations 
there can be no assurance that such hedging activity will be successful in eliminating the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on results of operations 
during  the company changed the functional currency of the majority of its larger european foreign subsidiaries from the local subsidiary currency to us dollar based currency  reflecting the significance of predominantly us dollar based net revenues and cost of sales 
prior to  the company had designated the local subsidiary currency as the functional currency of each of its foreign subsidiaries 
there was no material effect on the consolidated financial statements from this change 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its consolidated financial statements accurately reflect the impact that inflation has  if any  on the results of operations of the company and considers such impact to be immaterial for all periods presented 
patent matters during the third quarter of  in response to a claim by ibm of infringement by vlsi  the company concluded a patent licensing agreement with ibm 
as a result of that agreement  the company recorded a charge against earnings of million for the release of alleged infringement claims incurred prior to the company will also pay an on going royalty through the five year term of the agreement in amounts not considered material to the results of any one quarter 
the company recorded a charge of million in the second quarter of associated with claims on patent matters by ti 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense and other  net interest expense in is higher reflecting a full year of interest expense associated with the convertible subordinated notes the notes 
net interest income in reflects the impact of increased cash balances derived from the june public offering of common stock and september offering of the notes 
as those proceeds have been used to fund expansion of the company s manufacturing facilities since the second half of  cash balances  and therefore interest income  have declined as expected in also  during periods of significant capital expansion  total interest expense is reduced through higher levels of interest capitalization 
as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  the company s capital expenditures have been financed through cash 
this use of cash will result in reduced interest income in further  as capital additions activity is estimated to be lower in given recent equipment additions placed into service  capitalized interest is expected to decline in the company incurred immaterial foreign exchange gains and losses in  and provision for taxes on income the company s tax benefit of of pre tax loss reflects u 
s 
federal and state tax benefits of the company s loss and the utilization of foreign net operating loss carryforwards offset by other individually immaterial items 
the tax provision of of pre tax income reflects the impact of foreign income taxes in excess of us rates offset by state tax benefits and changes in the tax valuation reserve 
the tax provision of of pre tax income reflects benefits from prior year credit carryforwards and changes in the tax valuation reserve 
the company estimates that its overall effective tax rate will approximate in  however  the and future tax rates may vary depending on the company s overall operating results  the mix of income among tax jurisdictions and the company s ability to use the tax carryforward benefits 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient us taxable income in the future 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas with the commencement of fiscal initial adoption of fas did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company also adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas during this pronouncement requires quantification of stock compensation arrangements for shares granted under certain stock option plans defined in fas and disclosure of the earnings per share effect of these plans 
fas allows companies to elect either only to disclose the quantification of the effect of stock options or to actually record the effect in the consolidated financial statements 
since parameters required under fas to quantify stock compensation expense are subjective  the company has elected to continue accounting for stock compensation under the guidelines of the pre existing and continued acceptable accounting requirements and provides the pro forma footnote disclosures required by fas see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting future results as described by the following factors  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
during each of the years  and  vlsi s top customers represented approximately two thirds of the company s net revenues 
as a result of the concentration of the company s customer base  loss or cancellation of business from any of these customers  significant changes in scheduled deliveries to any of these customers or decreases in the prices of products sold to any of these customers could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
due to the decline in the company s x chip set business  the company has experienced a shift in its top customers in away from the high concentration of personal computer industry companies that was seen in to more customers in the communications and consumer digital entertainment markets 
in late  apple  a customer that accounted for more than of net revenues  announced delays to certain of its products in development as well as excessive amounts of inventories 
this resulted in lower than expected vlsi net revenues from apple in the fourth quarter of  which has continued throughout in addition  apple has instituted a policy of using numerous logic suppliers for the majority of its products that contain vlsi devices  effectively decreasing the company s share of apple s requirements for ics 
given the uncertainty regarding these factors  there can be no assurance as to the effect of apple s business on vlsi s future results of operations 
the company sells its products under terms and conditions customarily found in the semiconductor industry 
sales of these products are subject to customer cancellation with limited advance notice prior to shipment 
the company is a sole source of products to many of its customers  which may cause some customers to potentially over order vlsi products 
this could lead to cancellations of certain of those orders by customers when customers perceive that demand and supply are better aligned 
due to the company s relatively narrow customer base for certain devices and the short product life cycles of such products  the company could be left with significant inventory exposure  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
software net revenues  primarily through compass  are subject to various factors  including pricing pressure  customers capital budget approval cycles and limited backlog  which create a high degree of variability from quarter to quarter 
due to the high gross profit margin content of software net revenues and the size of certain transactions  such variability can lead to unpredictability of financial and operating results of the company for any given period 
for example  software net revenues in the fourth quarters of and were lower than net revenues in the third quarters of and  respectively 
in both cases  the fourth quarter net revenues were lower than expected  adversely affecting vlsi s overall results of operations 
results from operations were not satisfactory and management is considering strategic alternatives to dealing with these issues 
until such issues are resolved  compass may continue to have a negative impact on vlsi s results of operations 
the semiconductor industry has a history of cyclicality and is characterized by short product life cycles  continuous evolution of process technology  high fixed costs  additions of manufacturing capacity in large increments and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
these product supply and demand fluctuations have historically been characterized by periods of manufacturing capacity shortages immediately followed by periods of overcapacity  which are caused by the previously mentioned additions of manufacturing capacity in large increments 
the industry has moved from a period of capacity shortages in to what appears to be a period of excess capacity during and the immediate future 
due to the industry wide manufacturing capacity shortage experienced during  the company accelerated the expansion and upgrading of its manufacturing capacity with investment in capacity additions during amounting to approximately million 
any significant expansion or upgrade of semiconductor manufacturing capacity has attendant risks  and in and  inefficiencies caused by the work associated with the modifications of the manufacturing facilities had a negative effect on the company s overall gross profit 
during a period of industry overcapacity  profitability can drop sharply as utilization drops and high fixed costs of operating a wafer fabrication facility are spread over a lower net revenue base 
this risk has now increased due to the fact that the company has shifted an even greater percentage of its manufacturing to its own facilities in  vlsi produced approximately of its wafer requirements internally versus approximately of its wafer requirements internally 
in december  the company announced its intention to close its san jose wafer manufacturing facility 
the closure of the facility is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including uncertainty as to the exact timing  cost and effects of the proposed shutdown of the facility  loss of business from the company s customers whose devices are currently manufactured at the san jose plant and who choose to substitute products from other manufacturers  unanticipated employee costs relating to the shutdown  inability to retain employees during the phase out period  success in implementing cost reduction programs  and lower factory utilization and excess capacity 
while the company operates and maintains its own wafer manufacturing facilities  the company relies on three suppliers for the bulk of its assembly and test operations 
assembly and test allocations depend on vlsi s needs  supply availability during periods of capacity shortages and excesses and pricing 
any reduction in allocation from these suppliers could adversely affect the company s operations 
the company s products are susceptible to severe pricing pressures and the company continually attempts to pursue cost reductions  including process enhancements  in order to maintain acceptable gross profit margins 
future gross profit margins will also vary with the general condition of the economy  capacity utilization levels in the semiconductor industry  customer acceptance of new technologies and products  product functionality and capabilities  shifts in product mix  manufacturing yields and the effect of ongoing manufacturing cost reduction activities 
the company s compass subsidiary  like other companies in the electronic design automation business  is particularly subject to significant fluctuations in net revenues due to limited backlog and its reliance on large orders placed late in quarters 
the company s future success depends on its ability to continue to develop and introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and that satisfy customer requirements 
the company expects to continue to selectively invest in the research and development of new products 
new product development often requires long term forecasting of markets  market trends  development and implementation of new processes and technologies and substantial capital commitments 
if the company is unable to design  develop  manufacture and market new products successfully and in a timely manner  its operating results could be adversely affected 
no assurance can be given that the company s product and process development efforts will be successful  that new product introductions will achieve market acceptance or that the markets in question will develop 
management believes that the future success of vlsi will depend in part on its ability to attract and retain qualified employees  including management and technical and design personnel 
in particular  the company currently has numerous open positions  specifically in the engineering arena 
any lengthy delays in filling these positions will lead to delays in the introduction of various products currently being developed  as well as the research and development associated with potential new products 
the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing process 
increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing operations 
the company s san jose and san antonio facilities are located near residential areas  which could increase the incidence of environmental complaints or investigations 
there can be no assurance that changes in environmental regulations will not impose the need for additional capital equipment or other requirements 
any failure by the company to control the use of  or adequately to restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject it to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company s san jose facility  which includes manufacturing  compass  corporate support services such as its computer center  technology development  a primary shipping location and a major design center  is located near earthquake faults 
should an earthquake cause an interruption in operations  operating results could be materially adversely affected 
periodically  the company is made aware that technology used by the company in the manufacture of some or all of its products may infringe on product or process technology rights held by others 
resolution of whether the company s manufacture of products has infringed on valid rights held by others could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  and may require material changes in production processes and products 
several companies  including motorola and ibm  have individually contacted the company concerning its alleged use of intellectual property belonging to them 
during the third quarter of  in response to a claim by ibm of infringement by vlsi  the company concluded a patent licensing agreement with ibm 
as a result of that agreement  the company recorded a charge against earnings of million for the release of alleged infringement claims incurred prior to the company will also pay an on going royalty through the five year term of the agreement in amounts not considered material to the results of any one quarter 
vlsi has entered into licensing agreements and technology exchange agreements with various strategic partners and other third parties in order to allow vlsi access to third party technology  or to allow third parties access to vlsi s technology 
the company is unable to predict whether license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to the company or the magnitude of the costs associated with such terms 
failure to obtain or renew such licenses could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company continually evaluates the adequacy of its reserve for asserted and unasserted patent matters 
there are many semiconductor companies substantially larger than vlsi that have product and process technology rights that vlsi may have infringed 
the reserve for patent matters is based on the best available information at that time and it is reasonably possible that the company s estimate of the exposure for patent matters could materially change in the near term 
ti filed a lawsuit in claiming process patent infringement by the company of now expired us patents 
in may  a jury found against the company in the amount of million 
although contesting the jury verdict  the company recorded a charge to earnings of million in the second quarter of the trial judge subsequently set aside the jury verdict and ti appealed 
in july  the court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the trial judge s order 
ti has appealed the ruling to the us supreme court 
in the event that ti is successful on the appeal  there can be no assurance that the amount of the reserve will be sufficient if the supreme court were to award enhanced damages which by statute may be as high as treble damages  pre judgment interest and or attorneys fees 
there can be no assurance that ti will not prevail on its appeal or that  should ti ultimately lose on its appeal  there would be no other claims asserted by ti against vlsi for patent infringement 
liquidity and capital resources vlsi generates cash from operations  debt and equipment financings and sales of its securities 
principal uses of cash include purchases of capital equipment needed for semiconductor manufacturing and engineering and payments of debt and lease obligations 
thousands cash  cash equivalents and liquid investments    working capital    stockholders equity    at december   total cash  cash equivalents and liquid investments decreased million from year end due primarily to the ongoing capital expansion of the company s san antonio fabrication facilities and the repurchase of common stock 
during  total cash  cash equivalents and liquid investments increased million from year end due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from an equity offering late in the second quarter of  proceeds from a convertible debt offering in september  proceeds from the exercise by intel in august of its warrant to purchase vlsi common stock  and net income  offset by purchases of property  plant and equipment and payments of debt and capital leases during working capital decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  during  the company generated million of cash from operations  a increase over the million of cash generated from operations for and a increase over the million of cash generated from operations for accounts receivable decreased million in while having increased million in and million in inventory levels decreased million in  reflecting product mix changes from computer to communications and consumer products  whereas inventory had increased million in  reflecting a build up of custom products primarily for the communications markets 
inventory levels in decreased million due to inventory accumulated at year end in anticipation of demand for pc products in early accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred income decreased million in due to less volume with outside wafer suppliers and assembly and test operations 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities contributed approximately million to cash from operations in  reflecting increased spending levels associated with increases in production volumes and the stock tax benefit associated with the exercise of stock options by employees and the exercise by intel of its warrant 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased in by million reflecting increases in production volumes and the timing of payments for higher levels of spending for fixed assets  as well as increases in accrued compensation and benefits and other liabilities 
the effect of deferred and refundable income taxes on cash generated by operations was unusually high in due to the special charges recorded in the fourth quarter of cash used for investing activities was million for  as compared to million for and million for vlsi invested million in property  plant and equipment during compared to million in and million in capital additions during  and were financed by cash  equipment loans or capital leases 
the and investments in property  plant and equipment focused on facilitization and equipment for modules c and d of the san antonio facility 
investments during each of the three years through also included acquisition of equipment for sub micron wafer fabrication  upgrades to manufacturing and office facilities and computers and software to support research and development activity 
the expansion into the additional san antonio modules was initiated during in response to capacity constraints affecting the semiconductor industry and vlsi 
as part of the capital purchases  vlsi acquired land and buildings at its san jose headquarters for approximately million 
as part of capital purchases  vlsi acquired the land and buildings associated with the wafer fabrication and test areas at its san jose headquarters for approximately million 
in each of the years through  the company has expanded office facilities for its growing engineering and support space requirements 
the company expects current facilities will be adequate through cash used for financing activities was million in compared to cash provided from financing activities of million in and cash used for financing activities of million in the source of cash in as opposed to uses of cash in and reflects proceeds from the issuance of the company s securities in  including the company s june equity offering million shares for net proceeds to the company of approximately million  the august exercise by intel of a warrant for million shares approximately million and a september debt offering of million of convertible subordinated notes due for net proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  the company completed the conversion of its million convertible subordinated debentures into common shares in august see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  the board of directors of the company board authorized the company to repurchase shares of the company s common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the board authorized the company to re issue those shares at a later date through certain of its employee stock plans and or to fund stock or asset acquisitions authorized by the board 
during  the company repurchased million shares at an average per share price of and re issued million of these shares as part of employee stock option and stock purchase plan activities 
share repurchase activity in through february  totaled  shares at an average per share price of 
the company may  from time to time  continue to repurchase additional shares 
thousands capital expenditures    vlsi currently estimates that total budgeted capital expenditures for will approximate million and will include expenditures for equipment upgrades and for micron wafer fabrication capability 
as vlsi pursues these large projects in increasingly complex technologies  more time is needed to bring manufacturing capabilities on line 
accordingly  vlsi will continue to capitalize interest on these capital projects 
of such planned capital expenditures  the level of which could change as necessary during the year  vlsi had outstanding commitments for purchases of equipment of approximately million at december  vlsi believes that its existing cash balances and estimated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its liquidity and capital expenditure needs through while the company believes that its current capital resources are sufficient to meet its near term needs  in order to meet its longer term needs  vlsi continues to investigate the possibility of generating financial resources through technology or manufacturing partnerships  additional equipment financings and offerings of debt or equity securities
