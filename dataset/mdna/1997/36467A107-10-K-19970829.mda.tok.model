item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations paul son provides gaming equipment and supplies to new casinos and consumable products to its existing customer base 
the principal consumable products have limited useful lives  ranging from several hours in the case of playing cards and dice to several months in the case of table game layouts and several years in the case of casino chips and gaming furniture 
core business revenues are generated by sales of these products to the over of the casinos in the united states with which the company has an established relationship and comprise the majority of the company s total revenues 
complementing this core business is the significant additional revenue the company realizes when providing a full range of products to new casinos 
the company strives to become a casino s sole supplier of table game equipment and supplies 
during the past decade  casino entities have expanded from land based resort properties to riverboats  both cruising and dockside  and to native american lands 
as a licensed supplier  the company has vigorously pursued table gaming opportunities in emerging gaming jurisdictions 
because of the company s production capacity and its experience in the gaming supply industry  management believes the company is well positioned to capitalize on the combined growth of the gaming industry both domestically and internationally 
while the gaming industry has grown in recent years  the growth rate of table games has not matched that of the gaming industry as a whole 
this trend is attributed to an increasing allocation of total casino gaming space to slot machines which  in certain cases  may reduce the allocation of total casino gaming space to table games 
the number of new table games in new jurisdictions typically follow this trend after a period of operation 
however  new table games continue to be introduced in an effort to offset this trend and create exciting and progressive games in the table game segment 
results of operations the following table summarizes selected items from the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended may  revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest expense net income loss bad debt expense accounted for  and of selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended may   and  respectively 
the following table details the company s historical revenues by product line years ended may  revenues in thousands casino chips    table layouts    playing cards    gaming furniture    dice    table accessories and other products    total    comparison of operations for the years ended may  and may  revenues 
for the fiscal year ended may   paul son s revenues reached a record total of million 
this revenue figure represented a million  or  increase from the million in revenues which the company generated the previous year 
the increase in revenues resulted principally from an increase in new casino openings during the year 
in fiscal year  the company sold products totaling million to new casinos including riverboats  land based properties and native american casinos versus million to new casinos in the previous fiscal year 
the increase in new casino revenues was offset by a decrease in core sales 
core sales in fiscal were million  a decrease of million or from core sales of million in fiscal core sales  which are sales of consumable gaming supplies and equipment to the company s existing customer base  decreased during the year primarily due to a decrease in playing card sales  both paper and plastic 
playing card sales were down due to a number of factors including a change in the company s supplier of plastic playing cards during the second quarter of the fiscal year and the slowdown in shipments to many of the company s contract playing card customers who had a temporary over supply of playing cards during the first quarter of the fiscal year 
in addition  during fiscal  the company restructured its playing card sales force  developed an improved playing card product and relocated a portion of its playing card production to san luis  mexico  resulting in a temporary slowdown in playing card sales efforts 
management believes the changes implemented will result in greater sales coverage in all geographic areas  an improved product and more competitive pricing 
as a result of these changes  the company experienced an increase of in paper playing card sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal over the average of the sales generated in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
to a lesser extent  the company s core sales were affected by a decline in the sales of table accessories  which are generally acquired from third party manufacturers  who have been selling directly to casino customers in competition with the company 
as a result the company began manufacturing its own line of plastic dealing shoes in may in connection with the increase in new casino openings  sales of casino chips  table layouts  and dice increased   and  respectively  while  as a result of the decrease in core sales  playing cards  gaming furniture  and table accessories and other products decreased  and  respectively  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues  as a percentage of sales  decreased to for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
this percentage decrease was due to a number of factors including higher sales volume and corresponding higher operating efficiencies ie increased sales resulting in a higher number of units produced over the same fixed production costs  although the corresponding higher efficiencies achieved were partially offset by a temporary increase in fixed production costs resulting from the relocation of a portion of the company s playing card production to san luis  mexico 
also contributing to the decrease in the company s cost of revenues percentage was a change in product mix sold during the year 
chip sales  for which the company generates the highest gross margin  were million  versus million in the prior fiscal year 
during several of its most recent reporting periods  the company has generally had a positive impact from the decrease in the value of the mexican peso 
during the fiscal year ended may  the value of the mexican peso remained relatively stable 
the company cannot predict what impact fluctuations will have on future costs of the company s products manufactured in mexico

net income 
for the year ended may   the company had record net income of million  an increase of million over the net income of  in the prior fiscal year

cost of revenues as a percentage of sales remained almost constant at as compared to in fiscal although the cost of revenues percentage remained almost constant in fiscal  there were several factors which impacted cost of revenues both positively and negatively during the year 
negative factors included lower sales volume and the corresponding lower number of units produced  resulting in lower operating efficiencies and higher per unit fixed production costs  and increases in raw material costs and purchase prices paid for distributed items 
positive factors included a devaluation of the mexican peso by approximately during the year and a decrease in las vegas production support staff following the relocation of the remainder of the layout production operations to mexico during the year

liquidity and capital resources overview 
management believes that the combination of cash on hand  cash flows from operations and the company s existing line of credit will provide sufficient liquidity  both on a short term and long term basis 
working capital 
working capital totaled million at may   versus million at may  working capital increased during the year primarily due to the company s net income before depreciation of million  which was partially offset by the company s investment of  in property  plant and equipment during the year 
cash flow 
operating activities provided million in cash during the fiscal year ended may  compared to cash provided of million during the prior year 
net income before depreciation and income taxes of million was the major factor contributing to the cash provided by operations 
other significant sources of cash during the year included the proceeds generated from the sale of a building  and proceeds from the issuance of common stock  attributable to the exercise of  stock options during the fiscal year 
significant uses of cash included the purchase of property  plant and equipment  and reduction in long term debt 
total cash and cash equivalents increased by million during the year as compared to a total reduction in cash of  in the prior fiscal year 
line of credit 
the company maintains a line of credit the line of credit  with wells fargo bank of nevada wells fargo which presently allows the company to borrow up to  the line of credit matures on january  as of may   no advances were outstanding and the total amount of the line of credit was available 
the line of credit is collateralized by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the company s depository accounts at wells fargo  accounts receivable  inventory  furniture  fixtures and equipment  and bears interest at a variable rate of over wells fargo s prime lending rate 
under the line of credit  the company has agreed to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios 
specifically  the company has agreed to maintain a current ratio current assets to current liabilities of not less than to  a debt to worth ratio total liabilities divided by stockholders equity of less than to and a fixed charge coverage ratio earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization divided by prior period current maturities of long term debt plus interest plus rent of at least to pay off of secured debt 
in december  the company obtained a  loan for capital expenditures and working capital purposes the note from a financial institution 
the note which bore interest at per annum  with monthly payments of principal and interest totaling  was paid off in february the note was secured by a deed of trust on the old las vegas facility 
seasonality 
the company has traditionally experienced some seasonality  as new casino openings  particularly in las vegas  have tended to occur near the end of a calendar year typically during the company s second fiscal quarter 
there does not appear to be any seasonality associated with the company s core sales to existing customers 
backlog 
open orders as of may  totaled million  compared to million as of may  management believes that substantially all of these orders will be filled within the next six months  with the majority filled within the first fiscal quarter 
las vegas facilities 
in may of  the company relocated its corporate headquarters to the new las vegas facility 
the new las vegas facility was purchased in september for  and since september  the company has made improvements totaling approximately  in february  the company sold one of the buildings approximately  square feet which was a component of the old las vegas facility for  resulting in the reduction in the square footage at the old las vegas facility from  to  and repayment of the company s debt in the original principal amount of  which was secured by a deed of trust on the old las vegas facility 
the remaining components of the old las vegas facility are listed for sale 
san luis facilities 
in january  the company installed a second playing card production line in the san luis facilities 
the use of existing space at the san luis facilities provides additional playing card production capacity while the company evaluates production costs and efficiencies achieved in the san luis facilities 
the additional production line will also augment the company s ability to solicit orders from larger and multi site casinos both in the united states and from the international market 
the company s ability to compete for additional market share in playing card sales should be enhanced by the company s anticipated decrease in per unit production costs 
management is analyzing whether the anticipated lower playing card production costs will justify the relocation of other portions of its manufacturing operations to mexico 
new san luis building 
in july  the company s board of directors approved the purchase of an existing approximately  square foot new san luis building located approximately yards from the main facility for  the purchase of the new san luis building is expected to be completed no later than october  the funds for the purchase of the new san luis building will come from cash on hand or a combination of cash on hand and new financing 
the company plans to use the new san luis building to augment its playing card and chip production capabilities to accommodate the anticipated increase in demand for the company s playing cards 
statement on forward looking information certain information included herein contains statements that may be considered forward looking  such as statements relating to anticipated performance  financing sources and the relocation of certain operations 
any forward looking statement made by the company necessarily is based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that  while considered reasonable by the company  is inherently subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the control of the company  and are subject to change 
actual results of the company s operations may vary materially from any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
forward looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the forward looking statements will be achieved 
undue reliance should not be placed on any forward looking statements 
some of the contingencies and uncertainties to which any forward looking statement contained herein is subject include  but are not limited to  the following reliance on expansion of casino industry 
a significant percentage of the company s revenue is generated by sales relating to casino openings and expansions 
as such  the company s future growth will be dependent to a material degree on the continued emergence and growth of new markets for the company s products  including new casino openings or expansions throughout the united states and other areas of the world 
a reduction in the pace of new casino openings and casino expansions in existing and emerging legalized gaming jurisdictions would have a negative effect on the company s business 
similarly  the restriction or abolishment of legalized casino gaming in jurisdictions in which the company currently does business would have a negative impact on the company 
gaming regulations 
the manufacture and distribution of gaming equipment and supplies are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation 
although these regulations vary among jurisdictions  virtually all jurisdictions require licenses  permits and approvals to be held by the company and its key personnel in connection with the manufacture and distribution of some or all of the company s products 
the failure of the company or its key personnel to obtain or retain required licenses  permits or approvals in one or more jurisdictions could have an adverse effect on the company and could adversely affect the ability of the company and its key personnel to obtain or retain licenses in other jurisdictions 
no assurance can be given that such licenses  permits or approvals will be obtained  retained or renewed in the future in existing or emerging jurisdictions 
any beneficial holder of the company s common stock may be subject to investigation by the gaming authorities in any or all of the jurisdictions in which the company operates if such authorities have reason to believe that such ownership may be inconsistent with such state s gaming policies 
persons who acquire beneficial ownership of more than certain designated percentages of the company s common stock will be subject to certain reporting and qualification procedures established by the nevada and other gaming authorities  as well as certain local licensing authorities 
need for tribal state compacts 
the company s ability to generate greater revenues and earnings is dependent in part on the growth of native american tribal casinos 
under igra  the operation of a casino on native american tribal land is not permitted until the native american tribe and the state in which it is located have entered into a tribal state compact authorizing gaming on the tribe s land and such tribal state compact is approved by the secretary of the department of interior 
many states have resisted entering into tribal state compacts  which has resulted in litigation challenging the constitutionality of igra 
if igra were found to be unconstitutional  the procedures that would apply to the initiation and operation of native american tribal casinos would be uncertain 
such a finding could severely limit or delay the expansion of gaming in additional jurisdictions 
in addition  a recent court ruling has placed limits on the ability of native american tribes to force states to enter into tribal state compacts and several states  through legislation or constitutional amendment  have sought to limit the scope of native american gaming under igra 
variability of quarterly operating results 
the company s financial results are dependent in part upon sales to new or expanding casinos  which may  in turn  be dependent upon the authorization of gaming in additional jurisdictions 
the timing of these events does not follow consistent patterns throughout any given year 
given this uncertain timing and the large dollar value of sales to new casinos  the company s future operating results may be subject to significant quarterly fluctuations 
table games growth rate 
the company s primary products are sold to casinos with table games 
in recent years  there has been an increasing allocation of total casino gaming space to slot machines  and in certain cases  a resulting reduction in the allocation of total casino gaming space to table games 
as a result  the growth rate of table games has not matched that of the casino industry as a whole 
although the company s sales and income have continued to increase due to the growth and expansion of the gaming industry  particularly in the newly emerging gaming jurisdictions  the company believes that the company s rate of growth would have been greater if not for this trend 
an acceleration of this trend would have a further negative impact on the company s rate of growth 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant degree on the performance of paul s 
endy  jr  chairman of the board and chief executive officer  eric p 
endy  president and director  and louis w 
degregorio  senior vice president of sales 
the company does not carry key man life insurance for any of these executive officers  and the loss of the services of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on the company 
management anticipates that as the company continues to expand into new gaming jurisdictions throughout the united states and internationally  its future success will depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to fill key sales  administrative and management positions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to locate and retain such individuals 
expansion of international sales 
although currently only a small percentage of the company s sales are to casinos located in foreign countries  a component of the company s business strategy is the expansion of its international sales 
to the extent the company is successful in this endeavor  it will be increasingly subject to the customary risks of doing business in foreign countries 
these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls  nationalization and other economic  tax and regulatory policies of local governments and the possibility of trade embargoes  political instability or war or other hostility  as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 
competition 
there are significant competitors in each of the company s major product lines 
with the continuing expansion of gaming  it is possible that new competitors may be attracted to the table game supply business  some of which may be in the business of selling gaming products  have licenses to sell gaming supplies and have greater financial resources than the company 
the entry by such companies into the company s markets could adversely impact the company s business 
control by existing stockholder  antitakeover effects 
paul s 
endy is the beneficial owner of approximately of the outstanding common stock of the company 
as a result  mr 
endy effectively controls the election of all of the members of the board of directors of the company and effectively controls virtually all matters requiring approval by the stockholders of the company 
such ownership may discourage acquisition of large blocks of the company s securities and could have an anti takeover effect  possibly depressing the price of the common stock 
in addition  nevada corporation law and the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
reliance on suppliers 
for certain of its products  the company is dependent upon a limited number of suppliers to provide the company with raw materials for manufacturing and finished goods for distribution 
the failure of one or more of these suppliers to meet the company s performance specifications  quality standards or delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on the company
