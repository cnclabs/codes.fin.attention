results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year the company s revenues increased by million or to million in fiscal year compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase is due to a significant increase in the commercial managed care division and a slight increase in the government managed care division 
the commercial managed care division revenues increased by million or to million in fiscal year compared to million in this net increase is the result of several increases and a decrease 
the largest increase in commercial managed care division revenue resulted from the bcbsnj isoc project 
effective july   this business relationship was modified such that the company began to provide services under a global capitation arrangement which significantly increased the revenues the company earns as well as the scope of services and resultant cost of service 
the second largest increase was provided by the company s subsidiary  virginia chartered health plan  inc vachp  a medicaid hmo operating in selected markets in the commonwealth of virginia 
vachp commenced operations in november and therefore was only operating for less than half the year during fiscal year in addition  since commencing operations  vachp has continually increased its membership enrollment 
commercial managed care division revenues also increased as a result of the company s isoc development  management and operations related to its strategic ventures  primarily in connecticut 
these commercial managed care division increases were offset by a decrease in revenues at chp  the company s medicaid hmo in the district of columbia 
chp s revenues decreased due to a gradual decrease in enrollment from approximately  members at the end of fiscal year down to approximately  members at the end of fiscal in addition  chp s revenues decreased because effective november   the contractual premium rate was reduced 
the government managed care division revenues increased by million or to million in fiscal compared to million in this net increase is the result of a significant new total managed care correctional facilities project which commenced operations in july  two new ambulatory care projects  one new mental health project and one new medical staffing project  all of which commenced operations since the beginning of the prior fiscal year  and an increase in the number of inmates and in the per inmate reimbursement rate on an existing total managed care correctional facilities project 
these revenue increases were almost entirely offset by decreases related to the completion of seven ambulatory care projects  three mental health projects  and one medical staffing project 
the government managed care division revenues also decreased as a result of the company s restructuring decisions in the third quarter of fiscal which included the company s decision to terminate its long term care line of business in the government managed care division effective december  the results of operations for these projects since december  are presented on the statement of operations on the restructuring charges line item 
the company s gross profit increased by or million  to million for fiscal year compared to million for the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  gross profit decreased to for the current year compared to in fiscal gross profit increased in the commercial managed care division and decreased in the government managed care division 
the commercial managed care division gross profit increase resulted from the operations of vachp which was operational a full year in and less than half a year in fiscal  as discussed above  the operations of the bcbsnj isoc  which became a global capitation healthcare services contract effective july   and increased activity in the company s development  management  and operations related to its strategic provider based isoc ventures  primarily in connecticut 
these gross profit increases were reduced by a decrease from the chp operations resulting from a decrease in membership enrollment and a decrease in the premium rate 
the government managed care division gross profit decreased due to the completion of several projects as described above  partially offset by increases from the commencement of operations on new projects as described above 
general and administrative expenses increased or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily related to the company s commercial managed care division business and is due to additional general and administrative expenses associated with the vachp business which commenced operations in november  increased personnel and facility expenses at chp  increased facility expenses associated with the expansion of the corporate headquarters space  and increased commercial managed care division development expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the current year compared to in fiscal year during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a million reserve for medicaid receivables associated with the company s medicaid operations at chp in the district of columbia  principally relating to services provided during the to contract years 
for several years the company engaged in ongoing good faith discussions and negotiations with the district regarding these amounts 
during february  that process ultimately resulted in an agreement to settle these receivables due the company for an amount significantly in excess of what the company had recorded 
subsequently  however  it became evident to the company  through recent comments in the local press  that payment has been blocked 
the company remains committed to pursuing its contractual rights for the amounts it is due from the district 
however  in light of the clearly prolonged timeframe to resolve these issues  the company determined to recognize this reserve 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recognized million in expense for the retirement package provided by the board of directors to the company s founder  chairman and chief executive officer  charles h 
robbins  upon his retirement from the company 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company incurred restructuring charges of million 
within a broad restructuring effort  this charge resulted from two specific decisions made by the board of directors 
in late november  the company made the strategic decision to terminate its long term care line of business in the government managed care division 
the company determined that maintaining this capability internally was not essential to its success in providing vertically integrated healthcare services  in whole or in part  through the company s isoc products 
in addition  the company determined that the relationship between the risk it assumed on these projects and the opportunity for profit was not adequately balanced 
the company recognized a net loss of million related to the restructuring for the termination of this line of business 
effective january   the company made the strategic decision to terminate the company s facilities development and maintenance function operated out of the corporate offices through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  sterling communities corporation 
the elimination of these activities will allow the company to concentrate its resources and energy on its core missions 
future building and facilities management needs will be fulfilled through outsourced vendor relationships 
the company incurred a restructuring charge of  for severance and other termination costs associated with the elimination of this function 
operating income decreased by million from million in operating income in fiscal to million in operating losses in fiscal operating margin decreased to a loss of from income of 
this decrease is primarily related to the medicaid receivables reserve  the restructuring charges  and the retirement expense that was recognized in fiscal interest expense increased  or million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal this increase is primarily a result of the interest expense the company incurs on the million in convertible subordinated debentures sold by the company during fiscal  in december interest income increased by  from  to  in fiscal and  respectively 
this increase is due to the additional interest earned on the increase in available cash which resulted from the sale of million in convertible subordinated debentures discussed above 
in fiscal  the company recognized a gain of million related to the sale of a interest in its vachp subsidiary for million in cash 
the effective income tax rates of and for fiscal years and  respectively  represent the combined federal and state income tax rates adjusted as necessary 
the gain resulting from the sale of a interest in vachp is a non taxable transaction and therefore no provision for income taxes was included in the company s results of operations for fiscal exclusive of this gain  the combined effective income tax rate for fiscal year would have been 
the company s results of operations decreased by million from net earnings of million to a net loss of million for fiscal years and  respectively  resulting in primary losses per share of in fully diluted  compared with primary earnings per share of fully diluted in fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year the company s revenue decreased by or  to million in fiscal year compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this slight decrease is the net result of an increase in the commercial managed care division and a decrease in the government managed care division 
the fiscal commercial managed care division revenues included million of non recurring construction and pre operational revenue on the bcbsnj project 
exclusive of the non recurring construction and pre operational revenue earned on the bcbsnj project in fiscal year  commercial managed care division revenue increased by million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this net increase is the result of several increases and decreases 
the largest increase in commercial managed care division revenue was due to an increase in operational revenue on the bcbsnj project which commenced operations in january and was therefore operating throughout fiscal but only four months during fiscal the second largest increase in commercial managed care division revenue was provided by chp  and resulted from an expanded enrollment and a new contract at a higher premium rate 
additional revenue increases resulted from revenue earned during fiscal for network development efforts related to strategic ventures in connecticut  georgia  and other markets  revenue resulting from the commencement of operations in november at vachp  increased utilization at two existing integrated health care delivery network projects for large employers  increased software sales at the company s wholly owned subsidiary  health cost consultants hcc  a case management and utilization review services company  and the commencement of operations at a new integrated health care delivery network project for a large employer in january in addition to the commercial managed care division revenue decrease related to the construction and pre operational phases of the bcbsnj project  other revenue decreases resulted from the sale of two outpatient surgery centers in september  and the non recurrence of construction and pre operational revenues earned in the prior year related to an integrated health care delivery network project for a large employer which became operational in january government managed care division revenue decreased by million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily related to the completion of seven ambulatory care projects  two mental health projects  and four medical staffing projects 
offsetting these revenue decreases were revenue increases resulting from the commencement of operations on two new long term care nursing home projects in june  the commencement of operations on a new ambulatory care project in october  the commencement of operations on a new medical staffing project in january  an expanded inmate population and an increase in the contract rate on a total managed care correctional facilities project  an increased contract rate on a long term care nursing home project  and the expansion of services and a corresponding increase in contract rate on one primus project 
the company s gross profit increased by or million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross profit increased to in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
this overall gross profit improvement resulted from a significant increase in the commercial managed care division as well as an increase in the government managed care division 
the commercial managed care division gross profit increase was primarily attributable to an expanded enrollment and a new contract at a higher premium rate at chp 
a gross profit increase also resulted from the commencement of activity on the operating portion of the bcbsnj project in january  and the commencement of operations in december at vachp 
these commercial managed care division gross profit increases were tempered by a decrease resulting from the sale of the remaining two outpatient surgery centers in september the government managed care division gross profit increase was due to an increased contract rate at a long term care nursing home project  increased utilization  improved cost control  and higher award fee revenue at three ambulatory care projects with the navy  an expansion of services and a corresponding increase in the contract rate on one primus project  and an expanded inmate population and an increased contract rate on a total managed care correctional facilities project 
government managed care division gross profits decreased due to the completion of certain projects as cited above for causing revenues to decrease  and due to a decrease in utilization and the contract rate at one navcare project which was completed in september general and administrative expenses increased or million to million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal compared to during the prior year 
the increase is primarily a function of the company s commercial managed care initiatives and is due to increased general and administrative expenses associated with dc chartered and its growing enrollment  additional general and administrative expenses associated with the new vachp subsidiary  increased corporate compensation costs related to the hiring and retention of existing and additional management personnel and support staff  and increased facility expenses resulting from the company s new expanded corporate headquarters office space 
operating income increased more than fivefold from million in fiscal to million for the current year 
operating margin increased to from 
this increase was due to the increased gross profit margins  reduced by increased general and administrative expenses 
interest expense increased  or  to  for fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily a result of the interest on the million in convertible subordinated debentures sold by the company in december partially offsetting this increase is a decrease in interest expense resulting from a decrease in the average outstanding long term debt of the company resulting from the sale of the reston office building in july  and the sale of the remaining two outpatient surgery centers in september interest income increased by  from  in fiscal to  in the current year 
this increase is due to the interest earned on the approximately million in cash and cash equivalents currently available to the company resulting from the sale of million in convertible subordinated debentures in december in fiscal the company recognized a gain of million related to the sale of a interest in vachp for million in cash 
the effective income tax rates of and for fiscal years and  respectively  represent the combined federal and state income tax rates adjusted as necessary 
the gain resulting from the sale of a interest in vachp to university health services  inc  is a non taxable transaction  and therefore no provision for income taxes was included in the company s results of operations for fiscal exclusive of this gain  the combined effective income tax rate for the year would have been net earnings increased by million  from  to million  for fiscal years and  respectively  resulting in primary earnings per share of 
in 
fully diluted  compared with primary and fully diluted earnings per share of in liquidity and capital resources typically  the company s principal sources of funds are operations and bank borrowings 
in december  however  the company issued million of convertible subordinated debentures resulting in net proceeds of million 
the company used these proceeds to extinguish all outstanding bank debt and is using the remaining amount to fund expansion of its commercial managed care division 
for the year ended april   million in cash was used by operating activities 
this represents a decrease in cash provided by operations of million compared with the million provided by operations in the prior year 
the primary cause of this decrease in cash provided by operations was a million decrease in earnings from million in net earnings in to a net loss of million in the company s number of days revenue in average outstanding receivables was days in and days in this increase results from an increase in accounts receivable related to certain commercial managed care division isoc business ventures  and a new receivable related to a large total managed care correctional facilities project in the government managed care division 
investing activities used million in cash during compared to  used in in  the cash used relates primarily to the purchase of certain health centers from bcbsnj on february  the cash used during was due to acquisitions of property and equipment reduced by proceeds from the sale of stock in a subsidiary 
financing activities provided million in compared to million provided by financing activities during in december the company sold million of convertible subordinated debentures resulting in net proceeds of million 
with these proceeds the company completely repaid all of the then outstanding bank debt 
the cash provided by financing activities in the current year relates to borrowings on a revolving promissory note due in august the company believes that the current cash and cash equivalents  anticipated cash flow generated by operations and its borrowing capabilities will be sufficient for known future capital needs of the company  other than the completion of the hip transaction  which will require additional financing 
the company intends to finance the consideration payable in connection with the hip transaction through a combination of bank borrowings and the public or private issuance of debt or equity securities  the availability of which will depend on market conditions and other factors 
in addition  there may be further expansion opportunities which require additional external financing and the company may  from time to time  consider obtaining such funds through the public and private issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that the additional financing required to complete the hip transaction or take advantage of further expansion opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all 
impact of inflation inflation is considered in all contract proposals with contract terms in excess of one year 
the consideration of inflationary factors is particularly important with respect to unit price  fixed rate labor hour  and fixed price contracts 
historically  inflation has not had a significant impact on the operations of the company 
while health care costs nationally are increasing  the company s primary exposure relating to this trend has been related to salaries of health care professionals and costs of pharmaceuticals which the company estimates and prices into all of its long term contracts 
the company may however become involved in future contracts where inflation and increasing health care costs may be an important factor
