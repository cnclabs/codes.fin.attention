beginning in november the company s results of operations reflect its sale to beaver dealers of coaches and trailers purchased from beaver at its wholesale prices  less a discount in consideration for the agreement by the company to satisfy warranty obligations with respect to those products 
because the discount was equal to the warranty accrual with respect to such sales  the company realized no gross profit on its sales of beaver products prior to the acquisition 
these sales represented million and million of the company s sales for and  respectively

honorbuilt was primarily engaged in the design  manufacture  distribution and sale of class c motor coaches under the name brand of el dorado from its facility in minneapolis  kansas 
the company formed a new subsidiary  midwest  to operate the facility 
the acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method 
accordingly  the purchase price of million was allocated to the assets acquired based on their estimated values as of the date of acquisition 
the excess of the consideration paid over the estimated fair value of assets acquired totaled  which was recorded as goodwill and was initially amortized on the straight line basis over years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements on december   the company announced the planned exit and closure of the operations at the minneapolis  kansas facility in an effort to reduce excessive costs that were not anticipated when the company acquired the assets of honorbuilt

n a net income pretax income n a n a pro forma provision for income taxes n a n a pro forma net income n a n a compared to sales increased by million to million for from million for the increase was attributable primarily to a significant increase in sales of beaver coaches  which increased by million compared to  sales of safari coaches  which increased by million compared to  and sales of el dorado coaches produced by the company s newly acquired midwest facility  which totaled million 
increases in parts and service sales of approximately million made up the rest of the increase in sales from beaver unit coach sales increased by units to units in from units in safari unit coach sales increased by units to  units in from  in the company continues to monitor the performance of each of its model lines 
gross profit increased million and increased slightly as a percentage of sales to from in a number of offsetting factors led to relatively stable overall gross margin performance 
the significant increase in beaver coach sales improved gross margin percentage 
beaver products  which sell at higher average prices than the safari models  became a larger portion of the company s overall sales mix in the company s products generally achieve greater gross margin on higher priced coaches  and the significant increase in beaver sales contributed to a greater overall margin performance 
conversely  operating results of the company s start up of midwest  which produces and sells the el dorado class c coaches  reduced gross margin by million 
midwest s inability to achieve profitable performance led to the company s decision to terminate operations at the minneapolis  kansas based facility 
higher warranty costs in compared to also had a negative effect on gross margin 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million to million in from million in selling  general  and administrative costs were and of sales for and  respectively 
selling  general  and administrative costs  in percentage terms  increased more than sales in due to higher legal and accounting costs associated with the company s transition to public company status  increases in staffing required to handle increased sales volume  the commencement of operations at the company s newly formed subsidiaries eda  cti  midwest  and hco  and the company s customer service center 
additionally  travel costs were significantly higher in because employees headquartered in oregon were dispatched to assist with the start up of the midwest facility  and also needed to travel between the newly established subsidiaries in oregon 
the company recorded a pre tax restructuring expense of million in the fourth quarter of million after tax related to the planned exit and closure of the operations at midwest in an effort to reduce excessive costs and eliminate the operating losses associated with midwest 
the major components of the restructuring charge included the write down of goodwill and organizational costs recorded at the time of the acquisition approximately  the reserve for impairment of certain property  plant  and equipment approximately  and other incremental costs of closing the facility approximately 
the combined effect of relatively unchanged gross margin  increased selling  general  and administrative expenses  and the midwest restructuring charge was to decrease operating income by million to million from million in operating income was of sales in compared to of sales in if the restructuring charge and operating loss of midwest during were eliminated  operating income would have been of sales in  the same as in interest expense decreased to  in from  in the decrease was due to lower borrowings on the company s revolving line of credit 
positive cash flows created by profits from operations and reductions in inventory levels during the first half of the year were used to reduce revolving indebtedness 
the strong sales growth at beaver and safari accounted for these operating profits and inventory reductions 
operating losses at midwest resulted in increased borrowings late in  but this did not completely offset the impact of positive cash flows during the first half of the year 
the company s effective tax rate for was  resulting in an income tax provision of million  compared to an effective rate of and an income tax provision of million for the increase in the effective tax rate from to is due to the company s termination of its s corporation tax status and commencement of its tax paying c corporation status effective january  upon conversion to c corporation status  the company recorded a transition deferred tax asset of  this reduced the income tax provision recorded during if the company had been a c corporation before  its effective tax rate in would have been  which would have resulted in an income tax provision of million and would have been comparable to the effective rate of for on a pro forma basis  after adjusting for the deferred tax asset described above  net income after tax decreased  to s actual net income of million from s pro forma net income of million 
the decrease was primarily due to the poor operating performance of midwest 
midwest s operating losses and restructuring charge combined to create an after tax loss of million in this loss was offset in part by income generated by the increase in sales volume at beaver and safari 
excluding the results of the midwest  net income after taxes would have been million  or million above s pro forma net income of million 
compared to sales increased by million to million for from million for the increase was the result of increases in sales of safari coaches of approximately million  offset by a decrease in the sale of beaver coaches of approximately million 
increases in parts and service sales of approximately  made up the rest of the increase in sales from safari unit coach sales increased by to  for from in safari increased its production of coaches by adding a third production line early in to expand production of the sahara model 
sales revenue increased at a higher rate than unit volume due to a shift in customer demand to higher priced products 
sales were made to safari s well established dealer base throughout the united states  as well as to new dealerships added in beaver unit coach sales increased by to for from in beaver s monterey model was introduced in june and was priced significantly lower than other beaver models in order to expand the brand s offerings to the market 
in the process of introducing the new monterey model  beaver increased its dealer distribution network by dealers  some of which carry the higher priced patriot and marquis 
patriot model sales declined sharply in early  in anticipation of a major redesign of the product for the model year 
although patriot sales recovered after the new model introduction in july  sales volume for the full year was lower than in gross profit margin increased million and increased as a percentage of sales to from in the improvement in gross margin percentage is affected by beaver coach sales recorded in prior to smc s acquisition of beaver on june  prior to the acquisition  smc managed the operations of beaver  and under the terms of the management agreement  sales of beaver coaches were passed through smc without any profit margin 
if the sales of product in prior to the acquisition were eliminated  the gross profit margin for would have been 
adjusted gross margin declined by primarily as the result of two factors 
 or 
impact on gross profit was caused by heavier than normal model year end discounting in the second quarter of the company increased discounts due to strong competition from other manufacturers  and market anticipation of significant changes to both safari and beaver model lines prior to the new model year in july changes in model design related to the engine systems installed on both safari and beaver models exceeded original cost estimates by approximately  or 
reduction in gross profit 
the transition to the new engine system is complete  and all of the new product development and implementation costs were reflected in the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative costs were  and of sales for and  respectively 
the percentage increase in costs is largely the result of the pass through sales of beaver in previously noted 
after eliminating the effect of the pass through sales  adjusted selling  general  and administrative expenses increased 
to of sales in  compared to in operating income rose to million in from million in  primarily due to increased sales volume 
proportionately  the percentage increase in operating income was not as large as the percentage increase in sales revenue because of the factors affecting gross margin described above 
interest expense increased to  in from  in due to increased borrowings related to the beaver acquisition which were made on or subsequent to june  and were fully outstanding during while only outstanding for part of increased sales volume also required more use of working capital lines of credit in other income was  for  compared to  in the difference was due primarily to  in fee revenue recorded in pursuant to management fees earned while the company managed the operations of beaver prior to the june  acquisition 
the company terminated its s corporation tax status effective january  and became a tax paying c corporation as of that date 
the company s effective tax rate in was  resulting in an income tax provision of million 
if the company had been an ongoing c corporation  its pro forma effective tax rate in would have been  and the income tax provision would have been million 
for  if the company had been a c corporation  its effective tax rate would have been  and the income tax provision would have been million 
the conversion from s corporation to c corporation tax status on january  resulted in the recording of a transition deferred tax asset of  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
on a pro forma basis  after adjusting for the transition deferred tax asset previously noted  net income was million  an increase of  over s pro forma results 
pro forma earnings per share decreased to 
per share on million shares outstanding  compared to pro forma earnings per share of 
on million shares outstanding 
income taxes prior to january   the company was an s corporation not subject to federal and state income taxes 
in anticipation of its initial public offering  the company terminated its s corporation status and the company paid taxes as a c corporation in pro forma net income reflects federal and state income taxes as if the company had been a c corporation  based on the rates that would have been in effect during the periods reported 
inflation the company does not believe inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations for the periods presented 
factors affecting future operating results the company s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
short term fluctuations in operating results may be caused by a variety of factors  including the relatively high unit cost of the company s motor coaches  the timing of orders from dealers  dealer cancellations of orders  the repurchase of coaches from dealers  new product introductions  production delays and the timing of trade shows and rallies 
because the company s gross profit is generally greater with respect to its more expensive coaches  changes in the product mix of coaches sold can affect the company s operating results 
over longer periods  the cyclical nature of the recreational vehicle industry  changes in interest rates and changes in the level of discretionary consumer spending may also adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the impact of these and other factors on the company s sales and operating results in any future period cannot be predicted with certainty  and the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period 
the company believes that the high line motor coach market is much less volatile than the rv industry as a whole  and believes buyers purchasing high line products are making lifestyle decisions largely independent of factors such as the state of the economy or interest rates 
high line coach sales have increased every year since  while the sale of all class a motor coaches have seen both increases and decreases during this period 
liquidity and capital resources during smc generated million in cashflows from operations  while its net working capital decreased from million at december  to million at december  including cash and cash equivalents of 
the company made capital expenditures of million during approximately million of the expenditures related to the purchase of an aircraft

additionally  approximately million was invested to automate and computerize the cabinet shop at the safari location  and approximately was invested to upgrade production operation at the beaver facility 
the company invested million to start up the company s hco and cti facilities in hines  oregon  including purchases of building and equipment 
the company acquired the assets of honorbuilt for million and made subsequent capital expenditures at the midwest facility of approximately million 
the remaining expenditures were made on various capital projects to maintain the company s growth and production needs 
the company anticipates that its aggregate capital expenditures for will approximate million 
the company has lines of credit of million  with million available at december   plus an additional million equipment financing line of credit  of which million is available at december  amounts outstanding under these lines of credit bear interest at annual rates ranging from prime to prime plus to at december  and are secured by all assets not specifically identified in other financing obligations 
the terms of the revolving credit and equipment financing agreements require compliance with certain financial covenants and other covenants which provide that the company receive consent from the lender to declare or pay dividends in cash  stock or other property 
the covenants also include restrictions relating to mergers  consolidations and sale of assets  guarantees by the company of debts or obligations of other persons or entities  and acquisition of the company s own stock 
the plan of reorganization pursuant to which the company completed the acquisition of beaver also prohibits the company from paying dividends if beaver defaults on payment obligations under the plan 
the company was not in compliance with all covenants and agreements at december   but had received waivers for the conditions of noncompliance  which expire march  the company does not believe any of these covenants will have a material impact on the company s ability to meet its cash obligations 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
most dealer purchases of motor coaches from the company are financed under flooring financing arrangements between the dealer and a bank or finance company 
under these flooring arrangements  the financing institution lends the dealer all or substantially all of the wholesale purchase price of a motor coach and retains a security interest in the coach purchased 
these financing arrangements provide that  for a period of time after a coach is financed generally to months  if the dealer defaults on its payment or other obligations to the lender  the company is obligated to repurchase the dealer s inventory for the amount then due from the dealer plus  in certain circumstances  costs incurred by the lender in connection with repossession of the inventory 
the repurchase price may be more than the resale value of the coach 
the company s contingent liability under its repurchase obligations varies from time to time 
as of december   the company estimates its total contingent liability under repurchase obligations was approximately million 
to date  losses incurred by the company pursuant to repurchase obligations have not been material 
the company cannot predict with certainty its future losses  if any  pursuant to repurchase obligations  and these amounts may vary materially from the expenditures historically made by the company 
furthermore  even in circumstances where losses in connection with repurchase obligations are not material  a repurchase obligation can represent a significant cash requirement for the company
