mtel s principal operations include skytel one way messaging services in the united states  advanced messaging services provided on the narrowband pcs network in the united states and international one way messaging operations 
in september  the company commenced commercial operation of its nationwide narrowband pcs network in the united states 
prior to commencement of commercial operation  substantially all of the costs of developing and constructing the narrowband pcs network were capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
subsequently  the company has expensed all costs associated with the operation of the narrowband pcs network  has begun to depreciate and amortize the infrastructure  spectrum costs and other capitalized costs  and has discontinued the capitalization of interest costs associated with borrowings used to fund the construction and development of the narrowband pcs network

certain statements set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbor created by such section 
when appropriate  certain factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements are enumerated 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report  on form k  including note of notes to consolidated financial statements which discusses certain risks and uncertainties involving the company s ability to generate future positive operating cash flows and operating income and the availability of capital resources needed by the company to fund its business plans 
results of operations revenues 
consolidated revenues increased in as compared to and in as compared to revenues from one way messaging operations in the united states increased in as compared to and in as compared to these increases in revenues were primarily attributable to increases in the number of one way paging and voice messaging units in service in the united states which increased in as compared to and in as compared to the rate of increase in net unit additions was lower in as compared to  primarily as a result of higher than expected disconnect rates in the reseller distribution channel  including mci  and the alternate primarily agent distribution channel 
average revenue per one way messaging unit in service decreased slightly in as compared to  although average revenue per one way messaging unit was favorably impacted by the product mix of units placed in service through skytel s direct distribution channel which generated higher average revenue per unit than other distribution channels and constituted a significant portion of net unit additions in the company restructured its distribution arrangement with mci in the fourth quarter of and entered into new agreements with certain other major resellers in the first quarter of the company believes that the revised terms of these reseller arrangements  which provide for separate charges for airtime and the unbundling of certain support services that were previously included as components of the reseller product offering  together with the availability of new product offerings on the narrowband pcs network in  will result in increased net unit additions from this distribution channel in in addition  under the restructured agreement with mci  the company is no longer required to lease paging units to mci  which will reduce the acquisition costs to the company of units placed in service through this distribution channel and result in additional free cash flow for the company 
in  the company intends to emphasize the distribution of a family of advanced messaging services  including advanced text messaging  two way interactive messaging and fixed location services  all of which are expected to be available beginning in the second quarter of the company believes that the narrowband pcs network provides the company with the opportunity to place a substantially higher number of units in service because of significantly increased network capacity due to higher transmission speed and spectrum reuse 
this increased capacity should permit the company to achieve improved cash flow from operations on an incremental basis at such time as the company places a sufficient number of advanced messaging units in service to cover the fixed costs of the narrowband pcs network and operating costs decline as a percentage of revenues 
the ability of the company to achieve adequate levels of net unit additions will depend upon the success of the direct  reseller and other distribution channels  the commercial acceptability of the advanced messaging services that will be available on the narrowband pcs network and the competitive environment  including pricing  for competing services 
in  skytel began to offer a bundled package of nationwide and local messaging services to fortune companies in order to further penetrate the national accounts market and to respond to customer requests for single source solutions to their messaging needs 
in order to facilitate this strategy  in february  the company acquired united states paging corporation uspc in a merger in which each share of uspc common stock was exchanged for of a share of mtel common stock  or an aggregate of approximately million shares of mtel common stock having a value at the time of the transaction of approximately million
