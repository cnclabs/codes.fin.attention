the following discussion highlights the major changes affecting the operations and financial condition of the company for the three years ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues and income from the operation of its subsidiary  the bank  which provides a full range of commercial and consumer banking services to businesses and individuals in the north and east texas area 
as of december  the company had total assets of  net loans of  total deposits of  and total shareholders equity of  the company reported net income of  for the year ended december  compared with net income of  for the year ended december  as a result of internal loan growth within its niche products of insurance premium financing and insurance medical claims factoring  and its acquisition of a community bank and a factoring company 
on may  the bank acquired the farmers guaranty state bank of kennard  texas 
on december  the bank acquired first national bank  whitesboro  texas and on september  the bank acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of the waxahachie  texas branch of bank one  texas  national association 
on february  the company acquired first midlothian corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  first national bank 
these banking facilities are all operated as branches of the bank 
in addition  on march  the bank acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of providers funding corporation 
the company views these acquisitions as a means of expanding its operations and anticipates they will contribute favorably to future results of the company 
the company continues to actively serve the banking needs of these local communities  as it has served the local communities of its other branches 
the deposits at these new branches will allow the company to increase its niche lending activities of insurance premium financing and insurance medical claims factoring 
the company s strategy is to continue to acquire community banks with low loan to deposit ratios and to use excess deposits to fund insurance premium financing and other niche lending products

results of operations net earnings net earnings were  per share for the year ended december   compared with net earnings of  per share for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
factors contributing to the increase in earnings in compared with include an increase in net interest income  growth in the company s niche lending products  and growth of noninterest income mainly as a result of the acquisition of first midlothian corporation  midlothian  texas and the acquisition of providers funding corporation 
see item business acquisitions 
net earnings were  for per share  compared with net earnings of  for per share 
the increase in earnings in  compared with  was attributable to an increase in net interest income resulting from improved asset quality  growth in the company s niche lending products and acquisitions of community banks

the company returned to paying federal income taxes at the effective rate of during  compared with a nominal effective tax rate for as a result  the net income for the years ended december  and may be more indicative of operating trends in the future 
conversely  earnings before income taxes in the period may be more useful when comparing results with prior periods 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
the net yield on total interest earning assets  also referred to as interest rate margin or net interest margin  represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
the company s principal interest earning assets are loans  investment securities  medical receivables factoring and federal funds sold 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or compared with the year ended december   resulting principally from an increase in average interest earning assets from million to million  a significant portion of which was comprised of loans typically the highest yielding asset 
the increase in average interest earning assets was offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities from million to million 
in addition  the company experienced an increase in the net interest spread of basis points from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the foregoing increase resulted principally from the fact that the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points while the yield on interest earning assets remained unchanged at for and net interest income was million for  an increase of million or compared with net interest income of million for  which represented an increase of million or compared with net interest income of million for the company s average total interest earning assets increased from approximately million for to million for  representing a increase resulting principally from an increase in loans 
the net interest margin of for decreased basis points from for and is attributed to the decrease in the average loan to deposit ratio in the average loan to deposit ratio for was as compared to for the company s average total interest earning assets increased from million for to million for  representing a increase resulting principally from an increase in loans and investment securities 
the company s net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as a volume change 
it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing deposits and other borrowed funds  referred to as a rate change 
the net yield on total interest earning assets from to remained unchanged at and resulted principally from an increase in the average yield on all loan products 
the yield on the investment portfolio and federal funds sold decreased from to as a result of changes in interest rates within the marketplace 
the yield on loans increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the following table sets forth for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities the average amounts outstanding  the interest earned or paid on such amounts and the average rate paid for the three years ended december   and the table also sets forth the average rate earned on all interest earning assets  the average rate paid on all interest bearing liabilities  and the net yield on average interest earning assets for the same periods

provision for credit losses the amount of the provision for credit losses is based on periodic not less than quarterly evaluations of the loan portfolio  with particular attention directed toward nonperforming and other potential problem loans 
during these evaluations  consideration is given to such factors as management s evaluation of specific loans  the level and composition of nonperforming loans  historical loss experience  results of examinations by regulatory agencies  an internal asset review process  the market value of collateral  the strength and availability of guaranties  concentrations of credits  and other judgmental factors 
the company determines separate general allowances for insurance premium financing and non insurance premium financing loans 
the company s loss experience on insurance premium financing lending was adversely affected during the second half of by the failure of a non best rated insurance company 
the company has implemented certain changes in its lending policies and procedures with respect to insurance premium financing lending which have reduced the maximum concentration by insurance carrier except as approved by the board of directors and have also reduced the amount of loans secured by unearned premiums of insurance policies written by non rated carriers 
see item business insurance premium financing 
as a result of these changes in loan policy and recoveries of previously charged off insurance premium financing loans  the company s historical loss factor on insurance premium finance loans has improved from in to in  and the company recorded a  provision for credit losses during the year ended december  compared with  in   in and  in the increase in the provision when compared with was necessitated by the growth in the loan portfolio 
the decrease in the provision when compared with was due to an improvement in the company s ratio of net charge offs to average loans improved for this period 
noninterest income noninterest income is generated primarily from fees associated with noninterest and interest bearing accounts as well as fees associated with loans eg  late fees 
noninterest income for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared with noninterest income of  for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest income is attributed to the acquisition of first midlothian corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  first national bank  midlothian  texas  during  as well as an increase in loans outstanding 
the acquisition of first national bank increased the number and balance of loans outstanding along with the number and balance of noninterest and interest bearing deposit accounts  which resulted in increased noninterest income 
noninterest income for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared with noninterest income of  for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest income is attributed to the acquisition of the farmers guaranty state bank  kennard  first national bank  whitesboro during  and the waxahachie branch of bank one during  as well as an increase in loans outstanding 
the acquisition of the three banks increased the number and balance of loans outstanding and increased the number and balance of noninterest and interest bearing deposit accounts  which resulted in increased noninterest income 
the following table sets forth the various categories of noninterest income for the years ended december   and noninterest income years ended december  noninterest income nonsufficient fund charges    late fee charges    service charges    collection fees    credit life insurance    secured credit card annual fee    other    total noninterest income    noninterest expense noninterest expense was  for the year ended december   an increase of  or compared with noninterest expense of  for the year ended december  this increase resulted principally from the acquisition of first midlothian corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  first national bank  and providers funding corporation 
the addition of first national bank and providers funding corporation resulted in additional personnel  occupancy and office expenses 
the amortization of intangibles increased in as a result of the addition of goodwill and costs in the amount of  associated with the acquisition of first national bank and the addition of goodwill and costs in the amount of  associated with the acquisition of providers funding corporation 
noninterest expense was  for the year ended december   an increase of  or compared with noninterest expense of  for the year ended december  this increase resulted principally from the acquisition of the farmers guaranty state bank of kennard  kennard  texas  first national bank  whitesboro  texas during  and the waxahachie branch of bank one during the addition of the three banks resulted in additional personnel  occupancy and office expenses 
the amortization of intangibles increased in as a result of the addition of goodwill and costs associated with the acquisition of the farmers guaranty state bank of kennard in the amount of  the addition of goodwill and costs associated with the acquisition of first national bank in the amount of  and the addition of goodwill and costs associated with the acquisition of the waxahachie branch of bank one in the amount of  deposits held by the bank are insured by the bank insurance fund bif of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the fdic assessment is calculated on the level of deposits held by the bank 
the bif assessment rate is determined by the fdic for categories of banks based upon the risk to the insurance fund 
on august  the fdic s board of directors voted to significantly reduce the deposit insurance premiums paid by most banks 
under the new rate structure  which became effective september  the best rated institutions insured by the bif paid per of domestic deposits  down from the rate of per effective january the fdic s board of directors voted again to reduce the deposit insurance premiums paid by most banks 
under the new rate structure  assessments ranged from zero to cents per of domestic deposits  subject to a minimum annual assessment of  under this structure  the bank in was assessed at a zero rate and paid the minimum assessment rate of  in november of the fdic s board of directors voted to retain the existing bif assessment schedule for  but eliminated the minimum assessment amount  and approved an assessment against bif assessable deposits to be paid to the financing corporation fico to assist in paying interest on fico bonds  which financed the resolution of the thrift industry series

these rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the bank  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
the objective of monitoring and managing the interest rate risk position of the balance sheet is to contribute to earnings and to minimize the adverse changes in net interest income 
the potential for earnings to be affected by changes in interest rates is inherent in a financial institution 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and changes in net interest income due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
an asset sensitive position in a given period will result in more assets being subject to repricing  therefore  as interest rates rise  such a position will have a positive effect on net interest income 
conversely  in a liability sensitive position  where liabilities reprice more quickly than assets in a given period  a rise in interest rates will have an adverse effect on net interest income 
one way to analyze interest rate risk is to evaluate the balance of the interest rate sensitivity position 
a mix of assets and liabilities that are roughly equal in volume and term and repricing represents a matched interest rate sensitivity position 
any excess of assets or liabilities in a particular period results in an interest rate sensitivity gap 
the following table presents the interest rate sensitivity for the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities months months year months to to to over or less months year years years total interest earning assets interest earning deposits in financial institutions     investment securities       federal funds sold   loans       interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits   savings deposits   time deposits      interest bearing liabilities      period interest sensitivity gap       cumulative interest sensitivity gap       cumulative gap as a percent of total assets cumulative interest sensitive assets as percent of cumulative interest sensitive liabilities the cumulative rate sensitive gap position at one year was a liability sensitive position of million  or negative 
a closer examination of the investment securities reveals that the call options on securities within the portfolio that are expected to be exercised will change the cumulative rate sensitive gap position at one year to a liability sensitive position of million  or negative  which indicates that the company is currently in a closely matched interest rate sensitive position 
accordingly  the company believes it will not experience a significant impact from changes in interest rates 
the company undertakes this interest rate sensitivity analysis to monitor the potential risk to future earnings from the impact of possible future changes in interest rates on currently existing net assets or net liability positions 
however  this type of analysis is as of a point in time  when in fact the company s interest rate sensitivity can quickly change as market conditions  customer needs  and management strategies change 
thus  interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time 
the company s investment policy does not permit the purchase of derivative financial instruments or structured notes 
the preceding table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competitive and other pressures 
currently  the bank is holding  in mortgage backed securities 
although the mortgage backed securities have a stated maturity greater than five years  it is not uncommon for mortgage backed securities to fully pay down well ahead of stated maturities 
as a result  assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may  in fact  reprice at different times and at different rate levels 
analysis of financial condition loans and asset quality the company s loans are diversified by borrower and industry group 
loan growth has occurred every year over the past five years and can be attributed to acquisitions  increased loan demand and the addition of new lending products 
the following table describes the composition of loans by major categories outstanding at december     and loan portfolio analysis december  aggregate principal amount loans  net of unearned interest insurance premium financing      commercial loans      installment loans      real estate loans      medical claims receivable      total loans      less unearned interest      allowance for credit losses      total net loans      percentage of loan portfolio loans  net of unearned interest insurance premium financing commercial loans installment loans real estate loans medical claims receivable total the concentration of insurance premium financing loans may expose the bank to greater risk of loss than would a more diversified loan portfolio 
as of december  and commitments of the bank under standby letters of credit and unused lines of credit totaled approximately  and  respectively 
stated loan maturities including floating rate loans reset to market interest rates of the total loan portfolio  net of unearned income  as of december  were stated loan maturities one within year to after one five five year years years total stated loan maturities floating rates reset insurance premium financing   commercial and real estate loans     medical claims receivable   total     rate sensitivities of the total loan portfolio before unearned income as of december  were as follows loan repricing one year after within to five five one year years years total fixed rate     variable rate    non accrual    total     the maturities presented above are based upon contractual maturities 
many of these loans are made on a short term basis with the possibility of renewal at time of maturity 
all loans  however  are reviewed on a continuous basis for creditworthiness 
nonperforming assets the company s financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  including the recognition of interest income on its loan portfolio  unless a loan is placed on a nonaccrual basis 
loans are placed on a nonaccrual basis when there are serious doubts regarding the complete collectibility of principal and interest 
amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest after all principal has been collected 
troubled debt restructurings are those for which concessions  including reduction of interest rates or deferral of interest or principal  have been granted  due to a borrowers weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
it is the policy of the bank not to renegotiate the terms of a loan simply because of a delinquent status 
rather  a loan is generally transferred to a nonaccrual status if it is not in the process of collection and is delinquent in payment of either principal or interest beyond days 
loans which are days delinquent but are well secured and in the process of collection are not included in nonperforming assets 
other nonperforming assets consist of real estate acquired through loan foreclosures or other workout situations and other assets acquired through repossessions 
the following table summarizes nonperforming assets by category as of december  and nonperforming assets nonaccrual loans   loans days past due and still   accruing interest total nonperforming loans   other real estate owned and other assets   total nonperforming assets   nonperforming assets to total assets nonperforming loans to total loans the classification of a loan on nonaccrual status does not necessarily indicate that the principal is uncollectible  in whole or in part 
a determination as to collectibility is made by the bank on a case by case basis 
the bank considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect nonaccrual loans 
the final determination as to these steps is made on a case by case basis 
alternatives that are considered are foreclosure  collecting on guarantees  restructuring the loan or collection lawsuits 
the following table sets forth a summary of other real estate owned and other collateral acquired as of december  other real estate owned other collateral acquired number of net book description parcels autos carrying value vacant land or unsold lots  repossessed automobiles  allowance for credit losses in originating loans  the company recognizes that credit losses will be experienced and the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and  in the case of a collaterialized loan  the quality of the collateral for such loan 
the allowance for credit losses represents the company s estimate of the allowance necessary to provide for losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
in making this determination  the company analyzes the ultimate collectibility of the company s loan portfolio  incorporating feedback provided by the internal loan review staff and provided by examinations performed by regulatory agencies 
the company makes an ongoing evaluation as to the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
to establish the appropriate level of the allowance  all loans including nonperforming loans  commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are reviewed and classified as to potential loss exposure 
specific allowances are then established for those loans  commitments to extend credit or standby letters of credit with identified loss exposure and an additional allowance is maintained based upon the size  quality  and concentration characteristics of the remaining loan portfolio using both historical quantitative trends and the company s evaluation of qualitative factors including future economic and industry outlooks 
the determination by the company of the appropriate level of allowance amount was  at december  the allowance for credit losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed monthly and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known

the allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans 
the following allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts or the relative proportion of future charges to the allowance 
such a table is merely a convenient device for assessing the adequacy of the allowance as a whole 
the following allocation table has been derived by applying a general allowance to the portfolio as a whole  in addition to specific allowance amounts for internally classified loans 
in retrospect  the specific allocation in any particular category may prove excessive or inadequate and consequently may be reallocated in the future to reflect the then current condition 
accordingly  the entire allowance is available to absorb losses in any category

investment securities which are classified as held to maturity are purchased with the intent and ability of the company to hold them to maturity as evidenced by the strong capital position of the company and short maturity of the portfolio 
securities classified as held to maturity are carried at historical cost 
the company s financial planning anticipates income streams based on normal maturity and reinvestment 
the short duration of the portfolio provides adequate liquidity through normal maturities 
investment securities classified as available for sale are purchased with the intent to provide liquidity and to increase returns 
the securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value 
the company does not have any securities classified as trading 
as of december   million in investment securities were classified as held tomaturity and million were classified as available for sale 
on february  the bank s investment portfolio increased by million as a result of the acquisition of first national bank  midlothian  texas 
the securities added to the investment portfolio through the acquisition increased the size of the investment portfolio by approximately 
the securities acquired through the acquisition closely matched the investment objectives of the bank  therefore  no securities were sold after the acquisition 
on december  the bank s investment portfolio increased by million as a result of the acquisition of the bank in whitesboro 
the securities added to the investment portfolio through the acquisition increased the size of the investment portfolio by approximately 
this large increase resulted in a need to restructure the investment portfolio in an effort to address capital budgeting needs and to address the bank s investment objectives 
during the first quarter of  million in available for sale securities were sold for gross realized gains of and no gross recognized losses 
as of december  proceeds from the maturity of held to maturity securities were million and the maturity of available for sale securities were million

at december   of the bank s interest bearing liabilities were in the form of time deposits of  and over 
substantially all of such large deposits were obtained from the bank s market area  and none were obtained through brokers 
management believes these deposits to be a stable source of funds 
however  if a large number of these time deposits matured at approximately the same time and were not renewed  the bank s liquidity could be adversely affected 
currently  the maturities of the bank s large time deposits are spread throughout the year  with maturing in the first quarter of  maturing in the second quarter of  maturing in the second half of  and the remaining maturing thereafter 
the bank monitors those maturities in an effort to minimize any adverse effect on liquidity

on february  the company completed a primary and secondary offering of its common stock 
the offering was underwritten by hoefer arnett  incorporated  a san francisco investment banking firm 
a total of  shares of common stock were sold in the offering at a price of per share  including  shares of common stock sold as an over allotment and  shares of common stock held by a shareholder of the company 
the proceeds from this offering were used by the company to finance the acquisition of first national bank  midlothian  texas  to retire the company s outstanding bank debt and for general corporate purposes 
on february  the company completed the acquisition of first national bank  midlothian  texas first national  through the consolidation of first national and the bank 
in connection with the transaction  the bank changed its main office to the former main office of first national in midlothian  texas  and operated its own former main office in lufkin  texas as a branch 
effective april   the bank changed the location of its main office to hurst  texas  and operates its former main office in midlothian  texas as a branch 
with the completion of this acquisition  the bank increased its asset size by approximately 
as of december  first national had total assets of  and the bank had total assets of  in the transaction  a subsidiary of the bank was first merged with and into first national s parent holding company  first midlothian corporation first midlothian  pursuant to which merger the shareholders of first midlothian received cash in exchange for their shares of capital stock of first midlothian in an amount equal to approximately one hundred fifty percent of the book value of first national 
immediately following the merger  first national and the bank consolidated under the charter of the bank 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the assets and liabilities of first national have been recorded at their fair values as of february  the company raised million during  million during   during  and  during through the sale  in registered offerings  private offerings and incentive stock option exercises  of the company s common stock 
management anticipates that future registered and private offerings of the company s common stock may be used to raise additional capital  in connection with acquisitions or if the regulatory capital requirements with which the bank must comply necessitate the injection of additional capital by the company into the bank 
failure to raise such additional capital could adversely impact the growth of the bank or result in its failure to comply with applicable regulatory capital requirements  which could necessitate a reduction in the volume of assets and deposits of the bank 
such reductions could adversely affect the bank s earnings and liquidity 
see item business supervision and regulation capital adequacy guidelines 
in the longer term  the liquidity of the company and its ability to meet its cash obligations will depend substantially on its receipt of dividends from the bank  which are limited by banking statutes and regulations

the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb has announced a policy sometimes known as the source of strength doctrine which requires a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks 
the frb has interpreted this requirement to require that a bank holding company  such as the company  stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity 
the frb has stated that it would generally view a failure to assist a troubled or failing subsidiary bank in these circumstances as an unsound or unsafe banking practice or a violation of regulation y or both  justifying a cease and desist order or other enforcement action  particularly if appropriate resources are available to the bank holding company on a reasonable basis 
the requirement that a bank holding company  such as the company  make its assets and resources available to a failing subsidiary bank could have an adverse effect upon the company and its shareholders

accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan as amended by sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
together  these standards require that when a loan is impaired  a creditor shall measure impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent or the loan s observable market price 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the new standards also require certain disclosures regarding impaired loans 
the company adopted these standards effective january  the adoption of these accounting standards did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations since the company s recognition and measurement policies regarding nonperforming loans are materially consistent with the accounting standards

 earnings per share fas 
fas simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share eps previously found in apb opinion no 
 earnings per share opinion  and make them comparable to international eps standards 
fas replaces the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps 
basic eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity 
diluted eps is computed similarly to fully diluted eps pursuant to opinion fas also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted eps on the face of the income statement for entities with complex capital structures and a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic eps computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted eps computation 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after december   including interim periods  earlier application is not permitted

fas is effective for financial statements issued for periods after december  management believes that the adoption of these pronouncements will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the company 
impact of inflation  changing prices and monetary policies the financial statements and related financial data concerning the company in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the bank  including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and federal agencies  particularly the federal reserve bank 
the federal reserve bank implements national monetary policy such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  control of the discount rate applicable to borrowing by banks and establishment of reserve requirements against bank deposits 
the actions of the federal reserve bank in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and affect the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature  timing and impact of any future changes in federal monetary and fiscal policies on the bank and its results of operations are not predictable 
related party transactions in the ordinary course of business  the bank has loans  deposits and other transactions with its executive officers and directors and businesses with which such persons are associated 
it is the company s policy that all such transactions are entered into on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated third parties 
during  the bank extended loans of  to director related companies 
subsequent events none
