overview the company provides open architecture  fully integrated on line information management solutions that enable relationship oriented financial institutions to efficiently manage their businesses and offer real time customized financial services hours per day  seven days per week 
these solutions allow the company s customers to provide among other things financial services such as checking  savings and investment accounts  credit and debit cards  atm access and consumer lending 
the company s products are today primarily targeted at large and mid sized credit unions and are currently installed and used as an in house solution by approximately credit unions  which together have over million members 
additionally  the company s products are currently used by six service organizations representing over credit unions with approximately  members 
a significant portion of the company s revenues to date have been from software licenses and hardware sales related to the company s ultrafis system and the company expects revenues related to the ultrafis system to represent a significant portion of its total revenues for the next several years 
the company derives its revenues from software license fees  maintenance fees  service bureau operation fees and disaster recovery services  custom development  training and installation services and sales of third party software and hardware products 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are derived from substantial contracts with organizations that have long decision making cycles  typically from six to twelve months 
the decision to purchase the company s products is followed by an installation and training cycle  which is labor intensive and generally requires from three to twelve months to complete 
each new customer system consists of the company s ultrafis product which may be combined with selected client server applications  hardware and services 
in  such sales to new customers totaled systems  compared to systems in and systems in the average selling price of a new customer system was approximately  in  compared to approximately million in and approximately  in less than of the new customer system sales in had selling prices over million while over of the new sales were over million  including one transaction of million 
the largest system transaction in had a selling price of approximately  the increased size and complexity of the new system sales transactions compared to the system sales impacted the company s ability to properly scope both the resources required and the project management requirements of installations related to these new customers 
consequently  many of the installations pursuant to new system sales occurred during with the increase in system sales and the introduction and demand for the company s new client server applications across its customer base  the company found itself poorly prepared to manage the increased requirements placed on its training and installation and customer support organizations 
the company believes that the number of large customer system sales in and the company s difficulties in some of the installations of these large systems impacted the number of these types of sales by the company in software products as complex as those offered by the company often contain undetected errors or failures  or contain new functionality that may not meet customer expectations 
nevertheless  through the company had no history of product returns or significant customer credits or other customer economic accommodations 
however  during the company experienced customer difficulties in two areas  the introduction of certain new client server products and installation delays on several new customer installations 
the company s customers expressed strong demand for the new client server applications causing the company to release certain products before implementation of an effective product field testing process 
customer difficulties occurred as certain product errors and failures arose and as customers became aware of certain perceived functionality issues 
as a result  broad market acceptance did not occur  and the company made some economic accommodations as the company worked to resolve the product issues 
this difficult introduction of new client server applications and the increase in system sales caused severe strain on the company s training and installation and customer support organizations 
as a result  several new customers experienced delays and inefficiencies in their installations  and two customers elected to suspend their conversion process and seek a cancellation from the company 
these customer difficulties caused  among other things  increases in the company s unbilled revenues  a significant increase in the company s reserve for doubtful accounts and sales returns and contributed to significant decreases in new customers and software sales during the last two quarters of results of operations revenues the company s revenues are comprised of software  customer maintenance  services and other revenues and hardware revenues 
total revenues increased in fiscal to million  compared to million in and million in software revenues decreased in fiscal to million  compared to million in and million in this decline was associated with a reduction of overall software revenue within the new system mix compared to  which more than offset the growth in client server application sales 
the company s maintenance revenues are derived from annual support agreements with its customers 
maintenance revenue increased in fiscal to million  up from million in and million in the increases in and were both primarily a result of growth in new ultrafis system customers  the volume of new client server application modules introduced in installed during the year and a cpi price increase 
the company s in house customer base excluding service bureau customers grew to approximately systems on december  from approximately systems on december  and customers on december  services and other revenues includes training and installation  custom development  service bureau operation fees and disaster recovery contracts 
services and other revenue increased by in fiscal to million  compared to million in and million in the revenue growth for was primarily due to increases in training and installation activities due to the number of new customer installations and client server application module installations 
the decline in service revenue compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in length of installation time on larger new customer systems sold during that period which lowered training and installation activities as well as custom development 
hardware revenue increased in fiscal to million  compared to million in and million in hardware revenues depend on the mix of customer orders and the timing of particular customer installations and fluctuate substantially from year to year 
the company completed of the year s hardware shipments during the first quarter of due to the high volume of new order activities which occurred during the second half of gross margins gross margin as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in down from in and in the primary cause of the decline in was that installations and training for new system conversions a large component of the services and other segment operated at a loss for the year due to cost overruns on committed contracts and associated travel expenses 
gross margins between and remained relatively constant 
software gross margin as a percentage of software revenue declined in to down from in and in this decrease in was due to a higher proportion of sales of software purchased and licensed from third parties 
the increase in was due to the number of large new customer system sales that have a lower proportion of third party software relative to total software 
maintenance gross margin as a percentage of maintenance declined by in to down from in and in the decrease was primarily due to increases in the number of employees to address customer support calls regarding the company s products and increases in new customers 
the margin for maintenance for was consistent with services and other revenues gross margin as a percentage of services and other revenues declined by in to down from in and in the decrease was primarily due to cost overruns on new customer installations and increased costs experienced by the company for travel and direct expenses on contracts higher than those contracted for by the customer 
the decrease between and was due to increases in custom development services during that are sold at lower margins than other services 
hardware gross margin as a percentage of hardware revenues improved during by to compared to in and in the improvement in was due to the sale of higher margin hardware associated with the client server applications offered by the company during the decrease between and was due to several large customers in receiving higher discounts on their hardware purchases 
other operating expenses product development expenses increased to million in up from million in and million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in staffing and contract programmers to develop new client server applications such as ultraaccess remote banking modules  financial services platform modules fsp  optical disk systems modules  voice response iv  product enhancements  and regulatory compliance 
the increase between and was primarily due to increased staffing for client server applications introduced in product development expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to in  up from in and selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and million in the company increased staff to address the sale of the company s increasing array of application modules to the existing customer base and to enhance the product marketing function for these and other new products 
interest income expense  net interest income expense  net increased to  in compared to net interest expense of  in  primarily due to the earnings from the investment of the funds generated by the company s initial public offering 
future operating results the company s future operating results will depend upon conditions in its market that may affect demand for its products and its ability to enhance its existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis 
the company must also manage growth and change effectively as failure to do so could materially and adversely affect its business and operating results 
in connection with the audit of the company s financial statements  the company s independent accountants identified certain reportable conditions relating to material weaknesses in the company s internal controls 
with respect to the company s process for new product releases  the company s independent accountants noted material weaknesses in its field testing procedures and customer communication  resulting in installation delays and aging of receivables and unbilled revenues and the shipment of products in advance of the company s capacity to install on a timely basis resulting in a significant increase in unbilled revenues 
material weaknesses were also identified in the company s procedures for timely analyzing customer balances  estimating the overall cost of training and installation obligations and the cost to complete at any particular time 
these material weaknesses were exacerbated by inefficiencies in the company s accounting system 
as a result of these material weaknesses in the company s accounting system  the auditors expressed significant concerns about the company s ability to report timely  accurate financial information in the future 
although the company has taken steps to address certain of these issues and intends to take steps to address all of these issues  there can be no assurance that the company will resolve all of these issues in a timely manner 
the company has reorganized its management structure and added new management in an effort to address change in its business and is adapting its financial and operational control systems to respond to such changes 
the company is in the early stages of this reorganization process and there can be no assurances that the company will achieve these objectives 
in addition  nigel gallop  chairman of the company  who has played a significant role in the company and who has led this reorganization  has resigned as chief executive officer 
the company has promoted a new chief executive officer 
mr 
gallop will remain as chairman of the company 
the failure of new management to effectively carry out the company s strategic plans could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
installation of the company s ultrafis system is a complex process that must typically be done without any disruption of the customer s service 
because a portion of the company s contracts may include development of custom software  adaptation to customer needs and significant training and installation efforts  a failure by the company to anticipate the time and expenses associated with such development and adaptation could result in increased costs  delays  or reduced revenues and margin 
in the company experienced difficulty in the installation and training process on several conversions  resulting in delays  reductions in revenues and increases in expenses primarily as a result of the increase in new customer activity in and the failure of the company s training and installation organization to be able to perform to contract schedules 
failure by the company to successfully install an ultrafis system could result in significant loss of revenue in a particular quarter and fluctuation in the company s results of operations 
although the company schedules the installations of its products several months in advance  its ability to achieve its revenue plans  both in the near term and in the long term  depends on the company s continued ability to sign new customer contracts and to complete such contracts on schedule 
failure to close new customer contracts as a result of lost sales or deferrals of customer decisions could have a material adverse impact on the future operating results 
there can be no assurance that sales or installations will continue to occur at historical rates or in accordance with the company s expectations 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a small variation in the timing of the recognition of specific revenues could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company has previously experienced delays in the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements  including certain of its client server products 
the length of these delays has varied depending upon the size and scope of the project and the nature of the problems encountered 
any significant delay in the development of new products  or the failure of these new products  if and when installed  to achieve a significant degree of market acceptance  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past  and may do so in the future 
operating results may fluctuate due to factors such as the demand for the company s products  the introduction and acceptance of new products and product enhancements by the company or its competitors  changes in the levels of operating expenses  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  competitive conditions in the credit union and financial services markets and economic conditions generally or in various industry segments 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s business has been derived from substantial contracts with large organizations with long decision making cycles  and the timing of such orders has caused material fluctuations in the company s operating results 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations regarding future revenues and in the short term are fixed to a large extent 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  if anticipated revenues do not occur or are delayed  the company s operating results would be disproportionately affected 
the company expects quarterly and annual fluctuations to continue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  software products as complex as those offered by the company often contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments 
the occurrence of such errors could result in loss of  or delay in  market acceptance of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantially all of the company s revenues historically have been related to the company s ultrafis system  and the company expects that for several years a substantial portion of its revenues will continue to be related to the ultrafis system 
the company is also dependent upon the success of its new client server products 
the company s success will depend in large part on its ability to sell  install  maintain and enhance the ultrafis system and client server products and to develop  on a timely and cost effective basis utilizing new technologies  application modules that meet evolving customer needs 
any failure by the company to anticipate or to respond adequately to new and changing market conditions  enhance the ultrafis system and develop application modules  compete with new product offerings by third parties  complete new standalone product offerings  respond to emerging industry standards  adapt to changing technologies  maintain sales of the company s products  or continue to sign and complete new customer contracts would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
on october  the us district court ruled that federal credit unions may not extend membership benefits to individuals who are not part of the credit union s original charter group 
this ruling imposes limits on new customers that a federal credit union may attract 
as a result  some federal credit unions have expressed a reluctance to pursue extensive capital purchases until the impact of the ruling is further assessed 
accordingly  if this ruling results in deferred customer purchase decisions for the company s products  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
while federal credit unions represent approximately of all credit unions  less than half of these credit unions are affected by this ruling 
liquidity and capital resources the company s management believes current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  expected cash generated from operations and the available bank line of credit will satisfy its expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the immediate future 
in september  the company entered into an agreement with a bank to obtain a million revolving line of credit  bearing interest at the bank s prime rate  at december  and a million capital equipment facility bearing interest at prime plus 
the company was in violation of certain financial covenants under this agreement as of december  and march  in may  the bank waived these violations  and the company and the bank restructured their relationship under a factoring agreement  which replaces the revolving line of credit 
the factoring agreement provides for borrowing by the company of up to million  to be effected by the bank s purchase of eligible accounts receivable and payment to the company of an amount equal to of the purchased accounts receivable 
purchases of receivables and corresponding advances to the company are at the discretion of the bank 
there is a administrative fee for each receivable purchased and a monthly finance charge for as long as each purchased receivable remains outstanding 
the factoring agreement renews  unless terminated by the company or the bank  in april the agreement also provides that the borrowings are secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the company 
as of december  there was no outstanding balance under the revolving facility and the outstanding balance on the capital equipment facility was  as of april   the outstanding balance on the capital equipment facility was  as part of the new agreement  no further draws will be available and the company will establish cash collateral for this balance 
the company expects to pay off this balance and relieve the cash collateral by obtaining asset backed lending from another source 
capital expenditures of million in were primarily for computer equipment purchased to accommodate headcount growth and the upgrading of the employee computers to more fully utilize new software tools available 
net cash used for operations was million for the year ending december   including the million net loss for for the year ending december   net cash provided by operations was million 
unbilled revenue increased to million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in unbilled revenue was primarily related to an increase in the number of large contract sales and add on and upgrade sales to existing customers for software  hardware and services 
historically  the company s typical contract billing terms were based on completion of a series of events from contract execution through final acceptance  generally spanning six to twelve months  which did not coincide with the company s revenue recognition policy  resulting in unbilled revenues 
the company implemented a new billing policy during that is intended to better match the timing of the billing with recognition of revenue  which should reduce the level of unbilled revenue 
unbilled revenue at december  decreased million from june  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to realize such improvements in the future or that collections of amounts billed will occur as expected 
net cash used for operations attributed to accounts payable was million for the year ending compared to million provided to operations during the same period of the increased use of the cash for operations attributed to accounts payable resulted in a decrease in the total outstanding accounts payable due to vendors
