item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the measure of a company s ability to generate adequate funds to meet its needs 
funds can be generated internally from operations or externally by borrowing 
primary measures of liquidity include the amount of working capital  the working capital ratio and the ability to borrow funds 
as shown in the following chart  the company s ability to borrow funds remains strong as evidenced by the unused commitment for term financing and the unpledged notes and leases at december  working capital    working capital ratio to to to unused commitment for term financing of customer notes and leases    unpledged notes and leases    the decreases in working capital and working capital ratio in were largely the result of the ballon payment on the mortgage note  which is secured by the tank production facility and is due in october the company may elect to refinance this note on a long term basis if additional working capital is needed 
a substantial amount of the company s working capital over the past three years has been provided from operations 
long term borrowings of  in and  in were used to finance customer sales type leases or notes receivable for the purchase of steel tanks produced by the company s tank division  pursuant to the arrangements described under item business leasing and finance division

the total amounts borrowed with collateral under the lease and finance plans at december  were  and  respectively 
due to the seasonal nature of the operations of the company s chemical group and extension of fall payment terms in certain other divisions  the company has an uneven cash flow pattern 
operations of the chemical group begin approximately mid april and run through november 
there are substantial cash requirements in the second quarter for this division associated with inventory build up and the purchase of equipment and supplies 
since the majority of the contracts performed by this division are for political subdivisions and the contracts stretch over the entire summer season  a fair percentage of the payments are not received until mid september and october 
this creates a cash shortage from june to october which has made it necessary for the company to borrow short term funds 
for this reason  the company has arranged a short term borrowing line of  through local banks 
in the company used amounts ranging from month end amounts of  to  of its short term credit line

changes effective in state and local tax rates were largely responsible for the increase in the effective tax rate from in to in impact of inflation and changing prices on sales and income from operations the rate of inflation during recent years has again become a consideration and the company uses the following procedures to help offset its detrimental effects 
first  selling prices of the company s products are carefully and constantly scrutinized so that selling prices reflect current costs 
price increases can only be instituted  of course  to the extent that the company s prices remain competitive within the business segments in which the company operates 
as a result  the company constantly monitors alternative suppliers to assure the lowest possible costs 
the chemical group can reasonably account for inflation in bidding on fixed price contracts because a majority of the contracts are bid early in the year with completion dates during the current year 
labor rates are generally established prior to the bid and these are generally fixed for the duration of the contract 
materials necessary to perform a contract can be price protected by purchasing under early order programs or by purchasing sufficient quantities of the materials necessary to complete the contract at the time it is awarded 
this allows these costs to be considered at the time a bid is prepared 
the company uses the lifo method of accounting for the cost of goods sold for the majority of its products 
this charges current costs to the results of operations for both financial reporting and income tax purposes and during periods of inflation results in improved cash flow due to lower income taxes paid by providing a closer matching of revenues and expenses 
finally  increasing of productivity levels in all of the company s operating divisions has helped to lessen the effects of inflation in the past and will continue to be part of the company s objective for controlling the effects of inflation in the future
