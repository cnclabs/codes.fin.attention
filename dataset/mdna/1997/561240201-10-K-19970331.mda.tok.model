item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the company s historical consolidated financial position at december   and  and results of operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december  the company s historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
the financial information discussed below is consolidated information  which includes the accounts of laguna 
overview historically  the company has engaged in two separate and distinct facets of the natural resources business 
through mallon oil  the company has pursued its core oil and gas business 
through laguna  the company has engaged in mining activities 
by early  the company concluded that the level of capital and management resources required to fully develop each of these businesses made it inadvisable for the company to continue to pursue both 
accordingly  the company separated the businesses by establishing the financial independence of laguna and having the company focus its efforts on the oil and gas business 
laguna s recent canadian financing and listing on the toronto stock exchange were the key steps toward accomplishment of that goal and should permit laguna to operate independently without further reliance on the company for financial support 
the company does not have any obligation or intention to finance laguna s future operations 
in light of the recent implementation of this fundamental change in the manner in which the company will henceforth pursue its business  the company s past financial performance is not necessarily indicative of its future operations 
the company s revenues  profitability and future rate of growth will be substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and gas  which are in turn dependent upon numerous factors that are beyond the company s control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
the energy markets have historically been volatile  and there can be no assurance that oil and gas prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future 
a substantial or extended decline in oil or gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and access to capital  as well as the quantities of oil and gas reserves that the company may economically produce 
liquidity and capital resources in october  the company sold  shares of the company s common stock in a public offering 
the company received proceeds of approximately  net of offering costs of  until its october equity offering  the company had  since inception  been significantly constrained by a continued shortage of capital 
the october equity offering remedied that problem  at least for the foreseeable future 
for the first time in the company s history  the company has funds available to develop and exploit the company s substantial inventory of oil and gas properties 
management is of the view that the company s chronic liquidity problem can now be solved  on a long term basis  by the company s development of its oil and gas properties 
management believes that such operations will increase cash flow and improve liquidity  and thereby allow the company to avoid future working capital short falls 
the company had a working capital surplus of  at december  compared to a deficit of  at december  the increase in working capital at december  is primarily due to higher cash balances as a result of the equity offerings by the company and laguna in in march  the company established a  credit facility the facility with bank one  texas  na the bank 
the facility establishes two separate lines of credit a primary revolving line of credit the revolver and a line of credit to be used for development drilling approved by the bank the drilling line 
the borrowing base under the revolver is subject to redetermination every six months  or at such other times as the bank may determine 
the company is obligated to maintain certain financial and other covenants  including a minimum current ratio  minimum net equity  a debt coverage ratio and a total bank debt ceiling 
the facility is collateralized by substantially all of the company s oil and gas properties 
the facility expires march  the initial borrowing base under the revolver was  initial amounts drawn under the revolver were used to retire the amount outstanding under the company s prior line of credit of approximately  and related accrued interest 
at june   the borrowing base was redetermined and reduced to  at that time  the amount outstanding under the revolver was  or  in excess of the redetermined borrowing base 
per the amended terms of the facility  the company drew  under the drilling line and applied it to reduce amounts outstanding under the revolver to an amount below the redetermined borrowing base 
the  drawn under the drilling line and  under the revolver were repaid in october upon the completion of the public stock sale  discussed below 
once repaid  the company can no longer borrow against the drilling line 
at december   the borrowing base under the revolver was  and the principal amount outstanding was  leaving the amount available under the revolver at  effective january  the borrowing base was increased to  at march   the principal amount outstanding was  leaving the amount remaining available under the revolver at  the company is currently in compliance with the covenants of the facility 
for additional information concerning the facility  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
approximately  of the net proceeds from the company s october offering were used to purchase and retire all outstanding shares of the company s series a convertible preferred stock 
in may  laguna sold  special warrants for per warrant in a private placement for net proceeds of  in september  laguna completed the registration of the sale of the special warrants with the ontario canada securities commission 
mandatory redemption of the company s series b mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock the series b stock was to begin in april  when of the outstanding shares ie   shares were to be redeemed for  the company has extended an offer to all holders of the series b stock to convert their shares into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of  rather than the conversion price otherwise in effect 
on march   a holder of  shares of series b stock accepted the offer to convert 
when completed  this conversion will satisfy the company s obligation to redeem any shares in april 
historically  the company s involvement in both oil and gas and mining activities has hampered its ability to raise capital due to the complexity of the company s financial structure and apparent market perceptions that the company was too small to effectively pursue two such disparate businesses 
by establishing independent financing arrangements for laguna  management hopes to overcome these problems  and place the company in a position to exploit its oil and gas acreage 
the elimination of the company s commitment to fund laguna s operations should assist the company in these efforts 
to implement its planned drilling and development programs  the company expended  in and plans to spend approximately million in with the net proceeds of the equity offering  the company s working capital and credit facility and the operating cash flows that are expected to be generated by the application of such funds to the company s drilling program  management anticipates that the company will have sufficient capital to fund the continued development of its current properties and to meet the company s liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future

hedging activities the company uses hedging instruments to manage commodity price risks 
the company has used energy swaps and other financial arrangements to hedge against the effects of fluctuations in the sales prices for oil and natural gas 
gains and losses on such transactions are matched to product sales and charged or credited to oil and gas sales when that product is sold 
management believes that the use of various hedging arrangements can be a prudent means of protecting the company s financial interests from the volatility of oil and gas prices 
at december   the company had natural gas swaps in place covering an aggregate of  mmbtu per month of production at fixed prices ranging from to per mmbtu on an inside ferc basis  and oil swaps in place covering an aggregate of  bbls per month of production at fixed prices ranging from to on a nymex basis 
for the years ended december   and  the company s gains losses under its swap agreements were   and  respectively 
for further information about the company s energy swaps  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
miscellaneous the company s oil and gas operations are significantly affected by certain provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  that are applicable to the oil and gas industry 
current law permits the company to deduct currently  rather than capitalize  intangible drilling and development costs incurred or borne by it 
the company  as an independent producer  is also entitled to a deduction for percentage depletion with respect to the first  bbls per day of domestic crude oil and or equivalent units of domestic natural gas produced if such percentage depletion exceeds cost depletion 
generally  this deduction is of gross income from an oil and gas property  without reference to the taxpayer s basis in the property 
the percentage depletion deduction may not exceed of the taxable income from a given property 
further  percentage depletion is limited in the aggregate to of the company s taxable income 
any depletion disallowed under the limitation  however  may be carried over indefinitely 
inflation has not historically had a material impact on the company s financial statements  and management does not believe that the company will be materially more or less sensitive to the effects of inflation than other companies in the oil and gas industry
