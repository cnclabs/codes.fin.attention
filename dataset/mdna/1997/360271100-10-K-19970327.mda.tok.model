this ratio was for compared to for and for return on average shareholders equity roe  another measure of performance  increased in to from in and in the increase in earnings in was driven by growth in both net interest income and other income  offset somewhat by related increases in noninterest expenses 
net interest income net interest income is the most significant contributor to the corporation s net income 
during  net interest income increased to million compared to increases of and during and  respectively 
the comparative average balance sheets and net interest income analysis on page summarizes the components of the net interest income growth 
the increases in interest income and interest expense during were due mainly to growth in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities while average rates over the period remained fairly stable 
in  increases were a result of both rate and volume fluctuations

average loans increased million  million and million during  and  respectively 
a portion of this growth during and was due to the october  acquisition of cpfc 
the yield on interest earning assets decreased to in from in the slight decrease in the yield is primarily a result of the yield on loans declining by basis points  offset by an increase in yields on investments 
many of the corporation s loans are adjustable rate and  as such  the overall loan portfolio yield is influenced by changes in certain market indices  such as the prime rate 
the fulton bank prime rate declined from an average of in to in the yield on interest earning assets was higher than the yield in this increase is a result of two factors 
first  in  the yield on loans increased basis points to from in as the average prime rate increased from to 
secondly  a more significant change in the composition of interest earning assets occurred 
loans increased to of total interest earning assets from in since loans generally have a higher yield than investments  this shift also influenced overall yields

as competition for customer deposits has intensified over the past few years  the corporation has also turned to short term borrowings as an additional funding source 
in  short term borrowings increased million or over the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased slightly from for to for  after increasing from in the changes in the cost of funds primarily reflect fluctuations of the interest rate environment 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses for totaled million  compared to the and provisions of million and million  respectively

adjusting for a one time change in the method of recognizing income on certain employee benefit plans  the increase in income was in and in the growth during and was due to ongoing expansion and increased marketing of traditional trust services as well as the continued success of several innovative investment management products

the average number of full time equivalent employees remained constant at  for both and the corporation continued to improve salary efficiencies by reducing the ratio of employees to million dollars of average assets to in from in the corporation continues to evaluate its structure to improve operating efficiencies 
the increase in salaries and benefits expense in was a result of two primary factors

all of the corporation s bif insured deposits qualified for the lowest rate as its banks met the prescribed measures of strength 
the significant decline in expense was a direct result of this reduction 
effective january   the rate on the corporation s bif insured deposits was reduced from four basis points to zero  with a requirement for a minimum premium of  per institution 
however  these savings  which approximated million in  were offset by a special one time assessment on saif insured deposits 
on september   legislation was enacted to adequately fund the saif  which remained undercapitalized as a result of the savings and loan crisis in the late s 
the legislation called for a one time assessment on saif insured deposits 
the corporation s share of this assessment  which was expensed in the third quarter  was approximately million 
as a result of this special one time assessment  the saif became fully funded  and saif insurance rates were reduced to the bif levels 
this legislation also provided that the repayment of the financing corporation fico bonds  which had been issued to finance the thrift bailout  be shared by both banks and thrifts 
for the three year period beginning january   saif insured deposits will be assessed at an annual rate of while bif insured deposits will pay an assessment rate of 
beginning january   both bif and saif insured deposits will be assessed at an annual rate of 
for the corporation  the decrease in its saif assessment from basis points to basis points will be greater than the increase in its bif assessment from zero to basis points 
the corporation s fdic insurance expense calculated by applying the assessment rates to its year end deposit balances is expected to be approximately  special services expense  which represents the cost of data processing  increased  or during after increasing  or in and decreasing  or in the corporation has generally been able to control this cost by implementing and maintaining a common system for all subsidiaries under a corporate contract 
the and increases are due to growth in trust operations and loans  resulting in larger transaction volumes and costs 
in addition  the corporation outsourced student loan processing in  which increased this expense by approximately  other expenses increased million or during after increasing million or during expenses in this category include stationery and supplies  postage  audits  telecommunications  pennsylvania shares tax  advertising  insurance  legal fees and goodwill amortization

the table on page highlights the trends in the balance sheet over the past two years 
because annual averages tend to conceal trends and year end balances can be distorted by one day fluctuations  the december monthly averages for each year are provided to give a better indication of trends in the balance sheet 
all references within the discussion that follows are to such average balances unless specifically noted otherwise 
the corporation s assets continued to grow during  reaching the level of billion  an increase of million or as compared to the rate of growth for can be attributed to the continuing loan demand throughout the corporation s markets that resulted in loan growth of approximately million or for the year 
this loan growth was funded primarily through an increase in deposits and short term borrowings 
loans loans outstanding net of unearned income increased million or for  compared to a increase of million or 
demand for consumer credit again provided a significant share of loan growth during  increasing or 
the dramatic increase was largely due to the corporation expanding its indirect lending operations 
this expansion  coupled with continued high demand for automobiles  resulted in an installment loan increase of approximately million or 
also contributing to the increase in consumer loans were student loans increase of million or  credit cards increase of million or  and leasing increase of million or 
commercial loans and commercial mortgages continued to exhibit growth reflecting the strength of the economy 
these loans increased million or in  compared to an increase of million or in increases in both years were primarily in fixed rate categories  as customers sought to lock in the lower rates in effect throughout the two year period 
residential mortgage loans outstanding increased million or in  following a million or decrease in in general  the corporation s policy is to sell all conforming fixed rate residential mortgage production 
in  as mortgage rates continued to decline  fixed rate mortgages were refinanced by borrowers at lower rates and the corporation sold the new loans 
the fixed rate mortgage portfolio decreased million or as a result 
in  the refinance volume subsided  however new fixed rate loans continued to be popular and the production continued to be sold in the secondary market 
as a result  fixed rate mortgage balances remained stable in adjustable rate mortgages declined by in million as fixed rate loans remained preferable in the low rate environment 
investment securities investment securities decreased million or during  compared to an increase of million or during during both years  a portion of the proceeds from maturities and sales was used to fund loan growth rather than reinvestment in securities 
in recent years  the corporation has increased its investments in mortgage backed securities 
these securities have provided higher returns over similarly rated conventional securities 
as of december   the corporation had mortgage backed securities in its portfolio with an amortized cost of million as compared to million at december  the corporation s investment in equity securities was million amortized cost basis at year end  of which million represents holdings of stock issued by the federal home loan bank fhlb 
as of december   all subsidiary banks were members of the fhlb and therefore eligible for its funding programs 
the corporation continues to follow an equity securities investment strategy of seeking and maintaining long term investment positions in regional financial institutions which in management s view represent solid investment value 
investments in tax exempt municipal securities decreased to million at december  from million at the end of this continued decrease reflects the effect of the tax reform act of  which sharply reduced the tax benefit of the majority of tax exempt securities acquired subsequent to its passage and thus reduced the corporation s incentive to invest in them 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities requires that all investment securities be classified as either i held to maturity  ii available for sale  or iii a trading security 
the corporation possesses both the intent  subject to credit impairment  and ability to hold each debt security in its investment portfolio to maturity 
management does  however  recognize the portfolio to be an important potential source of liquidity 
therefore at december   million or amortized cost basis of the portfolio was classified as available for sale 
this compares to million or classified as available for sale at december  debt securities are classified as available for sale upon purchase primarily based upon liquidity considerations 
all equity securities are classified as available for sale since the corporation does not engage in trading activities 
at december   securities available for sale had an estimated fair value of million and an amortized cost of million compared to an estimated fair value of million and an amortized cost of million at december  the increase in the aggregate unrealized appreciation reflects the effect of decreasing interest rates on the market value of fixed rate securities within this portfolio  as well as the favorable performance of the corporation s equity portfolio  offset by the gains realized during at december   securities held to maturity had an estimated fair value of million   below their amortized cost  compared to an estimated fair value of million  million above their amortized cost at december  short term investments  which include federal funds sold  money market investments and interest bearing deposits with other banks  have decreased over the past several years in order to fund loan growth 
short term investments decreased million during after increasing million during other assets noninterest earning assets increased million or in after decreasing million or in the increase was due mainly to new expenditures for premises and equipment 
the decrease primarily reflects a million decrease in transaction balances maintained with correspondent banks and vault cash 
during  the corporation restructured its check clearing procedures and switched this function to a different correspondent bank  thereby reducing required cash balances capital expenditures on premises and equipment totaled million during  compared to million and million during and  respectively 
the increases in capital expenditures reflect additional investments in technology to strengthen the corporation s competitive position in its markets 
in  the corporation completed the implementation of an automated platform system at fulton bank that provided each branch with the ability to more effectively and efficiently service customers and enhanced the ability to cross sell bank products 
the corporation anticipates that this system will be implemented at additional subsidiary banks over the next several years 
expansion of the branch office network of bank subsidiaries continued during the year 
during  the corporation continued its participation in affordable housing and community development projects through investments in partnerships 
equity commitments totaling million were made to two new projects 
the corporation made its initial investment of this type during and is now involved in projects  all located in the various communities served by its subsidiary banks 
the carrying value of such investments was approximately million at december  with these investments  the corporation not only improves the quantity and quality of available housing for low and moderate income individuals in its service area in support of its subsidiary bank s community reinvestment act compliance effort  but also becomes eligible for tax credits under federal and  in some instances  state programs 
deposits asset growth has been funded partially through growth in deposits 
during  deposits increased million or to billion 
in  deposits increased million or 
deposit activity in the last few years has not kept pace with loan growth as a result of increased competition for consumer savings dollars from non banks and other financial institutions 
interest bearing deposits grew million or in compared to growth of million or in savings deposits  including money market deposit accounts  decreased million or following a million or decrease during these decreases reflect the movement of customer funds into time deposit products  which the affiliate banks have aggressively marketed 
time deposits increased million or during after increasing million or in short term certificates of deposit  those with initial maturities of less than two years  saw the majority of the growth during million or increase 
this increase was a result of the corporation identifying this customer preference and marketing these products with promotional rates 
noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts continued to grow during and  increasing million or and million or  respectively 
borrowings short term borrowings  consisting of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements  and treasury  tax and loan notes  increased million or in after decreasing million or in the increase over the past year is attributable primarily to the use of fed funds purchased to meet customer loan demand in the face of lower deposit growth  and the continuing flow of corporate funds from deposit accounts into repurchase agreements due to the availability of higher returns 
federal funds purchased increased from million in to million in in  federal funds purchased decreased million or 
during and  repurchase agreements increased million or and million or  respectively 
long term debt increased million or during after increasing million or during during and  the corporation took advantage of certain fhlb funding programs 
fhlb advances represent the majority of the long term debt balances 
shareholders equity shareholders equity continued to be an important funding source  providing a funding level of million  an increase of million or from the million provided in in spite of increasing dividends  the corporation maintained a strong rate of internal capital generation and in and  respectively 
this internal capital generation is dependent upon strong earnings performance in conjunction with a prudent dividend policy  represented by payout ratios of for and for liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management the goals of the corporation s asset liability management function are to ensure adequate liquidity and to maintain an appropriate balance between the relative rate sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management encompasses the ability to meet the ongoing cash flow requirements of customers  who  as depositors  may want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
interest rate sensitivity management attempts to provide stable net interest margins through changing interest rate environments and thereby achieve consistent growth in net interest income 
liquidity sources are found on both sides of the balance sheet 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal reductions and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments 
liquidity is also provided through the availability of deposits and borrowings 
at december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  securities available for sale  and non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due in one year or less totaled million or of total assets 
this represents an increase from the december  total of million or of total assets 
liquidity is also provided by non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due from one to five years  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
scheduled and unscheduled principal payments received on the held to maturity mortgage backed securities portfolio also provides liquidity 
the corporation had million of such mortgage backed securities at december  and million at december  the corporation s practice is to purchase mortgage backed securities with relatively accurately defined principal repayment schedules of short duration 
the loan portfolio provides an additional source of liquidity due to the corporation s ability to participate in the secondary mortgage market 
sales of residential mortgages into the secondary market of million and million in and  respectively  provided the necessary funding which allowed the corporation to meet the needs of its customers for new mortgage financing 
from a funding standpoint  the corporation has been able to rely over the years on a stable base of core deposits 
even though the corporation has experienced notable changes in the composition and interest sensitivity of this deposit base  it has been able to rely on the steady growth of this base to provide needed liquidity 
the corporation also has access to sources of large denomination or jumbo time deposits and repurchase agreements as potential sources of liquidity 
however  the corporation has attempted to minimize its reliance upon these more volatile short term funding sources and to use them primarily to meet the requirements of its existing customer base or when it is profitable to do so 
each of the corporation s subsidiary banks are members of the federal home loan bank  which provides them access to fhlb overnight and term credit facilities 
at december   the corporation had million in term advances from the fhlb with an additional million of borrowing capacity including both short term funding on its lines of credit and long term borrowings 
this availability  along with federal funds lines at various correspondent commercial banks  provides the corporation with additional liquidity 
interest rate sensitivity varies widely with different types of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
at the short end of the asset spectrum are overnight federal funds  on which rates change daily  and loans  whose rates float with the prime rate or a similar index 
at the other end are long term investment securities and fixed rate loans 
on the liability side  jumbo time deposits and short term borrowings are much more interest rate sensitive than passbook savings and fhlb advances 
while the interest rate sensitivity gap the difference between repricing opportunities available for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities must be managed over all time horizons  the corporation focuses on the month period as the key interval affecting net interest income 
this shorter period is monitored because a large percentage of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are subject to repricing or maturity within this period 
in addition  short term interest rate swings can be more pronounced and provide a shorter time for reaction or strategy adjustment 
the following is a summary of the interest sensitivity gaps for four different time intervals as of december  daily adjustable days days days gap cumulative gap the corporation s policy provides for the month cumulative gap to be maintained between 
and 
the corporation was positioned within this range throughout and as of december  common stock as of december   the corporation had  shares of par value common stock outstanding held by  shareholders 
the common stock of the corporation is traded on the national market system of the national association of securities dealers automated quotation system nasdaq under the symbol fult
