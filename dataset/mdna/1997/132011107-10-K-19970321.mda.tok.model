years ended december  gross sales net revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating profit interest expense other income expense  net net income the company s product mix has changed substantially over the periods indicated  principally as a result of acquisitions 
the following tables show the gross sales of the company s five product categories  in dollars and as a percentage of the company s total gross sales for the years ended december   and  as well as the gross profit by product category for and years ended december  gross sales pharmaceutical bulk actives    pharmaceutical intermediates    organic intermediates    performance enhancers    polymer systems    total gross sales    total net revenues    total gross profit    years ended december  gross sales distribution pharmaceutical bulk actives pharmaceutical intermediates organic intermediates performance enhancers polymer systems dollars in thousands  except share data gross sales gross profit by product category gross gross gross sales profit profit pharmaceutical bulk actives   pharmaceutical intermediates   organic intermediates   performance enhancers   polymer systems   gross gross gross sales profit profit pharmaceutical bulk actives   pharmaceutical intermediates   organic intermediates   performance enhancers   polymer systems   compared to gross sales in were at the same level as increases in performance enhancers and pharmaceutical intermediates were offset by lower sales in our organic intermediates and polymer systems product categories 
pharmaceutical bulk actives were at the same level as pharmaceutical bulk actives of  were at the same level as increases in the cardiovascular product group of  and respiratory bulk actives of  offset decreases in gastro intestinal of  anti inflammatory bulk actives of and the other bulk actives of  gastro intestinal bulk actives were  a decrease of from this decrease is mainly attributable to sulfasalazine mesalamine  used to treat ulcerative colitis  as a major customer had high inventories in the last quarter of and did not reorder until the second quarter cardiovascular bulk actives were  an increase of  from the key products in this total included diltiazem hcl  amiodarone hcl  isosorbide mononitrate  sotalol hcl and acebutolol hcl 
the increase is mainly due to the sales of amiodarone hcl  used as an anti arithmic  in new countries as well as to new customers in respiratory actives were  an increase of  from the key product in this category is cromoglycate sodium which had increased due to increased demand in us markets 
central nervous system bulk actives of  were at the same level as  and included bromazepan  alprazolam and lorazepam among products 
anti inflammatory bulk actives were  a decrease from included among products are ketoprofen  magnesium salicyliate for backache formulas and naproxen sodium 
other bulk actives were  a decrease of  from  and included items for endocrine  diuretics  anti infective  immunology and various other uses 
one product decreased  due to a lack of availability of raw materials for production in  but is expected to return to levels in dollars in thousands  except share data pharmaceutical intermediates of  were  above 
cosmetic products increased and x ray media products increased  offsetting the decreases in other pharmaceutical intermediates of and health products of health products of  decreased by from in various products  including niacinamide usp and pyridine 
x ray media products  which include nipa compounds  of  increased  with the largest increase  from one of our us facilities  due to a shift in production by a major customer in from europe to the us cosmetic products of  were above due to higher sales of our proprietary naturechem product line 
other pharmaceutical intermediates of  decreased due to the effect of the loss of the pmpa contract and reduced demand for dextromethorphan intermediates used in over the counter cough suppresants  offset by the initial sales of an advanced intermediate of a new protease inhibitor for aids treatment 
organic intermediates of  were  below 
the feed additives category decreased  and offset the increases in crop protection of  and pigments of  feed additives of  decreased  due to reduced pricing and increased competition in the feed grade vitamin b markets 
sales of organo arsenical feed additives  the largest product in feed additives  was down from due to escalated grain prices and increased price competition to end users 
crop protection intermediates of  increased  from the increase was due to the renegotiation of a contract for a pyridine derivative used in the manufacture of herbicides in the first quarter however  pyridine  which is the largest product in crop protection  was down from  due to a major customer purchasing at levels after two years and at above contract levels 
pigments intermediates of  increased  from  due to the gain in market share of pnba  a pigment used in dyes and uv protection agents 
performance enhancers of  were  above 
specialty additives increased  photographic products increased and polymer products increased from catalysts decreased  and fuel oil products decreased specialty additives of  increased  from the key increase was the sales of pyridine derivatives to world markets and customers not previously served 
catalysts products of  decreased  from this decrease is primarily attributable to lower demand for various catalysts sold by one of our us facilities in the dextromethorphan markets 
polymer products of  increased over the increase was a crosslinking agent to improve the performance of polycarbonate resins  due to wider usage of the product by a major customer 
photographic products of  increased from due to a customer requiring additional inventory of a polymer used in instant film in the first quarter fuel oil products of  decreased from the decrease was in castor based products used in grease applications 
polymer systems of  were  below  telecommunications decreased  and was partially offset by coatings which increased  and biomedicals of engineering plastics were at the same level as dollars in thousands  except share data telecommunications of  decreased  from primarily as a result of the company s strategic decision to no longer provide product to at t 
coatings of  increased  from due to the sales of castor based products to a major coatings manufacturer 
biomedicals of  increased from due to both increased demand of end use products and increased pricing 
export sales from us businesses were at  compared with  in international sales  comprised of all sales from our operations in europe  totalled  as compared with  in during  the pmpa contract with our us facility in zeeland  michigan was terminated prematurely by the customer 
a settlement had been agreed upon that entitles the company to payments in and for the next three years 
accordingly  the company recognized income  net of related costs  of approximately  during total gross profit in increased to  resulting in a higher gross margin percentage of of gross sales compared with in the gross margin increase was due to an improved product mix of sales  production efficiencies  and increased plant throughput  in line with management s continued focus on higher performing  more profitable product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross sales were in  down from in the expense of  was  below primarily due to lower legal and environment costs 
such reductions are the result of recoveries from third parties and reserve reversals that exceeded our outlays related to remediation programs in the company conducts periodic reviews of its environmental and litigation matters  prepares estimates of the range of potential future costs of each matter wherever possible  and adjusts the accruals for environmental contingencies as circumstances warrant 
in  this accrual was reduced by  to reflect our remaining estimated exposure 
research and development expenses of  were of gross sales in  and represented a increase from a portion of this increase was due to costs associated with the oxford asymmetry contract of  the operating profit in increased to  from  in due to the improved gross margins and the aforementioned reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses 
net interest expense of  in reflected a decrease of  from the decrease was due to strong cash flow and to the decreased outstanding debt as a result of the equity offering in mid the interest rate in was compared to in other income in was compared with other expense of  in the difference included foreign currency transaction gains versus currency losses in the provision for income taxes for resulted in an effective rate of versus in the company recorded a  reversal of tax reserves as a result of a settlement with the internal revenue service related to audits for the years through during january  the company implemented tax strategies which  based upon projected domestic and international taxable income  should have a favorable impact on the effective tax rate for and beyond 
however  actual results could differ in the event of changes in tax regulations or deviations in projections 
the company s net income increased to  compared with a net income of  in primarily due to increased margins and reduced selling  general and administrative expenses and interest 
dollars in thousands  except share data compared to gross sales in increased  over increases occurred in all phases of the business with key increases in pharmaceutical bulk actives which added  and pharmaceutical intermediates  pharmaceutical bulk actives of  were  above nordic profarmaco increased  the sales of magnesium salicyliate the active ingredient in backache formulas accounted for the rest of the increase gastro intestinal bulk actives were  this category is mainly sulfasalazine mesalamine  made in bulk in the us and at nordic  which are used to treat ulcerative colitis

other bulk actives were  and included items for respiratory system  diuretics  anti infective  immunology and various other uses 
all had higher sales than due to the nordic profarmaco acquisition 
pharmaceutical intermediates of  were  above 
nordic profarmaco increased  and excluding the nordic profarmaco increase health decreased  cosmetic decreased  x ray media increased  and other pharmaceutical intermediates increased  health products of  increased with nordic increasing  and all other business decreasing  due to two discontinued product lines citrates and hydrogels  partially offset by higher pyridine sales of x ray media products  which include nipa compounds of  increased  with nordic increasing  and all other businesses increasing cosmetic products of  decreased  from due to sale of the wickhen product line in  in reduced sales 
other pharmaceutical intermediates of  increased  with nordic increasing  and all the other businesses increasing  this increase was due to sales of the two intermediates used in the formulation of dextromethorphan  an over the counter cough suppressant  increase  and mandelic acid  increase 
organic intermediates of  were  above 
nordic increased  in this category 
excluding the effect of nordic  crop protection intermediates increased  and feed additives increased the pigment intermediates were all nordic business 
feed additives of  increased due in part to improved pricing of feed grade vitamin b sales of organo arsenical feed additives  the largest product in feed additives  remained at levels 
crop protection intermediates of  increased  from the increase was due to greater off take of pyridine derivatives used in the manufacture of herbicides 
pyridine  which is the largest product in crop protection  was at the level 
dollars in thousands  except share data pigments intermediates of  increased  from due to the full year effect of the nordic acquisition 
these intermediates are used in various industrial products including inks  dyes and color additives 
performance enhancers of  were  above 
nordic increased  excluding the nordic increase photographic products decreased from levels  catalysts increased  specialty additives increased  fuel oil products increased  and polymer products increased  specialty additives of  increased  from this includes nordic s sales increase of  other increases include castor oil based products 
catalysts products of  increased  from this increase includes nordic s added sales of  and increases in various other catalysts of polymer products of  increased  over the key increases were products used as a crosslinking agent to improve the performance of polycarbonate resins  as a dye receptor in acrylic fibers for textiles  and an anti oxidant used in plastics 
photographic products of  decreased from mainly due to reduced sales of a polymer used in instant film  due to a customer continuing to reduce inventory levels in refer to the form k 
fuel oil products of  increased over key increase was in various alkenyl succinic anhydrides asa s used in rust inhibitors  and fuel and oil detergents 
polymer systems of  were  above engineering plastics increased  from and helped to offset reductions in coatings of and telecommunications of  biomedicals of  were at the same level as telecommunications of  decreased  from due to reduced encapsulant sales 
this reduction was the result of good weather  and declining applications  as domestic customers replace cable lines with fiber optics 
coatings of  decreased from due to reduced sales to paint manufacturers 
engineering plastics of  increased  from this increase was due to the growing demand for a product used in high performance polysulfone engineering plastics in electronic and industrial applications  such as computer and television screens  and automobile parts 
export sales from us businesses increased to  from  in international sales  comprised of all sales from our acquired operations in europe  totaled  as compared with  in total gross profit of  increased by  or  from this was due to the increased sales and higher gross margin percentage which increased to of gross sales from in the gross margin increase was due to an improved product mix of sales  reduced cost for major raw materials which affected the margin  and price increases gained in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross sales was in  up from in the expense of  was  above the increased operating expenses of acquisitions made in accounted for most of the increase 
other increases included bonus accruals of  periodically  the company conducts a comprehensive review of its environmental and litigation issues  prepares estimates of the range of potential costs of each issue wherever possible  and adjusts the accruals for environmental contingencies as circumstances warrant 
there were no provisions made in or a discussion of such matters is included in the footnotes to the financial statements 
dollars in thousands  except share data research and development expenses were of gross sales in  and represented a decrease from research and development spending increased to  from  in the acquisitions accounted for all of this increase 
the operating profit in increased to  from  in the increased operating profits were due to the full year effect of acquisitions and to increased gross margins 
net interest expense of  in reflected an increase of  from the increase was due to  in financing activities necessary for the acquisitions of seal sands and nordic profarmaco 
additionally  the interest rate in was compared to in the provision for income taxes for resulted in an effective rate of versus in the rate increased due to the mix of income between international and domestic subsidiaries 
other expense in was  compared with other income of in the difference included currency losses at nordic and profarmaco  as well as the writedowns of the carrying value of equipment no longer in use 
the company s net income increased to  compared with a net income of  in compared to gross sales in increased  due to the seal sands acquisition and the nordic profarmaco acquisition  and to increased sales of animal feed additives in organic intermediates 
the table below shows the contribution of the acquisitions to the product categories and the changes in the continuing business 
years ended december  acquired base businesses business pharmaceutical bulk actives     pharmaceutical intermediates     organic intermediates     performance enhancers     polymer systems     gross sales     includes seal sands  nordic and profarmaco acquisitions 
pharmaceutical bulk actives revenues of  increased  
the increase included  from the nordic profarmaco acquisition and from increased sales from a generic drug for ulcerative colitis  which recovered from depressed levels in the nordic profarmaco acquisition increased the pharmaceutical bulk actives category and includes products for cardiovascular  gastro intestinal  central nervous system and other actives for the anti infective  respiratory  endocrine  anti inflammatory  immunology  and other bulk actives markets 
gastro intestinal bulk actives increased  over to  profarmaco sales were  and the increase of  from the base business was from the sales of a generic drug for ulcerative colitis 
pharmaceutical intermediates revenues of  increased  over the increase included nordic profarmaco sales of  and increases in the other pharmaceutical intermediates  primarily intermediates used in cough suppressants 
dollars in thousands  except share data sales of health intermediates represented  or  of this category s gross revenues and were  lower than the main decrease of  in sales was due to the end of a contract to make citrates at the company s zeeland  michigan facility 
reduced shipments of vitamin b due to price competition and reduced sales of pyridine based products due to reduced pricing and lower sales volume to a key customer  were offset by higher sales of a starch modifier 
sales of cosmetic intermediates represented  or  of this category s gross revenues and were higher than in the fourth quarter of  the wickhen line of cosmetic products was sold 
sales of x ray media represented  or  of this category s gross revenues and were  above this increase is due to the acquisition of nordic in sales of other pharmaceutical intermediates represented  or  of this category s gross revenues and were  higher than the key increase of existing business was due to growth in two intermediates for dextromethorphan  an over the counter cough suppressant 
growth for one intermediate  an established product  was supplemented by sales under a contract for a second intermediate used in the synthesis of this material 
organic intermediates revenues of  increased  
this increase included  of new products from nordic and  of increases from the company s existing feed additive business 
the sales of animal feed additives were  or  of this category s revenues  up  from sales of organo arsenical feed additives used to control disease and to enhance chicken growth and improve feed performance  increased over the prior year due to growth in poultry production coupled with the customer s penetration of domestic and international markets 
all sales of this product are made to alpharma under a long term contract 
sales of feed grade vitamin b increased due to the installation of new packaging facilities late in which allowed penetration of non us markets 
shipments of vitamin b intermediates to india and the asia pacific area also increased 
while volume increased  the feed grade vitamin b market experienced lower prices due to competitive pricing  adversely affecting margins on these products 
prices were increased in the fourth quarter and are anticipated to increase in the first quarter  although no assurances can be given that such price increases will occur 
sales of crop protection intermediates used in the manufacture of herbicides and insecticides amounted to  or of this category s gross revenues and remained at the sales level 
sales of pyridine  the largest item in this group  were up from the largest pyridine customer is zeneca  inc who uses it in herbicide manufacture 
the company produces another major pyridine compound and is the exclusive supplier of this product to dow elanco who uses it in production of a different herbicide 
sales of this compound decreased in due to the customer reducing inventory levels after very high customer production in sales of other pyridine derivatives in this category increased from due to competitive pressures 
pigment intermediates represented  or  of this category s revenues 
these products are all produced by nordic 
performance enhancers revenues of  increased  
this increase included  in sales from the seal sands acquisition 
sales of specialty additives represented  or  of this category s revenues and were lower than this was due to a reduction in castor based products 
sales of catalyst products represented  or  of this category s revenues and were  higher than the increase is primarily attributable to tin based catalysts used in various industrial applications

in existing operations  increases occurred in an application for a product used as a dye receptor in acrylic yarns 
sales of photographic chemical products were  or  of this category s revenues   lower than the decrease was in sales of a polymer used in instant film  due to our customer reaching their desired inventory levels 
sales of products to the fuel oil industries represented  or  of this category s revenues and were  higher than polymer systems revenues of  increased  
this increase included  in sales from the seal sands acquisition of a product used in the manufacture of high performance plastics and represented of their sales 
telecommunications products represented  or  of this category s sales  and was on the same level as higher product sales to the electronics industry was offset by lower sales of encapsulants 
coatings products represented  or  of this category s sales  and was  higher than this increase was mainly due to a growth in castor based products used in coatings for the housing and automotive industries 
engineering plastics represented  or  of this category s sales  and included  in sales from our seal sands facility for a product used in high performance plastics 
biomedical products represented  or  of this category s sales  and was higher than  due to increased foreign market share 
export sales increased by  or  to  exports were of gross revenues in versus in international sales  comprised of all sales from our acquired operations in europe  totaled  total gross profit of  increased by  or  from the increased gross profit was principally due to the nordic profarmaco and seal sands acquisitions  and to sales increases in health and pharmaceuticals and agricultural intermediates and additives 
the gross profit as a percent of gross sales declined from in to in without the acquisition of nordic profarmaco  the gross profit percent would have been in loss of margin was principally due to sales price decreases and raw material price increases in the pyridine and related businesses  and higher manufacturing costs due to weather related problems in the first quarter selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross sales was in  down from in the expense of  was  above the increased operating expenses of the new acquisitions were mostly offset by reduced spending  including staff reductions  reduced legal costs  and lower environmental provisions 
periodically  the company conducts a comprehensive review of its environmental and litigation issues  prepares estimates of the range of potential costs of each issue wherever possible  and adjusts the accruals for environmental contingencies as circumstances warrant 
no additional environmental provision was recorded in the provision was  a discussion of such matters is included in the footnotes to the financial statements 
a settlement with insurance companies relating to coverage of environmental remediation costs allowed us to recover  of legal expenses spent in and  pursuing this recovery 
research and development expenses of  were of gross sales in  and represented a decrease from decreased spending at our harriman and bayonne facilities were offset by increased spending to our other domestic facilities and at our newly acquired sites in england  sweden and italy 
this dollars in thousands  except share data was consistent with our strategic focus on the health and pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals product categories 
the operating profit in increased to  from  in the increased operating profits were due to the acquisition of nordic profarmaco  and to cost reductions in selling  general and administration  and in research and development 
net interest expense of  in reflected an increase of  from the increase was due to  in financing activities necessary for the acquisitions of seal sands and nordic profarmaco and higher interest rates 
other income in was compared with other expense of in the difference included currency gains at profarmaco 
the provision for income taxes for resulted in an effective rate of versus in the company s net income increased to  compared with a net income of  in liquidity and capital resources net cash flow from operations was  for the year ended december  compared with  in the increase in cash flow is primarily due to increased earnings and additional depreciation  as well as reductions in accounts receivables and inventories 
capital expenditures were  in   in  and  in the largest expenditures in include the purchase of the headquarters office building by profarmaco and the construction of the tolterodine facility by nordic 
in addition  two of our us operations have started construction on pilot plants which incorporate cgmp capabilities 
these facilities are expected to be completed in on september   the company entered into a  loan agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders the banks and with nbd bank  na  as agent 
the credit agreement provided for i a one year  bridge loan  due october   ii a  term loan  with mandatory  quarterly payments until september  and mandatory quarterly payments of  for each quarter thereafter until september   and iii a  revolving credit facility  due october  the revolving credit facility will be extended for successive two year periods subsequent to october  unless either the company or the banks elect not to so extend the facility 
the facility has been extended through october  the credit agreement permits the company to choose from various interest rate options and to specify the portion of the borrowing to be covered by each interest rate option 
it also contains various restrictive covenants  which require the company to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth level  certain financial ratios and deferred pledge of assets  as defined in the credit agreement 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate long term obligations 
as of december   the company had outstanding four interest rate swap agreements  having a total notional amount of  those agreements effectively change the company s interest rate exposure from variable rate to fixed percentage 
on october   the company borrowed  and pound sterling  under the credit agreement to repay all of its obligations under the old credit agreement  and the old credit agreement was terminated 
on october   the company borrowed  under the credit agreement  including all of the  bridge loan facility and all of the  seven year term loan  to finance the acquisition of nordic and profarmaco 
on july   the company raised  in a public offering  which was used to pay down outstanding debt  short term bridge loan   long term 
dollars in thousands  except share data the company has undrawn borrowing capacity of approximately  under the credit agreement as of december   which can be used for general corporate purposes 
management is of the opinion that these amounts  together with other available sources of capital  are adequate for meeting the company s financing and capital requirements 
effective july   the board of directors approved a three for two split of the company s common stock  
par value  in the form of a stock dividend for holders of record on july  after giving effect to a three for two stock split approved by the company s board of directors on july   the company paid cash dividends of per share in a regular cash dividend has been declared by the board of directors on the company s common stock since the fourth quarter  the company buys materials and sells products in a variety of currencies in various parts of the world 
its results are therefore impacted by changes in the relative value of currencies in which it deals 
prior to the acquisition of nordic and profarmaco  this risk was not considered to be significant and the company had no program to mitigate foreign currency risk 
the company s primary market risk relates to exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by our foreign operations which are primarily denominated in the us dollar  deutsche mark and british pound sterling 
the company uses foreign currency forward exchange and put and call option contracts to mitigate the effect of short term foreign exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
the notional amount of these contracts is  which the company estimates to be approximately of the foreign currency exposure during the period covered resulting in a deferred currency gain of at december  an additional  of the foreign currency exposure is protected through export financing 
environmental the company maintains environmental and industrial safety and health compliance programs at its plants  and believes that its manufacturing operations are in general compliance with all applicable safety  health and environmental laws 
through the activities of its predecessors and third parties in connection with the handling and disposal of hazardous and other wastes  the company may become liable  irrespective of fault  for certain site remediation costs under federal and state environmental statutes 
descriptions of such environmentally related contingencies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements and incorporated herein by reference 
during january  an opinion was rendered against cosan  inc a subsidiary of cambrex by the district court of new jersey in a matter that has been pending since the opinion states that cosan contributed to contamination at a site in clifton  new jersey which was previously owned and operated by cosan 
pursuant to the opinion  cosan is liable for past environmental investigation and remediation costs approximating plus interest  as well as future remediation costs of the site 
in addition  treble damages on all past and future costs  plus interest  were assessed against cosan 
cosan intends to appeal this opinion with the district court of new jersey and believes that the treble damages component of the opinion are unprecedented 
the estimated range of costs for this case has been considered in the company s year end reserve assessment 
the resolution of such matters often spans several years and frequently involves regulatory oversight and or adjudication 
additionally  many remediation requirements are not fixed and are likely to be affected by future technological  site and regulatory developments 
consequently  the ultimate extent of liabilities with respect to such matters as well as the timing of related cash disbursements cannot be determined with certainty 
however  management is of the opinion that while the ultimate liability resulting from these matters may have a material effect upon the results of operations in any given year  they will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s liquidity nor its financial position 
dollars in thousands  except share data impact of recent accounting pronouncements the aicpa s statement of position environmental remediation liabilities requires that environmental remediation liabilities including related legal costs be accrued when it is probable that an environmental remediation will be required and such remediation efforts can be reasonably estimated 
the company is required to adopt this standard in the company currently considers the criteria of this standard in establishing its environmental liabilities with the exception of the requirement to accrue for certain future external legal costs 
the company anticipates that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its result of operations
