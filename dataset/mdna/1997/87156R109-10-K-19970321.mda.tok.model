item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview synaptic pharmaceutical corporation is a biotechnology company engaged in the development of a broad platform of enabling technology which it calls human receptor targeted drug design technology 
it is utilizing this technology both to discover and clone the genes that code for human receptor subtypes associated with specific disorders and to design compounds that can potentially be developed as drugs for treating these disorders 
the company is engaged in collaborations with four pharmaceutical companies eli lilly and company  merck and co  inc  novartis pharma ag and the dupont merck pharmaceutical company 
since inception  the company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and through funds provided by its collaborative partners lilly  merck and novartis under collaborative agreements 
under its collaborative agreements  the company may receive one or two types of revenue from its collaborative partners contract revenue and license revenue 
contract revenue includes research funding to support a specified number of the company s scientists and payments upon the achievement of specified research and development milestones 
research funding revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the agreement to which it relates and is based upon predetermined funding requirements 
research milestone payment revenue is recognized when the related research milestone is achieved 
license revenue represents non refundable payments for licenses to the company s technology and drug discovery systems 
non refundable payments for licenses are recognized at such time as they are received or  if earlier  become guaranteed 
in addition to contract revenue  if a drug is developed as a result of any of the collaborative agreements between the company and its collaborative partners  the company is entitled to receive royalty payments based upon the sale of such drugs 
the company also receives revenues from government grants under the small business innovative research sbir program of the national institutes of health 
to date  the company s expenditures have been for research and development related expenses  general and administrative related expenses  fixed asset purchases and various patent related expenditures incurred in protecting the company s technologies 
the company has been historically unprofitable and had an accumulated deficit of  at december  the company expects to continue to incur operating losses for a significant number of years and may not become profitable  if at all  until it begins to receive royalty revenue 
to date  the company has not received any royalty revenue and does not expect to receive such revenue for a significant number of years  if at all 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december   and revenues 
the company recognized revenue of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the increase of  from to was attributable primarily to the recognition of  of license revenue from one of the company s collaborative partners in and an increase of approximately  of grant revenue over the comparable period in  both of which were partially offset by a decrease in contract revenue of approximately  this decrease in contract revenue was attributable to the receipt in of a one time  payment from one of the company s collaborative partners for the achievement of a specific scientific milestone that was partially offset by increases in in the rates charged to the company s collaborative partners per full time equivalent scientist 
the increase of  from to was attributable primarily to an increase in contract revenue of  the increase in contract revenue was primarily due to the recognition of five months of research funding from novartis in as compared to twelve months of such funding in as well as the receipt of a  payment from one of the company s collaborators for the achievement of a specific scientific milestone 
grant revenue increased from  in to  in research and development expenses 
the company incurred research and development expenses of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the increase of  in research and development expenses from to was attributable primarily to an increase of approximately  in compensation expense resulting from an increase in average headcount year to year  annual salary and bonus increases and an associated increase in fringe benefit expense  as well as an increase in amortization of deferred compensation  an increase in approximately  in research supply costs  an increase of approximately  in research equipment costs related to research funded by government grants  approximately  in increased depreciation expense  and an increase of approximately  in software license fees 
the increase of  in research and development expenses from to was attributable primarily to an increase of approximately  resulting from an increase in average headcount year to year as well as annual salary and bonus increases and an associated increase in fringe benefit expense  an increase of approximately  in research supply cost  and an increase of approximately  related to depreciation of fixed assets as well as amortization of patents  all of which were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  due to the assumption by one of the company s collaborative partners in of certain preclinical testing activities 
general and administrative expenses 
the company incurred general and administrative expenses of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the increase of  in general and administrative expenses from to was attributable primarily to an increase of approximately  in expenses associated with being a public company  an increase of approximately  in compensation expense resulting from an increase in average headcount and annual salary and bonus increases and an associated increase in fringe benefit expense  an increase of approximately  in patent and patent related costs  and an increase of approximately  in certain supply and computer related expenses 
the increase of  in general and administrative expenses from to was attributable primarily to an increase of approximately  in rent expense resulting from the full year cost of an additional  square feet of space which was leased in august  and an increase of approximately  in compensation expense resulting from an average headcount increase as well as annual salary and bonus increases and an associated increase in fringe benefit expense 
other income  net 
the company received other income  net of interest expense  of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the increases of  from to and of  from to in other income  net of interest expense  were primarily attributable to an increase in interest income as a result of an increase in the average cash  cash equivalent and marketable security balances maintained during the three years 
net loss 
the net loss incurred by the company was   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the decrease of  in net loss from to was attributable primarily to the increase in revenue and other income  offset by higher research and development and general and administrative expenses 
the decrease of  in net loss from to was attributable primarily to the increase in revenue and other income  offset by higher research and development and general and administrative expenses 
net loss per share and supplementary net loss per share 
the net loss per share incurred by the company was and for the fiscal years of and  respectively 
the supplementary net loss per share  as computed as described in note of notes to financial statements  was for the decrease of per share vs 
was primarily attributable to the decrease in net loss from to  as well as an increase in the number of shares used to calculate per share loss from to operating trends 
it is expected that research funding from existing collaborations will increase from approximately  in to  in and then decrease to  in it is also expected that operating expenses will increase in order to further support existing collaborations and internal research efforts 
operating expenses are expected to continue to grow  at a minimum  consistent with historical trends 
patent related expenditures are expected to grow at a rate that is faster than the historical operating expense growth rate 
other income  net is expected to decline in and as existing funds are utilized to support the company s operations 
property and equipment costs are expected to continue to increase as the company s currently underutilized space is converted into laboratory space 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregated  and  respectively 
the decrease of  in was attributable primarily to the net loss for the year of approximately  the purchase of capital equipment of approximately  and patent costs of approximately  all of which were partially offset by the company s receipt of funds in the aggregate amount of approximately  from the sale of common stock pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of the company s initial public offering in january of their overallotment option  the exercise by an investment banking firm of certain warrants relating to a prior private placement  and the exercise of certain stock options under the company s incentive plan 
to date  the company has met its cash requirements through the sale of its stock  through licensing fees  research funding and milestone payments received under the collaborative agreements  through sbir grants and through interest earned on its investments 
as of december   the company had received approximately  from the sale of its stock  approximately  in licensing fees  research funding and milestone payments under the collaborative agreements  approximately  in sbir grants  and approximately  in other income  net 
to date  the portion of these funds that has been expended by the company has been used principally to fund research and development  purchase fixed assets used primarily in its research activities  to create its patent estate and to pay general and administrative support costs 
at december   the company was involved in collaborative arrangements with lilly  merck  novartis and dupont merck 
lilly  merck and novartis are expected to provide research funding to the company during and lilly and novartis are expected to provide funding to the company during the aggregate amount of research funding under these arrangements which the company expects to receive during and is approximately  and  respectively 
in february  the company entered into a collaborative arrangement with dupont merck 
the company does not anticipate any funding from this arrangement during or research funding under the lilly agreement is scheduled to expire on december  research funding under the merck agreement is scheduled to expire on november   but merck has the right to terminate the collaboration earlier by terminating the merck agreement upon days prior written notice 
except in the case of any such termination  merck is obligated to make payments to synaptic for its research support through november  under the novartis agreements  novartis is obligated to provide synaptic with research funding through august  at december   the company had invested an aggregate of  in property and equipment 
included within the  is  of equipment under capital leases 
the net present value of obligations under capital leases at december  was  this amount is secured by investment securities of the company which are  to the extent of the  recorded in the balance sheet as restricted securities 
the last of these lease agreements will expire on december  at december   the company had committed approximately  to provide for increased capacity in the company s assay systems  certain improvements in data base management and the construction and equipping of a laboratory related to the expansion in the lilly collaboration 
during  it is likely that the company will commit additional resources for the construction and equipping of additional laboratory space 
the company leases laboratory and office facilities under an agreement expiring on december  the minimum annual payment under the lease is  a standby letter of credit for  has been issued to the company s landlord as a security deposit and is secured by investment securities of the company which are  to the extent of  recorded in the balance sheet as restricted securities 
this standby letter of credit must be renewed annually during the life of the lease 
at december   the company had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the company intends to utilize these funds primarily to conduct its current and future research programs and to make leasehold improvements to its facilities beyond the level which existed on december  it is anticipated that the company will continue to incur significant operating losses for a number of years and will require the use of cash to finance its capital programs 
the company believes that its cash on hand  together with the funds that it expects to receive from its collaborative partners  interest income and funds received under sbir grants  will be sufficient to fund an increased operating expense level and an increased level of capital spending through june  disclosure regarding forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those relating to future cash and spending plans  amounts of future research funding  patent related plans  additional drug discovery programs  the effectiveness  efficacy  or other results of any of the company s technology or drugs  any other statements regarding future growth  future cash needs  future operations  business plans and financial results  and any other statements which are not historical facts

such cautionary statements qualify the forward looking statements included in this report 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements 
absence of developed products  early stage of product development 
the company was founded in january  has not completed development of any drugs and does not expect that any drugs resulting from its and its collaborative partners research and development efforts will be commercially available for a significant number of years  if at all 
since inception  the company has focused its activities on the discovery and cloning of receptor genes and the use of such genes as tools in the design of precisely targeted compounds for a broad range of therapeutic applications 
all compounds discovered by the company and its collaborative partners will require extensive preclinical and clinical testing prior to submission of any regulatory application for commercial use 
extensive preclinical and clinical testing required to establish safety and efficacy will take several years  and the time required to commercialize new drugs cannot be predicted with accuracy 
there can be no assurance that the company s approach to drug discovery  or the efforts of lilly  merck  novartis or dupont merck or any future collaborative partner or licensee of the company  will result in the development of any drugs  or that drugs  if successfully developed  will be proven to be safe and effective in clinical trials  meet applicable regulatory standards  be capable of being manufactured in commercial quantities at reasonable costs or be successfully commercialized 
product development of new pharmaceuticals is highly uncertain  and unanticipated developments  clinical or regulatory delays  unexpected adverse effects or inadequate therapeutic efficacy would slow or prevent product development efforts of the company or its collaborative partners and have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
dependence on collaborative partners for development  regulatory approvals  manufacturing  marketing and other resources 
the company s business strategy is to leverage its resources by entering into collaborative and licensing agreements with pharmaceutical companies 
under the collaborative agreements  the company s collaborative partners are generally responsible for preclinical testing and clinical trials of compounds developed through the use of the company s technology  regulatory approvals thereof and the manufacturing and commercialization of resulting drugs 
as a result  the company s receipt of revenues whether in the form of continued research funding  drug development milestones or royalties on sales under the collaborative agreements is dependent upon the activities and the development  manufacturing and marketing resources of its collaborative partners 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by the company s collaborative partners to their respective collaborations with the company is not within the company s control 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the interests of the company will continue to coincide with those of its collaborative partners  that some of the company s collaborative partners will not develop independently or with third parties drugs that could compete with drugs of the types covered by the collaborations  or that disagreements over rights or technology or other proprietary interests will not occur 
the company is dependent on its collaborative partners to fund a substantial portion of its activities over the next couple of years 
merck can terminate the merck agreement at any time upon days prior written notice 
if any of the company s collaborative partners terminates or breaches its agreement with the company  or fails to devote adequate resources to or to conduct in a timely manner its collaborative activities  the research program under the applicable collaborative agreement or the development and commercialization of drug candidates subject to such collaboration would be materially adversely affected 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s collaborations with lilly  merck  novartis and dupont merck will be successful 
nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to enter into acceptable collaborative or licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies in the future  or that  if negotiated  such arrangements would be successful 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding 
the operation of the company s business will require substantial capital resources 
no assurance can be given that its existing capital resources  together with future interest income and payments due under the collaborative agreements  will be sufficient 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company will receive the expected level of funding under the collaborative agreements 
the company expects that it will  in the future  seek to raise additional funding from other sources  including other collaborative partners and licensees  and through public or private financings  including sales of equity or debt securities 
any such collaborative or licensing arrangement could result in limitations on the company s ability to control the research and development of potential drugs and the commercialization of resulting drugs  if any  as well as its profits therefrom 
any such equity financing could result in dilution to the company s then existing stockholders 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available on favorable terms or at all  or that such funds  if raised  would be sufficient to permit the company to continue to conduct its operations 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to curtail significantly or eliminate one or more of its receptor or drug discovery programs 
history of operating losses and accumulated deficit 
the company has incurred net losses every year since its inception in january at december   the company s accumulated deficit was  losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with the company s research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with the company s operations 
the company expects to continue to incur substantial operating losses 
the only revenues generated by the company to date have resulted from payments under the collaborative agreements  interest income and funds from government grants 
the company s revenues  expenses and losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year 
research payments under the lilly agreement  the merck agreement and the novartis agreements are scheduled to expire in december  november and august  respectively  unless the research programs under such agreements are extended by mutual agreement of the company and lilly  merck or novartis 
the company does not receive research payments under the dupont merck agreement 
the company does not expect to achieve revenues or royalties from sales of drugs for a significant number of years  if at all 
the company will not achieve revenues or royalties from drug sales unless it or one of its collaborative partners successfully completes clinical trials with respect to a drug candidate  obtains regulatory approvals for that drug candidate and commercializes the resulting drug 
failure to achieve significant revenue or profitable operations could impair the company s ability to sustain operations and there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve significant revenues or profitable operations 
company s dependence on proprietary technology and unpredictability of patent protection 
the company s success depends  in part  on its ability to establish  protect and enforce its proprietary rights relating to its technology 
the company files patent applications in the united states and in other countries in order to protect its gene discoveries  compound discoveries and other inventions 
however  the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies is highly uncertain and involves many complex legal and technical issues 
there can be no assurance that patents will be granted with respect to any of the company s patent applications currently pending in the united states or in other countries  or with respect to applications filed by the company in the future 
also  there can be no assurance that the company s patent applications will not be challenged by way of interference proceedings or opposed by third parties or that the company will not be required to participate in interference proceedings or oppose the patents or patent applications of third parties in order to protect its rights 
interference proceedings and oppositions can be expensive to prosecute and defend 
one of the company s patent applications on file outside the united states is the subject of an opposition filed by a pharmaceutical company 
in addition  the company is seeking to provoke an interference by the united states patent and trademark office between one of its patent applications and an issued patent of a third party 
there can be no assurance that the outcome of the pending opposition proceeding and the anticipated interference proceeding will be favorable to the company 
in the event that the outcome of the opposition proceeding were unfavorable to the company  the company would not be issued the patent in the country in which the proceeding is taking place and would not be able to prevent third parties from practicing the subject matter of the opposed application in that country 
moreover  the opponent may seek to file similar oppositions in other countries 
in the event that the outcome of the interference proceeding were unfavorable to the company  the company might not be able to practice the subject matter of the relevant patent application in the united states 
even if the eventual outcome of the pending opposition proceeding and the anticipated interference proceeding were favorable to the company  the company s participation in them could result in substantial cost to the company 
there is no clear policy involving the breadth of claims allowed in patents or the degree of protection afforded thereunder 
there can be no assurance that claims in the company s patents  either as initially allowed by the united states patent and trademark office or any of its non united states counterparts or as subsequently interpreted by courts inside or outside the united states  will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s proprietary rights 
further  no assurance can be given that patents issued to the company will not be infringed  challenged  invalidated or circumvented by others  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company 
the field of gene discovery has become intensely competitive 
a number of pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  universities and research institutions have significantly expanded their gene discovery efforts in recent years and have filed patent applications or received patents covering their gene discoveries 
some of these applications or patents may be competitive with the company s applications or conflict in certain respects with claims made under the company s applications 
moreover  because patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  because patent applications in certain other countries generally are not published until more than eighteen months after they are filed and because publication of technological developments in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind the date of such developments  the company cannot be certain that it was the first to invent the subject matter covered by its patents or patent applications or that it was the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
if an issue regarding priority of inventions were to arise with respect to any of the company s patents or patent applications  the company might have to participate in litigation or interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office or similar agencies in other countries to determine priority of invention 
litigation to establish the validity of patents  to defend against patent infringement claims and to assert infringement claims against others can be expensive and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to the company 
if the outcome of patent prosecution or litigation is not favorable to the company  the company could be adversely affected 
in addition to patent protection  the company relies on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technological advances which it seeks to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with its collaborative partners  employees and consultants 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company would have adequate remedies for any such breach  or that the company s trade secrets  proprietary know how and technological advances will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others 
the commercial success of the company also depends on the company s ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
the company is aware of a large number of patents and patent applications of third parties that contain claims to genes that code for g protein coupled receptors and or compounds that interact with g protein coupled receptors 
patents issued to others may preclude the company from using or licensing its technology or may preclude the company or its collaborative partners from commercializing drugs developed with the use of the company s technology 
the company has acquired licenses to use certain technologies covered by patents owned by stanford university and the university of california  jointly  and columbia university and may be required to obtain additional licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of other parties in order to pursue its own technologies 
no assurance can be given that any such additional licenses would be made available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
the failure to obtain such licenses could result in delays in the company s or its collaborative partners activities  including the development  manufacture or sale of drugs requiring such licenses  or preclude such development  manufacture or sale 
risk of technological obsolescence and highly competitive industry 
the company operates in a field in which new developments occur and are expected to continue to occur at a rapid pace 
competition from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  joint ventures  academic and other research institutions and others is intense and is expected to increase 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and personnel resources than the company 
although the company believes that many elements of human receptor targeted drug design technology and the manner in which the company has integrated these elements are proprietary to the company  one or more of such elements are currently employed by several other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in their drug discovery efforts 
moreover  although the company believes that it has identified new and distinct approaches to drug discovery  there are other companies with drug discovery programs at least some of the objectives of which are the same as or similar to those of the company 
the company is aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are engaged in efforts to develop compounds that interact with g protein coupled receptors subtypes  including receptor subtypes with which the company is working 
there can be no assurance that competitors of the company will not develop competing technologies or drugs that are more effective than those developed by the company and its collaborative partners or obtain regulatory approvals of their drugs more rapidly than the company and its collaborative partners  thereby rendering the company s and its collaborative partners technologies and drugs obsolete or noncompetitive 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would limit the company s or its collaborative partners ability to use the company s technology or commercialize its or their drugs 
stringent government regulation and need for product approvals 
the preclinical testing and clinical trials of compounds developed through the use of the company s technology and the manufacturing and marketing of any drugs resulting therefrom are subject to regulation by numerous federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  the principal one of which is the fda  and by similar regulatory agencies in other countries in which drugs developed through the use of the company s technology may be tested and marketed 
any compound developed by the company or its collaborative partners must receive regulatory agency approval before it may be marketed as a drug in a particular country 
the regulatory process  which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each compound in order to establish its safety and efficacy  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory agency approval 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of drug development and or the period of review of any application for regulatory agency approval for a compound 
delays in obtaining regulatory agency approvals could adversely affect the marketing of any drugs developed by the company or its collaborative partners  impose costly procedures upon the company s and its collaborative partners activities  diminish any competitive advantages that the company or its collaborative partners may attain and adversely affect the company s ability to receive royalties 
there can be no assurance that  even after such time and expenditures  regulatory agency approvals will be obtained for any compounds developed by or in collaboration with the company 
moreover  even if regulatory agency approval for a compound is granted  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
further  approved drugs and their manufacturers are subject to continual review  and discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug or its manufacturer may result in restrictions on such drug or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the drug from the market 
regulatory agency approval of prices is required in many countries and may be required for the marketing of any drug developed by the company or its collaborative partners 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is highly dependent on its management and scientific staff 
loss of the services of any key individual could have an adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that its future success will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain highly talented managerial and scientific personnel and consultants 
the company faces intense competition for such personnel from  among others  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as academic and other research institutions 
there can be no assurance that it will be able to attract and retain the personnel it requires on acceptable terms
