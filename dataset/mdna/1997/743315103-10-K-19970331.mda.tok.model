investments the company invests in fixed maturity  equity and short term securities 
the company s investment strategy recognizes its need to maintain capital adequate to support its insurance operations and commitment to risk adverse investment policies 
therefore  the company evaluates the risk reward trade offs of investment opportunities  measuring their effects on stability  diversity  overall quality and liquidity of the investment portfolio 
the majority of the portfolio is invested in high grade  fixed maturity securities  of which short and intermediate term securities represented  million  or  in  and  million  or  in long term investment grade securities were million  or  in  and million  or  in non investment grade fixed maturity securities were million  or  in  and million  or  in and offer the company high returns and added diversification without a significant adverse effect on the stability and quality of the investment portfolio as a whole

million  respectively  at december  both the cmo and cmb portfolios are highly liquid with readily available quotes and contain no residual interests 
the remainder of the asset backed portfolio is invested primarily in auto loan and other asset backed securities 
investments in the company s portfolio have varying degrees of risk 
the primary market risk exposure to the fixed income portfolio is interest rate risk  which is limited by company restrictions as to the acceptable range of duration 
equity securities generally have greater risks than the non equity portion of the portfolio since these securities are subordinate to rights of debt holders and other creditors of the issuer and are subject to the volatility of the equity markets 
in addition  the foreign equity portfolio is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk  which is reduced by an active hedging policy 
the company regularly evaluates individual holdings for evidence of impairment 
changes in market value are evaluated to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to i interest rates  ii market related factors other than interest rates and iii financial conditions  business prospects and other fundamental factors specific to the issuer 
declines attributable to issuer fundamentals are reviewed in further detail 
available evidence is considered to estimate the realizable value of the investment 
when a security in the company s investment portfolio has a decline in market value which is other than temporary  the company is required by gaap to reduce the carrying value of such security to its net realizable value 
financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are used to manage the risks and enhance the yields of the available for sale portfolio 
this is accomplished by modifying the basis  duration  interest rate or foreign currency characteristics of the portfolio or hedged securities 
net cash requirements are limited to changes in market values which may vary based upon changes in interest rates and other factors 
exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying value  collateral is not required to support the credit risk 
during  the company added a government bond trading portfolio to benefit from short term market rate opportunities 
the company has stringent restrictions on the amount of open positions in the trading portfolio limiting its exposure to acceptable levels 
at december  and  there were no trading securities or off balance sheet trading positions 
results of operations operating income  which excludes net realized gains and losses from security sales and one time items  was million  or per share  in  million  or per share  in and million  or per share  in the gaap combined ratio was in  in and including the elimination of the supplemental reserve discussed below in direct premiums written increased to  million in  compared to  million in and  million in net premiums written increased to  million  compared to  million in and  million in the difference between direct and net premiums written is largely attributable to premiums written under state mandated involuntary commercial auto insurance procedures caip  for which the company retains no indemnity risk  of million in  million in and million in the company provided policy and claim processing services to state caips in  compared to in and premiums earned  which are a function of the amount of premiums written in the current and prior periods  increased in  compared to in and in the company s core business units net premiums written grew  and in  and  respectively  primarily driven by an increase in unit sales 
in  the company raised rates an average of  compared in and no rate changes in the company continues to write standard and preferred auto risks which represented between and of total core business volume 
to encourage writing more standard and preferred risks and to improve customer retention  the company adjusted the contingent cash incentive compensation program for to credit its conservative estimates of the increase in value created by adding new customers 
the company believes that growing the numbers of policyholders  particularly standard and preferred risks with their higher retention rates  builds intrinsic value because renewals are more profitable than first year business 
the drive to add customers faster will result in more spending to promote our brand and to develop more claim adjusters and customer service representatives 
these costs  along with expected losses on first year business  are likely to bring profit margins more in line with the company s objective of achieving a underwriting profit margin over the entire retention period of an insured 
in  the core business units generated an underwriting profit margin of  compared to in and in claim costs  the company s most significant expense  represent actual payments made and changes in estimated future payments to be made to or on behalf of its policyholders  including expenses required to settle claims and losses 
these costs include a loss estimate for future assignments and assessments  based on current business  under state mandated involuntary automobile programs 
claims costs are influenced by inflation and loss severity and frequency  the impact of which is mitigated by adequate pricing 
increases in the rate of inflation increase loss payments  which are made after premiums are collected 
accordingly  anticipated rates of inflation are taken into account when the company establishes premium rates and loss reserves 
claim costs  expressed as a percentage of premiums earned  were in  compared to in and excluding the elimination of the supplemental reserve in during  based on a review of the adequacy of its total loss reserves  the company eliminated its million supplemental reserve  resulting in a one time increase in earnings of 
per share  a point increase in the underwriting profit margin and a million increase in capital 
the company historically established case and ibnr reserves by product with the objective of being accurate to within plus or minus 
pricing has been based on these estimates of reserves by product 
because the company desired a very high degree of comfort that aggregate reserves were adequate  aggregate reserves were established near the upper end of the reasonable range of reserves  and the difference between such aggregate reserves and the midpoint of the reasonable range of case and ibnr reserves was called the supplemental reserve 
the company concluded  after examining its historical aggregate reserves  that the practice of setting aggregate reserves at the upper end of the range of reasonable reserves provided an unnecessarily high level of comfort 
at december   even without the high level of comfort provided by the supplemental reserve  the company s reserves would have been redundant by approximately to over the previous years 
the company believes that this change in the estimate of its reserves placed it more in line with the practices of other companies in the industry 
because the company is primarily an insurer of motor vehicles  it has limited exposure for environmental  product and general liability claims 
the company has established reserves for these exposures  in amounts which it believes to be adequate based on information currently known by it 
the company does not believe that these claims will have a material impact on the company s liquidity  results of operation  cash flows or financial condition 
during  the company settled the dispute  arising out of its acquisition of american star insurance company since renamed national continental insurance company over the seller s refusal to pay certain losses on pre sale business written by american star 
under the settlement  national continental received million from the seller and agreed to be solely responsible for the next million of gross losses 
the seller will thereafter be responsible for half the losses  net of reinsurance  if it achieves certain minimum net worth requirements 
in addition to the million  national continental will be entitled to the proceeds of various treaty and facultative reinsurance policies that had been purchased by american star 
national continental has established reserves for these exposures  which are mainly for product liability and environmental claims  in amounts it believes to be adequate based on information currently available to it  including a study by independent actuaries for the seller 
total reserves on this business are million  of which million is recoverable from reinsurers 
the company will continue to monitor these exposures  adjust the related reserves appropriately as additional information becomes known and disclose any material developments
