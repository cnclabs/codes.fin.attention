quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial performance is impacted by  among other factors  interest rate risk and credit risk 
the company utilizes no derivatives to mitigate its credit risk  relying instead on strict underwriting standards  loan review  and an adequate loan loss reserve 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
interest rate risk is the risk of loss in value due to changes in interest rates 
this risk is addressed by the company s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives 
the alco monitors and considers methods of managing interest rate risk by monitoring changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
the alco attempts to manage the various components of the company s balance sheet to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on npv and net interest income 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by the board of directors and the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the company s change in npv in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
if potential changes to npv and net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest rate swings are not within the limits established by the board  the board may direct management to adjust its asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within board approved limits 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company has developed strategies to manage its liquidity  shorten the effective maturities of certain interest earning assets  and increase the effective maturities of certain interest bearing liabilities 
first  the company has put greater emphasis on arms for residential lending  which generally reprice in one year 
this strategy includes purchasing high quality adjustable rate loans real estate loans for the portfolio 
second  the company has focused its non residential lending on adjustable or floating rate and or short term loans 
third  the company has focused its investment activities on short and medium term securities 
fourth  the company has attempted to maintain and increase its regular savings and transaction deposit accounts  which are considered to be relatively resistant to changes in interest rates 
the branch acquisition and new deposit product offerings provided significant progress on this aspect of interest rate risk management 
fifth  the company has utilized long term borrowings and deposit marketing programs to adjust the term to repricing of its liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity analysis is used to measure the company s interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in npv of its cash flows from assets and liabilities in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market rate sensitive instruments in the event of sudden and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates ranging from one hundred to four hundred basis points 
the company s board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes maximum decreases in the npv ranging from to in the event of sudden and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates 
the following tables present the association s projected change in npv and net interest income for the various rate shock levels as of september  and the board s established limitations relating thereto 
npv values and impact on net interest income for the association only are regularly calculated by the ots and internally per regulatory recommendations 
the assets and liabilities at the parent company level are not considered in the analysis 
the exclusion of holding company assets and liabilities does not have a significant effect on the analysis of npv sensitivity 
all market rate sensitive instruments presented in these tables are classified as either held to maturity or available for sale 
the association has no trading securities

at september   the association s estimated changes in npv were within the targets established by the board of directors 
npv is calculated based on the net present value of estimated cash flows utilizing market prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker quotations and other public sources 
computation of forecasted effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of npv 
actual values may differ from those projections presented  should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of npv 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the assets 
in addition  the proportion of adjustable rate loans in the association s portfolio could decrease in future periods if market interest rates remain at or decrease below current levels due to refinance activity 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the npv 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate mortgage loans may decrease in the event of interest rate increases
