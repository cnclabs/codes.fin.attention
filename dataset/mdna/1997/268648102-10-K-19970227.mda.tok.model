revenues total revenues for were  compared to  for  an increase of  or 
the increase in revenues was due primarily to the continued strong demand for the company s series of icda based products  particularly the open systems products which include the symmetrix series of products 
total revenues for compare to  for  an increase of  or 
software revenues are included in the product revenues for the respective mainframe and open systems markets 
revenues from products sold directly and through oems into the mainframe storage market were  in   in and  in  a decrease of  or from to  and an increase of  or from to the decrease in mainframe revenues in reflects price erosion for storage related products in this market partially offset by increased unit sales 
the company expects further declines in the mainframe revenue levels and revenue as a percentage of total revenues in revenues from products sold into the open systems storage market  which include the symmetrix products operating in an open systems environment and other products  were  in   in and  in revenues in this market in increased to approximately times revenues 
the open systems market represented of the company s total revenue in  compared to in the company expects further growth in open systems revenue levels and revenue as a percentage of total revenues in this market throughout revenues from products sold by mcdata  which include the escon director series of products  were  in and  in  an increase of  or 
revenues from all other products  which include the midrange series of products  were  in   in and  in  a decrease of  or from to  and a decrease of  or from to these decreases are primarily attributable to the declines in midrange series revenues 
revenues from service and rental income were  in   in and  in  an increase of  or from to  and an increase of  or from to in october  the company entered into a reseller agreement with hp under which hp markets and resells the symmetrix series of systems worldwide for connection to hp s series computers 
this agreement was expanded to enable hp to also market and resell this family of systems for connection to hp s series of computers 
the current agreement extends to june  revenues for under this agreement were  or of total revenues 
revenues for were not significant 
revenues on sales into the markets of north and south america were  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily due to growth in sales of the company s products in the open systems storage market 
total revenues for compare to  in  an increase of  or 
the us market amounted to greater than of the company s revenues in the north and south america segment 
international revenues were  or of total revenues in compared to  or of total revenues in the company expects further increases in international sales as a percentage of total revenues throughout revenues on sales into the markets of europe  africa and the middle east were  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily due to growth in sales of the symmetrix series of products in the open systems storage market 
during the company opened a sales office in israel 
during  the company opened sales offices in south africa  sweden  denmark  norway and finland 
total revenues for compare to  in  an increase of  or 
revenues on sales into the markets in the asia pacific region were  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase is primarily due to growth in sales of the symmetrix series of products in the mainframe storage market 
during  the company opened sales offices in korea and singapore 
total revenues for compare to  in  an increase of  or 
gross margins gross margins decreased to in  compared to in and in these decreases are primarily attributable to the impact of price declines in the mainframe and open systems storage markets being greater than the impact of cost declines in raw material components 
during the second half of  the rate of price declines moderated which  together with total revenue growth  increased software revenues and revenues from new symmetrix products  resulted in an increased gross margin percentage for that period as compared to the first half of software revenues were approximately  in software revenues were not significant in in  cost of goods sold included one time charges of approximately  net of tax  relating to end of life products and other inventory 
the company currently believes that price declines will continue 
research and development research and development r d expenses were   and  in  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in r d spending levels in over reflects the consolidation of domestic development efforts and the capitalization of software development costs primarily related to specific software products 
the decrease was partially offset by the cost of additional technical staff  especially to support development for products in the open systems storage market  and depreciation expenses associated with capital equipment acquired to facilitate development 
the company expects to continue to spend substantial amounts for r d in selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were   and  in  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the dollar increase in over is due primarily to costs associated with additional sales and support personnel and their related overhead costs  both domestically and internationally  in connection with the company s increased revenue levels and the company s initiative to capture market share for its open systems storage products 
the company has expanded the international direct sales force  particularly in the asia pacific region  as well as oem  alliance and partnership programs with applications  systems and database vendors 
expenses in include approximately  of costs related to the acquisition of mcdata 
sg a expenses are expected to increase in dollar terms during investment income and interest expense investment income increased to  in from  in and  in interest income was earned primarily from investments in cash equivalents and investments 
investment income increased in over primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances primarily generated from operations 
interest expense decreased to  in  from  in and  in the decrease in from is primarily due to conversions of the debentures in april interest expense in was primarily due to the notes  all of which were converted to common stock by january  provision for taxes the provision for income taxes was  in   in and  in  respectively  which resulted in effective tax rates of  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is mainly attributable to the realization of benefits associated with the continued progress on the company s various tax strategies and benefits related to offshore manufacturing 
financial condition cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments were  and  at december  and december   respectively  an increase of  in  cash and cash equivalents increased by  cash provided by operating activities was  this was primarily generated from net income and working capital management 
cash used by investing activities was  principally for additions to property  plant and equipment and the purchase of investments 
cash provided by financing activities was  principally due to proceeds from stock option exercises offset by repurchases of common stock 
in november  the board of directors rescinded the program under which common stock had been repurchased during in november  the company announced that it would redeem on january  all outstanding notes 
the aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding at the time of announcement was  the notes  issued by emc in december and january in an amount totaling million  were generally convertible into shares of common stock of the company at any time prior to the redemption date at a conversion price of per share 
at december   the holders of approximately million principal amount had elected to convert the notes to common stock 
on january   the company paid approximately  to redeem notes outstanding and the remainder converted into common stock 
the company has available for use its credit line of  and may elect to borrow at any time 
in february  the company announced its intention to issue and offer for sale up to approximately  convertible subordinated notes due in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the federal securities laws 
based on its current operating and capital expenditure forecasts  the company believes funds currently available  funds generated from operations and its available line of credit and the net proceeds to the company from the sale of the notes described above will be adequate to finance its operations as well as potential acquisitions 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s financial results 
the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities in this statement provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the statement also provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
the company believes that adoption will not have a material effect on its financial statements 
factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors  including but not limited to those set forth below  other one time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in emc s other filings at the us securities and exchange commission 
uneven pattern of quarterly results there has been a historic and recurring hockey stick pattern of the company s quarterly sales  by which a disproportionate percentage of a quarter s total sales occur in the last month and weeks and days of each quarter  making prediction of revenues  earnings and working capital for each financial period especially difficult and uncertain and increasing the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition 
this pattern of sales is itself believed to be the result of many factors including the significant size of emc s average product price in relation to its customers budgets  resulting in long lead times for customers budgetary approval  which tends to be given late in a quarter  the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase in the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from one or more competitors seeking their business  and  at times  seasonal influences  as well as the fourth quarter influence of customers spending their remaining capital budget authorization prior to new budget constraints in the next year s first quarter 
the hockey stick pattern of the company s sales also makes it extremely difficult to predict near term demand and adjust manufacturing capacity accordingly 
substantial variance of orders from the predicted demand may limit the company s ability to assemble  test and ship orders received in the last weeks and days of each quarter  which could adversely affect quarterly revenues and earnings 
in addition  revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and the company s backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels 
this is because the company manufactures its products on the basis of its forecast of near term demand and maintains inventory in advance of receipt of firm orders from customers  orders are generally shipped by the company shortly after receipt of the order  and customers may reschedule orders with little or no penalty 
these are additional factors making the prediction of revenues extremely difficult 
further  any unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expenses could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
competition there is strong competition in the computer data storage industry 
emc competes with many companies in the mainframe and open systems markets  certain of which have substantially greater financial and technological resources  larger distribution capabilities  earlier access to customers and greater overall customer loyalty than emc 
in the mainframe market  emc competes primarily with ibm 
in the open systems market  the company s primary competition is provided by systems vendors  including ibm  dec and sun 
in the company s opinion  the major competitive advantage of the open systems vendors is their overall market presence and ability to provide integrated cpu  storage and software packages 
emc s business may be adversely affected by the announcement or introduction of new products by its competitors  price reductions of its competitors equipment or services and the implementation of certain marketing strategies by its competitors 
as a significant number of emc s products are designed to be fully compatible with ibm computers and ibm operating systems  emc s business could also be adversely affected by modifications in the design or configuration of ibm computer systems 
pricing competitive pricing pressures exist in the computer storage market  and have had and may in the future have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and earnings 
there also has been and may continue to be a willingness on the part of certain large competitors to reduce prices in order to preserve or gain market share  which cannot be foreseen by the company 
the company believes that pricing pressures are likely to continue as competitors develop more competitive product offerings 
to date  the company has been able to manage its component and product design costs 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to achieve reductions in component and product design costs 
the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines could have an adverse effect on the company s earnings 
dependence on suppliers the company purchases certain components and products from suppliers who emc believes are currently the only suppliers of those components or products that meet emc s requirements 
among the most important components that emc uses are disk drives and high density memory components drams 
disk drives are a key component of the company s products and the company currently purchases substantially all of its disk drives from a single supplier 
emc purchases drams from a small number of qualified suppliers 
a failure by any supplier of disk drives  high density drams or other components to meet emc s delivery or quality requirements for an extended period of time could have a material adverse effect on emc 
the company is currently transitioning its product line from use of gb disk drives to new gb and gb disk drive technologies 
this transition may intensify the above risks 
from time to time  because of high industry demand and or the inability of certain vendors to consistently meet on a timely basis the company s component quality standards  the company has experienced delays in deliveries of disk drives and high density drams needed to satisfy orders for its icda products 
the company is currently working with such vendors to proactively maintain and or improve component quality standards and also continues to seek alternative sources of supply 
if such shortages and or performance problems were to intensify  the company could lose some time sensitive customer orders which could adversely affect quarterly revenues and earnings 
the adverse effect of a supplier s failure to meet emc s requirements may be intensified by the hockey stick pattern of the company s sales and the necessity of meeting critical manufacturing schedules 
new products technology and user needs change rapidly in the computer data storage industry  which requires ongoing technological development and introduction of new products 
sales of the symmetrix series of products constitute the principal source of revenues for emc and such sales are expected to continue to be the principal source of its revenues in the near future 
emc expects competition in the sale of icda products to increase  and there can be no assurance that the symmetrix series of products will continue to achieve market acceptance 
significant delays in the development of icda technology for future products or product enhancements would be to the advantage of emc s competitors 
furthermore  the continued development of icda technology and its incorporation into emc s future generations of products cannot be assured even with significant additional investments 
further risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of price performance relative to products of competitors  including competitors responses to the introductions  and the desire by customers to evaluate new  more expensive products for longer periods of time 
change in regulations the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if laws  regulations or standards relating to the company or its products were newly implemented or changed 
manufacturing risks emc s products operate near the limits of electronic and physical performance and are designed and manufactured with relatively small tolerances 
if flaws in design  production  assembly or testing occur on the part of emc or its suppliers  emc may experience a rate of failure in its products that results in substantial repair or replacement costs and potential damage to emc s reputation 
continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities and control of material and manufacturing quality and costs will be critical factors in the future growth of emc 
emc frequently revises and updates manufacturing and test processes to address engineering and component changes to its products and evaluates the reallocation of manufacturing resources among its facilities 
there can be no assurance that emc s efforts to monitor  develop and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for its products  especially the symmetrix series of products  will be sufficient to permit emc to avoid a rate of failure in its products that results in substantial delays in shipment  significant repair or replacement costs and potential damage to emc s reputation  any of which could have a substantial adverse effect on emc s operations and ultimately on its financial results 
indirect channels of distribution in  the company derived a significant percentage of its product revenues from reseller and oem channels 
a substantial portion of these reseller and oem revenues stems from the company s reseller agreement with hp  which currently expires in june of the company s financial results could be adversely affected if such contracts were terminated  if the company s relationship with such resellers or oems were to deteriorate or if the financial condition of its resellers and oems were to weaken 
in addition  the company is currently experiencing growth in the transition from the mainframe to the open systems market 
in this regard  the company may have an increased reliance on indirect channels of distribution 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining or expanding these indirect channels of distribution 
if the company is not successful  the company may lose certain sales opportunities 
furthermore  the partial reliance on indirect channels of distribution may materially reduce the visibility to management of potential orders 
alliances many of the company s products are marketed in conjunction with the products of other vendors  and the company plans to continue its strategy of developing key alliances 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its ongoing strategic partnerships or that the company will be able to find further suitable business relationships as it develops new products 
any failure to continue or expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
there can be no assurance that the company s distributors and strategic partners  many of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than the company  will not develop and market products in competition with the company in the future  discontinue their relationships with the company  or form competing arrangements with the company s competitors 
international sales a substantial portion of the company s revenues is derived from sales outside the united states 
in addition  a substantial portion of the company s products are manufactured outside of the united states 
accordingly  the company s future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade restrictions  import or export licensing requirements  the overlap of different tax structures or changes in international tax laws  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and longer payment cycles in certain countries 
management of growth the company has a history of rapid growth 
the company s future operating results will depend on management s ability to manage growth  continuously hire and retain significant numbers of qualified employees  forecast revenues and control expenses 
an unexpected decline in the growth rate of revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expense growth could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
dependence upon key personnel the company s continued growth and success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees 
competition for highly skilled personnel is intense in the high technology industry 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in continuously recruiting new personnel and in retaining existing personnel 
the loss of one or more key employees or the company s inability to attract additional qualified employees or retain other employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
enforcement of the company s intellectual property rights no assurance can be given that the company s patent applications will issue as patents or that any patents that may issue will provide the company with adequate protection for the covered products or technology 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company s confidentiality agreements will adequately protect its trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s activities will not infringe on the patents or proprietary rights of others or that the company will be able to obtain licenses to any technology that it may require to conduct its business or that  if obtainable  such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost 
although the company has significantly increased its patents and patent applications  the rapidly changing technology of the computer industry makes emc s future success dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of its personnel rather than on existing patent protection 
risks associated with future acquisitions as part of its business strategy  the company may make acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies 
any such future acquisitions or investments would be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in an acquisition of a business 
such risks include  among other things  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired business  the inability of management to maximize the financial and strategic position of the company through the successful incorporation of acquired personnel and customers  the maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company expects that the consideration paid for future acquisitions  if any  could be in the form of cash  stock  rights to purchase stock or a combination thereof 
dilution to existing stockholders and to earnings per share may result to the extent that shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock are issued in connection with any such future acquisitions 
volatility of stock price the company s stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility 
the announcement of new products  services or technological innovations by the company or its competitors  quarterly variations in the company s results of operations  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community and speculation in the press or investment community are among the factors affecting the company s stock price 
in addition  the stock price may be affected by general market conditions and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to the company s performance 
because of these reasons  recent trends should not be considered reliable indicators of future stock prices or financial results
