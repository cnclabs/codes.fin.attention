the company has not incurred any significant warranty expense to date 
the amount of sales returns of hardware and software has been immaterial in the fiscal years ended november   and product development and enhancement the computer software industry is characterized by continual technological change  requiring a high level of expenditures for the development and improvement of computer software products

there can be no assurance that such developments will occur or that such acquisitions will be made 
competition the company believes that its major competition is the in house data processing capability of life insurance companies 
in addition  other independent software producers compete in certain market segments served by the company 
the company believes that its products compete favorably with the competition  although it may be at a competitive disadvantage against companies with greater financial  technological  marketing  service and support resources 
the company believes that the most important considerations for potential purchasers of systems software packages are product capability  customer support and service  integration of the product line  continuity of product enhancement  ease of installation and use  documentation and training  the experience and financial stability of the vendor and to a lesser extent  price 
by virtue of its years of experience in developing software for use by the life insurance industry  the company believes that it has the ability to compete successfully with the data processing systems of life insurance companies and other independent software producers

despite these restrictions  it may be possible for competitors or users to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain information which the company regards as its trade secrets 
computer software generally cannot be patented  and existing copyright laws afford only limited protection 
the company believes that the rapid pace of technological change in the computer industry makes patent or copyright protection of less significance than such factors as the knowledge and experience of management and other personnel and the company s ability to develop  enhance  market and acquire new systems and services 
employees the company seeks to employ and retain highly skilled personnel who possess actuarial  marketing and computer programming skills
