the average monthly cellular service revenue per customer declined to in from in and in it has been an industry wide trend that early subscribers have normally been the heaviest users and that a higher percentage of new subscribers tend to be lower usage customers 
the average monthly service revenue per customer may further decline i as market penetration increases and additional lower usage customers are activated and ii as competitive pressures from current and future wireless communications providers intensify and place additional pressure on rates 
the company is responding to such competitive pressures by  among other things  modifying certain of its price plans and implementing certain other plans and promotions  all of which are likely to result in lower average revenue per customer

common stockholders equity as a percentage of total capitalization was and at december  and  respectively 
regulation and competition the telecommunications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory  competitive and technological changes that make it difficult to determine the form or degree of future regulation and competition affecting the company s telephone and mobile communications operations 
events affecting the telecommunications industry in recent years  the fcc and a number of state legislative and regulatory bodies have taken steps to foster local exchange competition 
coincident with this movement toward increased competition has been the relaxation of regulatory oversight of lecs 
these changes have led to the organization and continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with lecs services 
wireless telephone services are also expected to increasingly compete with lecs 
in february the united states congress accelerated these trends towards increased competition and reduced regulation by enacting the telecommunications act of the act 
the act obligates lecs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the lec s network and to take various other steps that are designed to lower barriers of entry to competitors 
under the act s rural telephone company exemption  each of the company s telephone subsidiaries is exempt from certain interconnection requirements until such time as the appropriate state regulatory commission receives certain notices and makes certain determinations 
in august the fcc issued an order which included rules implementing most of the interconnection provisions of the act 
under the fcc s order  rural lecs will have the burden of proving the continuing availability of the rural telephone company exemption 
the fcc order is currently subject to judicial review 
the act also provided that all interstate telecommunications carriers shall contribute to universal service support mechanisms  and authorized a federal state joint board the board to recommend changes to existing fcc support mechanisms to ensure that they will be consistent with the universal service principles in the act 
in november the board issued its recommendations 
although the board has recommended maintaining and funding universal service support mechanisms  the board deferred a recommendation on how large the subsidy should be 
the board also recommended creation of a billion fund for providing discounted services to schools and libraries 
the fcc is expected to take final actions on these recommendations prior to may  management believes that the act will ultimately increase competition in the company s telephone service areas  although the form and degree of competition cannot be ascertained with certainty until such time as final and nonappealable regulations implementing the act s interconnection and universal service provisions are in effect 
in december the fcc opened a new proceeding to address reforming the system requiring long distance carriers to pay certain lecs for access to the lecs networks 
although the fcc s proceeding primarily affects lecs other than those such as the company s lecs which are primarily subject to rate of return regulation  the fcc is expected to review a number of matters under this proceeding which will have an impact on rate of return companies  and the fcc plans to initiate a separate proceeding in to undertake a comprehensive review of rate of return incumbent lecs 
the fcc has outlined two possible approaches for restructuring access charges and for deregulating lec access services as competition develops in the lec market  one of which would allow the marketplace to determine access charges 
the other approach would involve the fcc mandating price levels or pricing methodologies 
in recent years  the fcc has allocated a significant amount of additional frequency spectrum for mobile communications technologies that are competitive with cellular  including pcs and mobile satellite services 
in several major pcs companies began providing services competitive with cellular in selected larger markets 
thus far pcs competition has been experienced in only one of the company s markets 
the company expects competition from pcs providers in certain of its other markets in the fcc has also authorized certain specialized mobile radio service licensees to configure their systems so as to operate in a manner similar to cellular systems 
competition to provide local exchange and access services is expected to initially affect large urban areas to a greater extent than rural  suburban and small urban areas such as those in which the company s telephone operations are located 
the same expectation applies to emerging competitive wireless technologies 
the company does not believe such competition is likely to materially affect it in the near term 
the company further believes that it may benefit from having the opportunity to observe the effects of these developments in large urban markets 
the company will continue to monitor ongoing changes in regulation  competition and technology and consider which developments provide the most favorable opportunities for the company to pursue 
recent events affecting the company revenues from the usf increased approximately million to million during after increasing million during the act contemplates certain changes to existing universal service support mechanisms  as described further in events affecting the telecommunications industry 
although the company anticipates that it may experience a reduction in its federal support revenues at some point in the future  management believes it is premature to assess or estimate the ultimate impact thereof 
there can be no assurance  however  that such impact will not be material 
in february the fcc sought public comments on whether it should initiate a rate of return represcription proceeding for lecs that are subject to rate of return regulation for interstate access revenues 
the company is unaware of any significant developments in this proceeding 
during the last few years  wisconsin  louisiana  ohio  michigan and certain other states in which the company operates took legislative and or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the lec business 
while the company is aware of only one company a cable company which has requested authorization to provide local exchange service in a portion of one of the company s service areas  it is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the future 
during the lpsc adopted a new regulatory plan for independent telephone companies in louisiana 
under this plan  the company s access revenues were reduced million in and  in  and the company anticipates that its access revenues will be further reduced by approximately million in and an additional million in the plan established a target rate of return of between and 
during and certain of the company s louisiana telephone subsidiaries  with the lpsc s approval  recorded an aggregate of million and million  respectively  of nonrecurring additional depreciation charges 
the company anticipates that certain of its louisiana telephone subsidiaries may continue to request nonrecurring additional depreciation charges in the future 
the company s louisiana telephone subsidiaries are required to file annual earnings monitoring reports with the lpsc 
based on the reports filed for  which gave effect to the access revenue reductions mentioned above and to other known and measurable changes  the company s louisiana telephone subsidiaries were not required to make adjustments to their rates 
there is no assurance  however  that revenues of such companies will not be further reduced in the future as a result of this plan 
certain long distance carriers continue to request that the company reduce intrastate access tariffed rates for certain of its telephone subsidiaries 
there is no assurance that these requests will not result in reduced intrastate access revenues in the future 
other matters the company s regulated telephone operations are subject to the provisions of sfas  under which the company is required to account for the economic effects of the rate making process  including the recognition of depreciation of plant and equipment over lives approved by regulators 
the ongoing applicability of sfas to the company s regulated telephone operations is being monitored due to the changing regulatory  competitive and legislative environments 
when the regulated operations of the company no longer qualify for the application of sfas  the net adjustments required will result in a material  extraordinary  noncash charge against earnings 
while the amount of such charge cannot be precisely estimated at this time  management believes that the noncash  after tax  extraordinary charge would be between million and million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company has certain obligations based on federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment 
costs of compliance through have not been material and the company currently has no reason to believe that such costs will become material
