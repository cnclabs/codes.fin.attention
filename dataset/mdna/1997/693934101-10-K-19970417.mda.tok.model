item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview from through  the company incurred substantial net losses before extraordinary gains 
in june  after the company was unsuccessful in voluntarily restructuring its existing indebtedness  the company filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in order to improve its capital structure and reduce its debt service requirements and overall indebtedness 
the company s plan of reorganization was confirmed in february and significantly improved the company s capital structure by reducing the company s debt and lowering lease and interest payments 
in march  the company paid the remaining balance owing to its unsecured creditors under the plan of reorganization with the exception of a few contested unsecured claims 
the company is still making payment on its priority tax claims in accordance with its plan of reorganization 
the company returned to profitability in the second half of as a result of the company s focused and simplified strategy  the implementation of which was accelerated after the company filed for reorganization 
the trucking industry  however  experienced significant overcapacity in as a result of carriers expanding fleets based on very strong customer demand in coupled with an economic slowdown in the second half of this overcapacity resulted in significant downward pressure on pricing in the industry during and  and adversely affected the company s operations which resulted in a lower average rate per mile and lower equipment utilization in and compared to  and an operating loss in the company finances the acquisition of some of its revenue equipment through operating leases 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the interest component of an operating lease is not treated as interest expense 
because of the company s use of operating leases  the company s operating ratio operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues is higher than it would be if it utilized only debt and or capital leases 
as a result  the company believes that its pre tax margin earnings before income taxes and extraordinary gains as a percentage of revenues is a more appropriate measure of its operating efficiency than its operating ratio 
at december   the company operated a revenue equipment fleet comprised of  tractors  including operated by independent contractors  and  trailers 
the company currently intends to maintain the number of independent contractors at approximately and maintain the company tractors at in the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of expense items to revenues for the years indicated

in addition  the company has significantly lowered the deductible amount on liability and property damage insurance coverage for while this caused premiums to increase  management feels that there will be a net reduction in insurance costs from this change 
during  the company s effective tax rate was because of its pre tax losses that exceeded any available carrybacks and an increase in the valuation for the net operating loss generated in as a consequence of the items discussed above  income loss before extraordinary gain in was  compared to  in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased by in to million compared to million in this revenue growth resulted primarily from an increase in revenue equipment as the average number of tractors increased to in compared to in revenues in were adversely affected by a decrease in the average revenue per total mile

insurance and claims increased to of revenues in compared to in as a result of an increase in insurance claims and losses in mainly involving new  less experienced drivers 
on october   management increased the training requirements for new drivers and has changed the driver pay to attract more experienced drivers which management believes are less accident prone

this reduction in maintenance expense was partially off set by costs associated with the company trading in tractors in compared to in communications and utilities increased to of revenues in compared to in  primarily as a result of the company utilizing on board communication systems in a larger portion of its fleet of tractors 
the company began installation of the system in june  in december   all of the tractors are equipped with the on board system

as a result of the company reducing its tractor fleet and making contractual debt payments  capitalized lease and long term obligations have decreased from million at december   to million at december the company has a credit facility with the bank of new york for issuance of letters of credit and advances to the company of up to million which expires december  advances under this credit facility may not exceed million

as outstanding letters of credit issued under this credit facility expire  the maximum commitment available under this credit facility will be reduced by the amount of the expiring letters of credit 
approximately  of letters of credit expire on june  this credit facility had loan covenants which obligated the company to maintain a required level of profitability and cash flow 
the company and the bank of new york recently entered into an amendment to this credit facility to delete certain financial covenants and add covenants requiring certain levels of tangible net worth for periods through and including december  the company may be required to seek additional amendments of the revolving credit facility with the bank of new york in the future based on actual operating results 
the amendment also shortened the expiration date of the credit facility from december  to december  management believes that following the expiration of the credit facility with the bank of new york  the company will be able to satisfy its anticipated insurance related letter of credit requirements  including the insurance related letter of credit requirements which are currently being met with letters of credit under the credit facility with the bank of new york  under its working capital line of credit with congress financial corporation northwest or new credit facilities 
there can be no assurance  however  that the congress financial corporation northwest credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy the company s insurance related letter of credit requirements or that the company will be able to obtain additional or new credit facilities on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
on august  the company obtained an additional million working capital line of credit with congress financial corporation northwest which expires august  this line of credit provides the company with additional working capital resources

additionally  the congress agreement restricts the payment of dividends 
on february   this line of credit was increased to million 
the company s net accounts receivable balance decreased by approxi mately million between december  and  as a result of reduced business levels in the company expects capital expenditures to be approximately million in primarily for replacement tractors and trailers  and the company s communications system 
in  the company acquired no new revenue equipment 
the company purchased million of revenue equipment formerly leased under operating leases in future expansion of the fleet will be made as future economic conditions dictate 
management believes that it will be able to obtain adequate financing for its planned capital expenditures in the company s business is capital intensive and will require the company to seek additional debt and possibly equity capital to enable the company to maintain a modern fleet and expand the size of its fleet as economic conditions improve 
whether such capital will be available on favorable terms  or at all  will depend on the company s future operating results  prevailing economic and industry conditions and other factors over which the company has little or no control 
fuel is one of the company s most substantial operating expenses 
in order to reduce the company s vulnerability to rapid increases in the price of fuel  the company enters into purchase contracts with fuel suppliers from time to time for a portion of its estimated fuel requirements at guaranteed prices 
as of december   the company had entered into various agreements with fuel suppliers to purchase approximately of its estimated fuel needs through june  at a guaranteed price 
although this arrangement helps reduce the company s vulnerability to rapid increases in the price of fuel  the company will not benefit from a decrease in the price of fuel to the extent of its commitment to purchase fuel under these contracts 
seasonality in the trucking industry  revenues generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season and its attendant weather variations 
operating expenses also tend to be higher during the cold weather months  primarily due to poorer fuel economy and increased maintenance costs 
inflation inflation can be expected to have an impact on the company s opera tions 
the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
factors affecting future results these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including decreased demand for freight  slower than anticipated economic conditions  shortages of drivers and such other risks as are identified and discussed herein and in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
these known and unknown risks and uncertainties could cause the company s actual results in future periods to be materially different from any future performance suggested herein
