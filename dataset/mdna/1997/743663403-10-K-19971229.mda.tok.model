item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except where the context indicates otherwise  the information contained in this item based on the company s business  operations and financial condition as of and for the year ended september  stockholders  potential investors and other readers of this report should be aware that the information below does not  in general  reflect the impact that the western resources transaction will have on the future business  operations  revenues  expenses and net income or loss  or the future liquidity and capital resources  of the company  western resources and that the business  results of operations and financial condition of the post transaction company may not follow the same historical trends or be subject to or reflect the same dependence on the economic and competitive factors described below 
overview a majority of the company s revenues are derived from recurring payments for the monitoring and servicing of security systems and additional security services  pursuant to contracts with initial terms ranging from one to five years 
service revenues are derived from payments under extended service contracts and for service calls performed on a time and materials basis 
the remainder of the company s revenues are derived from revenues from the sale and installation of security systems  add ons and upgrades 
payment for monitoring services is typically required in advance 
monitoring and service revenues are recognized as the service is provided 
installation  add on and upgrade revenue is recognized when the required work is completed 
all direct installation costs  which include materials  labor and installation overhead  and selling and marketing costs are expensed in the period incurred 
alarm monitoring services generate a significantly higher gross margin than do the other services provided by the company 
in fact  the cost of providing patrol and alarm response services exceeds the revenues generated by patrol services  and although sales and installation services contribute to the company s gross profits  the total expenses associated with alarm system installations including not only the direct costs of providing such services but also the expenses associated with the sales and marketing of alarm systems also exceed the revenues generated by such services 
the company s strategy  however  is to provide patrol and alarm response services and to invest in system sales and installation because the company believes that such services and products contribute to the generation and retention of alarm monitoring subscribers 
accounting differences for account purchases and new installations 
a difference between the accounting treatment of the purchase of subscriber accounts and the accounting treatment of the generation of subscriber accounts through direct sales by the company s sales force has a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
all direct external costs associated with purchases of subscriber accounts either through the dealer program or through acquisitions of subscriber account portfolios are capitalized and amortized over years on a straight line basis 
company personnel and related support and duplicate costs incurred solely in connection with subscriber account acquisitions and transitions are expensed as incurred 
other acquisition transition costs that reflect the company s estimate of costs associated with incorporating the purchased subscriber accounts into its operations  including costs incurred by the company in fulfilling the seller s pre acquisition warranty repair service and other obligations to the acquired subscribers are capitalized and amortized as described above 
in contrast  all of the company s costs related to the sales  marketing and installation of new alarm monitoring systems generated by the company s sales force are expensed in the period in which such activities occur 
change in accounting method 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company changed its method of accounting for certain subscriber account acquisition and transition costs  effective as of october  the acquisition and transition costs previously capitalized  which under the new method are expensed as incurred  are the company personnel and related support and duplicate costs incurred solely in connection with acquisitions and transitions 
the new method is consistent with emerging guidelines as published on july  by the emerging issue task force of the financial accounting standards board 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item hereof 
as a result of the change in accounting method i in the quarter ended december   the company recorded a non cash  non recurring charge of approximately million  which amount represents the cumulative effect net of income tax benefit of approximately million of the accounting change on prior years results of operations  and ii the company s statement of operations for fiscal includes and subsequent statements of operations will include a new expense item captioned acquisition and transition expenses to reflect the application of the new accounting method for fiscal and subsequent periods 
the expense was approximately million for fiscal before associated tax benefit 
the foregoing non recurring charge and expenses are reflected in the financial information presented in this report 
such expenses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based primarily on the amount of the company s acquisition activity and its ability to require sellers to bear certain of such acquisition related expenses 
acquisition and dealer program activity 
a significant portion of protection one s growth has been generated by the purchase of subscriber accounts through protection one s dealer program and through the acquisition of portfolios of subscriber accounts from other alarm companies 
protection one s dealer program consists of exclusive purchase agreements with independent alarm companies specializing in the sale and installation of new alarm systems 
dealer program participants install alarm systems which have a protection one logo on the keypad  arrange for subscribers to enter into protection one alarm monitoring agreements  and install protection one yard signs and window decals 
substantially all of these subscribers are contacted individually by protection one personnel  at the time of purchase of the accounts from the dealer  to facilitate customer satisfaction and quality control 
in addition  protection one requires dealers to evaluate the credit history of prospective new subscribers 
protection one also purchases portfolios of subscriber accounts 
because protection one typically acquires only the subscriber accounts and not the accounts receivable or similar assets of the sellers  protection one focuses its pre acquisition review and analysis on the quality and stability of the subscriber accounts to verify the monthly recurring revenue mrr represented by such accounts 
if the subscriber accounts to be purchased pass such due diligence scrutiny  protection one then applies its monitoring and other servicing costs to such mrr as a basis for determining the purchase price to be paid by protection one 
to protect protection one against the loss of acquired accounts  protection one typically seeks to obtain from the seller a guarantee against the subscriber account cancellation for a period following the acquisition and the right to retain a portion of the acquisition price a purchase price holdback against the mrr lost due to subscriber account cancellations during the specified period 
protection one obtains a similar purchase price holdback in its purchases through the dealer program 
during fiscal  the company added through acquisitions of portfolios of subscriber accounts and through its dealer program an aggregate of approximately  subscriber accounts for a total purchase price of approximately million including assumed liabilities of approximately million 
the mrr of the acquired accounts ranged from approximately to  with an average of 
of the acquisitions completed during fiscal by the company  the substantial majority included purchase price holdbacks in amounts that ranged from to of the initial purchase price and averaged of the initial purchase price and attrition guarantees for periods that ranged from six months to months and averaged months 
subscriber attrition 
subscriber attrition has a direct impact on the company s results of operations  since it affects both the company s revenues and its amortization expense 
attrition can be measured in terms of canceled subscriber accounts and in terms of decreased mrr resulting from canceled subscriber accounts 
gross subscriber attrition is defined by the company for a particular period as a quotient  the numerator of which is equal to the number of subscribers who disconnect service during such period and the denominator of which is the average of the number of subscribers at each month end during such period 
net mrr attrition is defined by the company for a particular period as a quotient  the numerator of which is an amount equal to gross mrr lost as the result of canceled subscriber accounts or services during such period  net of i mrr generated during such period by the sale of additional services and increases in rates to existing subscribers  ii mrr generated during such period from the connection of subscribers who move into premises previously occupied by subscribers and in which existing systems are installed and from conversion of accounts that were previously monitored by other companies to the company s monitoring service ie  reconnects and conversions  and iii attributable to canceled accounts that by virtue of a purchase holdback are put back to the seller of such accounts during such period ie  guaranteed accounts  and the denominator of which is the average month end mrr in effect during such period 
while the company reduces the gross mrr lost during a period by the amount of guaranteed accounts provided for in purchase agreements with sellers  in some cases the company may not collect all or any of the reimbursement due it from the seller 
the following table sets forth the company s gross subscriber attrition and net mrr attrition for the periods indicated twelve months ended september  gross subscriber attrition net mrr attrition management has established target ranges for gross subscriber attrition and net mrr attrition of and  respectively 
fluctuations in gross subscriber attrition reflect changes in levels of acquisition activity  at the rate at which subscribers move  the number of subscribers that the company disconnects for non payment and customer satisfaction with protection one s customer service and field repair functions 
changes in net mrr attrition are caused by the factors impacting gross subscriber attrition  as well as changes in protection one s ability to generate reconnects and conversions  to create mrr through the sale of additional services and price increases and to obtain purchase holdbacks covering the loss of acquired subscribers 
in each of fiscal years  and  gross subscriber attrition declined and net mrr attrition increased 
for each such period  while the gross number of subscriber disconnects as a percentage of the average subscriber balance decreased  such disconnects covered by purchase holdbacks declined and net mrr attrition increased 
mrr represents the monthly recurring revenue protection one is entitled to receive under subscriber contracts in effect at the end of the period 
included in mrr and the number of subscribers are amounts associated with subscribers with past due balances 
it is the policy and practice of protection one that every effort be made to preserve the revenue stream associated with these contractual obligations 
to this end  protection one actively works to both collect amounts owed and to retain the subscriber 
in certain instances  this collection and evaluation period may exceed six months in length 
when  in the judgment of protection one s collection personnel  all reasonable efforts have been made to collect balances due  subscribers are disconnected from protection one s monitoring center and are included in the calculation of gross subscriber and net mrr attrition 
because the company determines payments to sellers under purchase price holdbacks subsequent to the periods to which such holdbacks apply  and because holdbacks are not allocated to specific guaranteed accounts or specific fiscal periods  the company reduces gross mrr lost during a period by the amount of guaranteed accounts provided for in purchase agreements with sellers 
however  in some cases  the company has not retained the full amount of such holdback to which the company is contractually entitled 
if guaranteed accounts for which the company was not compensated by the seller were taken into account in calculating net mrr attrition  net mrr attrition would have been higher in each period presented in the table above 
generally  net mrr attrition is less than actual net account attrition  which the company defines as canceled subscriber accounts net of reconnects  conversions and guaranteed accounts 
estimated net account attrition is the basis upon which the company determines the period over which it amortizes its investment in subscriber accounts 
the company amortizes such investment over years based on current estimates 
if actual subscriber account attrition were to exceed such estimated attrition  the company could be required to amortize its investment in subscriber accounts over a shorter period  thus increasing amortization expense in the period in which such adjustment is made and in future periods 
since the majority of the subscriber accounts acquired by the company since its formation were purchased recently  there can be no assurance that the actual attrition rates for such accounts will not be greater than the rate assumed by the company 
see results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal amortization of subscriber accounts and goodwill below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
the table below sets forth the change in the company s subscriber base over fiscal years year ended september  beginning of period    additions through portfolio acquisitions and dealer program  net of sales of subscriber accounts    installations by company personnel  reconnects and conversions    gross subscriber attrition    end of period    changes in statement of operations presentation format 
beginning with its quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of fiscal  protection one made changes to its presentation of income statement information 
first  protection one has reclassified revenues and cost of revenues associated with its alarm response and patrol operations from the other category to monitoring and related services 
the other category now reflects solely results from protection one s installation  lock and other operations 
protection one made this change to better reflect its efforts to sell a bundle of monitoring  field service and alarm response services to both existing and new subscribers 
second  protection one has reclassified depreciation expense from monitoring and service cost of revenues  other cost of revenues and the selling  general and administrative expenses category  and included depreciation expense in a line item entitled amortization of intangibles and depreciation expense 
protection one made this change to allow readers to more easily calculate the aggregate amount of non cash charges in the income statement 
finally  protection one has reclassified customer service expense from monitoring and service cost of revenues to selling  general and administrative expenses 
this change reflects protection one s move to centralize all customer service functions into a single facility in chatsworth  california 
customer service personnel formerly dedicated to the support of monitoring and related services are responsible for protection one s entire customer service efforts 
results reported in this report for fiscal have been modified to reflect these changes and make the information for such periods comparable to information for the year ended september  amounts in the audited financial statements as of september  and and for the two years ended september  included in this report have also been reclassified to reflect these changes 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued several accounting pronouncements that the company will be required to adopt in future fiscal reporting periods 
fasb statement no 
earnings per share establishes new guidelines for the calculation of and disclosures regarding earnings per share 
the company will adopt the provisions of statement no 
for financial statements for periods after december   and at such time will be required to present basic and diluted earnings per share and to restate all prior periods 
there will be no impact on the calculation of basic earnings per share for the three months and nine months ended september  and diluted earnings per share is not expected to differ materially from basis earnings per share 
the company will adopt fasb statement no 
disclosure of information about capital structure for financial statements for periods after december  the company does not expect that adoption of the disclosure requirements of this pronouncement will have a material impact on its financial statements 
fasb statement no 
reporting comprehensive income  which the company will adopt for fiscal years beginning after december   establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in financial statements 
comprehensive income generally represents all changes in shareholders equity except those resulting from investments by or distributions to shareholders 
such changes are generally not significant to the company  and the adoption of statement no 
 including the required comparative presentation for prior periods  is not expected to have a material impact on its financial statements 
restrictions on dividends 
the company has never paid any cash dividends on the common stock with the exception of the special dividend associated with the western resources transaction and does not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
both the revolving credit facility and the discount note indenture restrict poi s ability to declare or pay any dividend on  or make any other distribution in respect of  poi s capital stock
