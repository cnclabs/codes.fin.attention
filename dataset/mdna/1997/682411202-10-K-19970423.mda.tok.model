this increase in net sales fiscal compared to adjusted fiscal is primarily due to improvements in the fourth quarter  particularly during the last six weeks of fiscal in fiscal  comparable store sales decreased year to date through the third quarter and increased during the fourth quarter  resulting in a comparable store sales decrease of for the year compared to adjusted fiscal comparable stores are those stores in operation at least months 
average store sales in fiscal showed some improvements over adjusted fiscal but were still less than historically high levels experienced prior to fiscal total average store sales in fiscal compared to adjusted fiscal were flat on a year to date basis through the third quarter and increased in the fourth quarter  resulting in an increase for the full year of 
sales trends thus far in fiscal remain encouraging with a comparable store sales increase of for the first two months of the fiscal year compared to last year 
management believes these trends are  in part  due to recent improvements in the women s apparel industry  a new merchandise replenishment system  improved merchandising mix with added focus on merchandise quality  value  sizing and presentation  as well as the favorable weather patterns experienced thus far in the company s trade area 
during the fourth quarter  the company tested and  beginning in fiscal  launched the implementation of its previously announced strategy to add new categories and styles of merchandise at alternative price points 
the company also tested and executed direct mail advertising campaigns during the second half of fiscal advertising expense in fiscal is not expected to increase materially compared to fiscal management believes the new merchandising concept will provide opportunities to improve sales and operating results in fiscal and strengthen the company s position in the marketplace 
the company aggressively closed underperforming stores in fiscal and the transition period and was very focused and selective in its new store site selections during the year 
the company opened stores and closed underperforming stores in fiscal compared to opening stores and closing underperforming stores in fiscal the company closed underperforming stores in the transition period

additionally  approximately stores are expected to close in fiscal  a number of stores more consistent with historical averages 
the company s sales and operating results are seasonal  as is typical in the women s retail apparel industry 
based on the former fiscal calendar january december  the company s sales historically were lowest during the first quarter january march and third quarter july september and highest during the second quarter april june and fourth quarter october december 
reduced sales volumes in the first and third quarters coincided with the transition of seasonal merchandise 
therefore  increased levels of markdowns occurred during those transitional periods  and operating expenses  when expressed as a percentage of sales  were typically higher 
as discussed above  the company changed its fiscal year end to conform the fiscal calendar to the seasonal patterns it experiences 
as a result  the company s historical quarterly patterns have changed 
fiscal and proforma fiscal produced higher sales and operating results in the first quarter february april and second quarter may july compared to the third quarter august october and fourth quarter november january 
management is unable to predict if this trend will continue in the future 
management does believe  however  that the pricing flexibility afforded by the new merchandising strategy should enable the company to increase its absolute and relative sales performance in the second half of the fiscal year since the company will be able to offer its customers a greater selection of fall and winter apparel categories 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal for fiscal and  distribution and merchandise acquisition costs were reclassified as a component of cost of goods sold from selling  general and administrative expenses to conform to the current year presentation 
this increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales primarily resulted from efficiencies in the company s distribution center and lower levels of markdowns taken due to management s efforts to control inventory levels and flow 
decreases as a percentage of net sales in distribution costs and markdowns were slightly offset by higher buying costs primarily due to additions to the merchandising staff at the company s home office 
distribution costs in dollars on an average store basis decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease in distribution costs was the result of efficiencies associated with the distribution center s first full year of operation since expansion of the facility and the implementation of a new warehouse management system 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal when expressed as a percentage of net sales  store operating costs decreased while home office and other expenses increased 
selling  general and administrative expenses in dollars on an average store basis increased 
this increase resulted primarily from rolling out a direct mail advertising campaign in the fourth quarter  a one time charge to record certain post retirement benefits and recording a greater loss on fixed assets as a result of closing more underperforming stores than in fiscal average salaries and wages in the company s stores increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase  affecting primarily part time associates  is largely due to the increase in the federal minimum wage which was effective in october in september  the second phase of the federal minimum wage increase will take effect 
management estimates the incremental impact of the increases in the federal minimum wage will increase store payroll expense in fiscal by approximately  store rent expense as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal average store rent expense in dollars increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the company s store expansion strategy of increasing the proportion of higher volume stores  and  thus entering more costly sites with higher rents  and the closing of older  underperforming stores which had lower average rent costs 
management anticipates that this trend of increasing average store rents may continue 
the company has approximately existing leases that expire or have initial lease terms containing lessee renewal options which may be exercised during fiscal management believes that the company will not experience a material increase in aggregate store rents as a result of renewal options or negotiating new lease terms for such locations 
depreciation and amortization expense was of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal this increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted primarily from the completion of the distribution center expansion late in the second half of fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to tax benefits generated in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal these tax benefits included the carryback of the federal targeted jobs tax credit and the recognition in fiscal of the deferred income tax asset associated with the remaining net operating loss carryforward generated by the company s puerto rico subsidiary in management estimates the company s effective income tax rate will be approximately in fiscal five week transition period ended february  compared to four week period ended january  unaudited see note i net sales for the five week period ended february  were  compared to  for the four week period ended january  on an average store basis  net sales decreased 
comparable store sales adjusted for the calendar shift to compare the five week period ended february  to the five week period ended february  decreased

gross margin was in january compared to a deficiency of in january january distribution and buying costs were reclassified as a component of cost of goods sold from selling  general and administrative expenses to conform to the current presentation 
the improvement in gross margin was principally due to the change in accounting for merchandise inventories discussed below and efficiencies in the company s distribution center
