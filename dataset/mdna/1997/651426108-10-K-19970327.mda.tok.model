inflation  risks and related factors newhall land s annual report and other published documents contain forward looking statements regarding the status of proposed or pending sales and rental activity  future planned development  future results of operations and financial condition  the long term growth of the southern california economy and other matters 
these forward looking statements are based on present trends the company is experiencing in residential  industrial and commercial markets 
also  the company s success in obtaining entitlements  governmental and environmental regulations  timing of escrow closings  expansion of its income portfolio and marketplace acceptance of its business strategies are factors that could affect results 
the following risks and related factors  among others  should be taken into consideration in evaluating the future prospects for the company 
actual results may materially differ from those projected 
sales of real estate the majority of the company s revenues are generated by its real estate operations 
the ability of the company to consummate sales of real estate is dependent upon various factors  including but not limited to availability of financing to the buyer  regulatory and legal issues and successful completion of the buyer s item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued due diligence 
the fact that a real estate transaction has entered escrow does not necessarily mean that the transaction will ultimately close 
therefore  the timing of sales may differ from that anticipated by the company 
the inability to close sales as anticipated could adversely impact the recognition of revenue in any specific period 
economic conditions real estate development is significantly impacted by general and local economic conditions which are beyond the control of the company 
the company s real estate operations are concentrated in southern california 
the regional economy is profoundly affected by the entertainment  technology and certain other segments  which have been known to affect the region s demographics 
consequently  all sectors of real estate development for the company tend to be cyclical 
while the economy of southern california has shown improvements recently  there can be no assurances that present trends will continue 
interest rates and financing fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of financing have an important impact on the company s performance 
sales of the company s projects could be adversely impacted by the inability of buyers to obtain adequate financing 
further  the company s real estate development activities are dependent on the availability of adequate sources of capital 
certain of the company s credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and would be negatively impacted by increasing interest rates 
competition the sale and leasing of residential  industrial and commercial real estate is highly competitive  with competition coming from numerous and varied sources 
the degree of competition is affected by such factors as the supply of real estate available which is comparable to that sold and leased by the company and the level of demand for such real estate 
while the company recently has continued to increase its market share at both the local and the county level  new competition is expected to deliver competing projects in the future that could reverse this trend 
geographic concentration with the sale of mcdowell mountain ranch  the company s real estate development activities currently are focused on its  acres in los angeles county  miles north of los angeles 
the company s entire commercial income portfolio is located in the valencia area 
therefore  any factors affecting that concentrated area  such as changes in the housing market or environmental factors which cannot be predicted with certainty  could affect future results 
government regulation and entitlement risks in developing its projects  the company must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities regulating such matters as permitted land uses  density and traffic  and the providing of utility services such as electricity  water and waste disposal 
in addition  the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment 
this government regulation affects the types of projects which can be pursued by the company and increases the cost of development and ownership 
the company devotes substantial financial and managerial resources to complying with these requirements and dealing with the process 
to varying degrees  certain permits and approvals will be required to complete the developments currently being undertaken  or planned by the company 
furthermore  the timing  cost and scope of planned projects may be subject to legal challenges  particularly large projects with regional impacts 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted is subject to factors such as changes in policies  rules and regulations and their interpretation and application 
the ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits for its projects can be beyond the company s control and could restrict or prevent development of otherwise desirable new properties 
the company s results of operations in any period will be affected by the amount of entitled properties the company has in inventory 
inflation the company believes it is well positioned against any effects of inflation 
historically  during periods of inflation  the company has been able to increase selling prices of properties to offset rising costs of land development and construction 
however  in the past few years  there has been a decline in land values in california and sales prices of some company properties have shown decreases while costs have remained relatively constant 
a portion of the commercial income portfolio is protected from inflation since percentage rent clauses in the company s leases tend to adjust rental receipts for inflation  while the underlying value of commercial properties has tended to rise over the long term
