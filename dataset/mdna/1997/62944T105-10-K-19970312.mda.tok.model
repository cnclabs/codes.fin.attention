 accounting for certain mortgage banking activities  by requiring that a mortgage banking enterprise that acquires mortgage servicing rights through either the purchase or origination of mortgage loans recognize those rights as separate assets by allocating the total cost of the mortgage loans to the mortgage servicing rights and the loans without the mortgage servicing rights based on their relative fair values 
retroactive application of sfas no 
to periods prior to the fiscal year of adoption is prohibited

requires that a mortgage banking enterprise assess its capitalized mortgage servicing rights for impairment based on the fair value of those rights 
such adoption caused financial services operating income to increase by and  respectively  during the years ended december  and mortgage banking fees in were lower in comparison to  which is primarily attributable to the loss on sale of servicing rights and lower servicing fee revenues resulting from the reduction in the mortgage loan servicing portfolio 
these lower revenues were partially offset by the improved marketing results on the sale of mortgage loans and higher servicing values realized through the sale of mortgage servicing rights recognized under sfas no

operating income was higher due to the aforementioned adoption of sfas and to second half declining interest rates that had improved overall market conditions and contributed to stronger loan closing activity and marketing results in the last quarter of in response to market conditions  the financial services segment closed thirteen mortgage origination branches during the third quarter of and accrued approximately  in office closure expenses 
seasonality the results of nvr s homebuilding operations generally reflect the seasonality of the housing market in the middle atlantic region of the united states 
nvr historically has entered into more sales contracts in this region during the first and second quarters  and the highest numbers of settlements historically have occurred in the second  third and fourth quarters 
because nvr s financial services operations generate part of their business from nvr s homebuilding operations and from outside homebuilders affected by seasonality  to the extent that homebuilding is adversely affected by seasonality  financial services operations may also be affected 
the existence of mortgage banking and title services offices outside of the middle atlantic region and the existence of third party business tend to reduce the effects of seasonality on the results of nvr s operations
