on july   the insurance commissioner of the state of new jersey took possession and control of mbli s assets 
in april  a rehabilitation plan was approved by the superior court of new jersey 
pursuant to the plan  the gics are supported by a group of life insurance companies and are to be paid out from the assets of mbl life assurance corporation  the successor to mbli 
the company is not presently able to determine whether the k plan or its participants will incur any losses or whether  if such losses are incurred  the company might be subject to any liability either directly as a plan fiduciary or as an indemnitor of officers and directors of the company who serve as trustees of the plan 
the company believes that existing cash balances together with funds generated from operations will be sufficient to finance the company s operations and meet its foreseeable cash requirements including planned capital expenditures  lease commitments  and other long term obligations through the next twelve months 
factors that may affect future results the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves certain risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results that may be caused by many factors  including changes in demand for the company s products  introduction  enhancement or announcement of products by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new products  size and timing of significant orders  budgeting cycles of customers  mix of distribution channels  mix of products and services sold  mix of international and north american revenues  changes in the level of operating expenses  changes in the company s sales incentive plans  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products announced by the company or its competitors and general economic conditions 
revenue forecasting is uncertain  in large part  because the company generally ships its products upon receipt of orders 
this uncertainty is compounded because each quarter s revenue is derived disproportionately from orders booked and shipped during the third month  and disproportionately in the latter half of that month 
in contrast  most of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  including costs of personnel and facilities  and are not easily reduced 
thus  an unexpected reduction in the company s revenue  or a decrease in the rate of growth of such revenue  would have a material adverse effect on the profitability of the company 
the company develops  markets and supports its core product line  the progress application development environment  the progress rdbms and the progress dataserver architecture collectively  progress 
in november  the company began shipping the latest major enhancement to the progress product line  progress version in october  the company began shipments of webspeed  an open development and deployment environment that enables organizations to build transaction processing applications on the internet and corporate intranets 
the company s crescent division develops and markets a collection of advanced tools and components to visual basic and visual j development teams 
the crescent division began offering these products commercially in january and has since released major enhancements to its existing line of products as well as many new products 
although the company believes that progress  webspeed and the crescent line of products have features and functionality which enable the company to compete effectively with other vendors of application development products  ongoing enhancements to progress  webspeed and the crescent line of products will be required to enable the company to maintain its competitive position 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing enhancements to its products on a timely basis  or that the enhancements will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
delays in the release of enhancements may negatively affect results 
the company has derived most of its revenue from progress and other products which complement progress and are generally licensed only in conjunction with progress 
accordingly  the company s future results depend on continued market acceptance of progress and any factor adversely affecting the market for progress could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its financial results 
future results may also depend upon the company s continued successful distribution of progress through its application partner channel and may be impacted by downward pressure on pricing  which may not be offset by increases in volume 
application partners resell progress along with their own applications and any adverse effect on their business related to competition  pricing and other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company experiences significant competition from a variety of sources with respect to the marketing and distribution of its products 
some of these competitors have greater financial  marketing or technical resources than the company and may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than can the company 
increased competition could make it more difficult for the company to maintain its market presence 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing their ability to deliver products which address the needs of the company s prospective customers 
current and potential competitors also may be more successful than the company in having their products or technologies widely accepted 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and their failure so to do could have a material adverse affect upon the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
the company hopes that the crescent division and other new products  such as webspeed  will contribute positively to the company s future results 
the market for the crescent product line is extremely competitive and may be affected by changes in microsoft s strategy with respect to visual basic and visual j and the add on product market for such products  and market acceptance of products competitive with visual basic and visual j 
the market for internet transaction processing products  such as webspeed  is highly competitive and will depend in large part on the commercial acceptance of the internet as a medium for all types of commerce 
because global commerce and online exchange of information on the internet and other similar open wide area networks are new and evolving  it is difficult to predict with any assurance that the infrastructure or complementary products necessary to make the internet a viable medium for all types of commerce will be developed 
overlaying the risks associated with the company s existing products and enhancements are ongoing technological developments and rapid changes in customer requirements 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that take advantage of technological advances and respond to new customer requirements 
the company is currently developing new products intended to help organizations meet the future needs of application developers 
the development of new products is increasingly complex and uncertain  which increases the risk of delays 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products incorporating new technology on a timely basis  or that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
the marketplace for these new products is intensely competitive and characterized by low barriers to entry 
as a result  new competitors possessing technological  marketing or other competitive advantages may emerge and rapidly acquire market share 
approximately of the company s total revenue in fiscal was attributable to international sales made through international subsidiaries 
because a substantial portion of the company s total revenue is derived from such international operations which are conducted in foreign currencies  changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar may affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
the company engages in certain currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that such hedging transactions will materially reduce the effect of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates on such results 
if for any reason exchange or price controls or other restrictions on the conversion of foreign currencies were imposed  the company s business could be adversely affected 
other potential risks inherent in the company s international business generally include longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  and potentially adverse tax consequences  any of which could adversely impact the success of the company s international operations 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international operations  if any  and  consequently  on the company s business  financial condition  and operating results 
the company s future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel in the software industry is intense 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel it requires to successfully develop new and enhanced products and to continue to grow and operate profitably 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary software technology 
the company relies principally on a combination of contract provisions and copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technology 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or independent development by others of similar technology 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  to protect the company s trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claim of infringement or invalidity 
although the company believes that its products and technology do not infringe on any existing proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
the company also utilizes certain technology which it licenses from third parties  including software which is integrated with internally developed software and used in the company s products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurance that functionally similar technology will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future 
the market price of the company s common stock  like that of other technology companies  is highly volatile and is subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  or other events or factors 
the company s stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to the company s performance
