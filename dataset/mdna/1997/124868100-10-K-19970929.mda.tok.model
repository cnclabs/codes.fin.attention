yield per passenger mile continued to improve in  resulting in cent per revenue passenger mile rpm as compared to cent per rpm in fiscal annual revenues increased in fiscal to  over fiscal revenues of  the increase over prior year is attributable primarily to increased average fares related to continued industrywide fare growth 
low fare competitors remain absent from the markets served by the company 
additionally  the company maintained local market fares introduced in february to stimulate travel  resulting in enhanced revenues throughout fiscal annual and quarterly yield comparisons are complicated by the expiration and reimplementation of the federal ticket tax in fiscal and the tax lapsed on december  and was reinstated in late august  the tax again expired on december  and was resumed in early march  the company believes that its passenger revenues were stimulated during the periods the tax was not in effect the absence of the tax effectively reduced the cost of air travel 
the company is not able to determine the extent to which operating results in fiscal and benefited from the absence of the tax  although it does believe that it had a positive impact on its operating results 
a new excise tax formula is being implemented by the federal government on october   the results of this are not expected to significantly impact the operating results of the company 
available seat miles asms decreased from fiscal the company discontinued service between shenandoah valley  virginia and baltimore  maryland in december  pursuant to an economic analysis of shorts aircraft utilization and profitability  the company reduced the number of flights using these aircraft in december  as such  only seven of the nine shorts aircraft were scheduled for the last seven months of fiscal while asms thus decreased for the last seven months of fiscal when compared to  the load factor increased from for the seven months in fiscal to for the comparable period in fiscal the company  while able to implement changes in its flight schedule after receiving the consent of us airways  has limited control over the cities it serves as a us airways express carrier 
the company did receive approval to discontinue service to shenandoah valley  virginia and montgomery  alabama effective july  and september   respectively  based upon profitability and aircraft utilization studies 
the company is not aware of any other schedule changes being contemplated that would have a significant impact on operations 
rpms increased commensurately with revenue passengers  reflecting growth of over fiscal elevated rpms  passengers carried and average fares are indicative of the overall health of the air transportation industry 
the company continued to maintain its upward trend in average fares for fiscal the fiscal average fare was  compared to in fiscal operating costs per asm escalated from cent to cent from fiscal to fiscal contributing factors include increases in maintenance outside repair expenses  fuel cost  flight operations and customer service wages and us airways fees for ticketing and passenger handling 
these increases were partially mitigated by cost reductions realized in the company s aircraft hull insurance  engine overhaul amortization expenses and savings realized under the first full year of reduced jetstream lease payments 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued results of operations  continued fiscal  continued flight operations expense stabilized in fiscal at  as compared to  in fiscal although the company experienced significant increases in pilot and flight management salaries  the additional expenses were offset by reductions in hull insurance rates and aircraft lease payments 
the company continues to benefit from reductions in the insured value of the aircraft fleet and more favorable hull insurance rates resulting in annual savings of  in additionally  renegotiated lease payments for the jetstream fleet finalized in resulted in further reductions to lease expenses as compared to fiscal pilot salaries escalated  or  over fiscal to  in fiscal under the plan negotiated with the air line pilots association alpa  pilot salaries were initially reduced by in october  with of the original concession being reinstated after each subsequent four month period 
the final increase scheduled under this plan occurred in february  accordingly  fiscal was the first complete year under the fully reinstated salary levels 
furthermore  annual seniority wage increases contributed to the augmentation of pilot salary expense 
flight operations management and support salary expenses also grew by  as compared to  enhancement of the training and crew scheduling departments are the primary factors 
crew travel expenses  comprised of meal allowances and accommodations declined significantly  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal in april   crews were placed in four newly established crew bases in lynchburg  virginia  cincinnati  ohio  lexington  kentucky and kinston  north carolina 
establishment and maintenance of these new crew bases resulted in savings of  in fiscal the company is obligated pursuant to its contract with its pilots to match pilot contributions to the company s k plan based upon an agreed upon earnings formula 
the company has recorded  of compensation expense related to its contractual obligation as flight operations expense in fiscal the company had insufficient earnings to trigger the matching provision in fiscal market fluctuations in price variances in and asms flown cause annual fuel and oil expenses to be volatile 
despite a decline in asms flown  the company experienced a increase in fuel and oil expense  with expenditures of  in fiscal versus  in fiscal fuel consumption was million gallons at an average price per gallon of cent in fiscal  as compared to million gallons at cent per gallon in fiscal fuel prices peaked from october  through february   averaging cent per gallon during this period 
average price per gallon had waned to approximately cent per gallon by june  as fuel expense is only of total operating expenses  the company does not believe it is cost effective to attempt to manage fuel price risk  thus no derivatives or other off balance sheet instruments are used for hedging purposes 
maintenance materials  repairs and overhead decreased from fiscal  as expense was  in fiscal versus  in fiscal maintenance expenses typically fluctuate based upon flight hours and takeoffs and landings 
maintenance expense per asm remained relatively constant  cent in and cent in ground operations expenses increased over prior year  resulting in fiscal expenditures of  versus  in fiscal us airways passenger handling fees continued to increase 
in markets where us airways personnel provide customer service and handling  a fee is charged to the company  this fee increased cent per passenger in february  fees have increased periodically as follows july  per passenger  january  per passenger  and february  per passenger 
while passengers carried increased by only  or  passenger handling fees escalated  or  in fiscal ground operations expense is offset in charlotte  north carolina through the company s reimbursement rate for operating concourse d at the charlotte douglas international airport 
the company s reimbursement increased from  to  in august  and  in january  the company cannot predict the timing or extent of any future passenger handling fee adjustments 
customer service salaries at company operated stations increased  due to the combination of general wage increases  service schedule alterations  and additional overtime 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued results of operations  continued fiscal  continued advertising  promotion and commissions expense increased from of passenger revenue in fiscal to in fiscal on january   us airways implemented a new reservations fee structure which resulted in an additional 
per passenger charge 
fiscal thus received an entire year  or an additional  of this expense as compared to crs fees also increased on a per passenger basis in fiscal total general and administrative expenses in fiscal were  as compared to  in fiscal  for a decrease of 
while salaries increased by  property taxes declined  the property tax decrease was due to refunds of  resulting from personal property reclassifications for tax purposes for the years allowed under local statute 
other general and administrative decreases resulted from  in refunded sales and use taxes related to off road fuel taxes originally remitted in through depreciation and amortization expense declined slightly from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  as asset additions for rotable flight equipment  ground equipment and leasehold improvements were minimal in the current year  and thus little depreciation was generated on current year property additions 
in fiscal  recognition of net operating loss carryforwards offset income tax expense at the statutory rate  however  the company s effective federal income tax rate was which reflects the impact of the alternative minimum tax on operations 
income tax expense was  in fiscal  as compared to  for fiscal at june  the company had approximately  of united states federal regular tax operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
these carryforwards begin expiring on june  the estimates of future results included above are based upon present information regarding operations and future trends 
while the company believes that the estimates constitute its best judgment on future results  the actual results may differ materially from the estimates 
fiscal the operating results for fiscal continued the positive trend from fiscal passenger revenues increased  attributable to the improved yield per revenue passenger mile of cent in fiscal from cent in fiscal the result of these overall improvements was operating income of  and a net income of  versus operating income of  and a net loss of  in fiscal operating expense increases of partially offset the revenue improvement 
annual revenues for the and fiscal years were  and  respectively 
the increase over the prior year was due to the absence of low fare competitors in the company s markets and to continued industrywide fare growth 
additionally  in february  the company implemented local market fares for travel between company controlled destinations  thus stimulating travel and increasing revenues 
revenues were significantly hampered  however  by inclement weather in the company s operating area during the third quarter of severe winter storms caused the cancellation of approximately  flights during this quarter 
as a result  the company estimates that operating revenues were adversely impacted by approximately  harsh weather in the northeast section of the united states caused further revenue losses as connecting passengers with reservations on the company s flights were unable to initiate their trips 
the company experienced yield erosion in the months of may and june  the yield declined from cent in april to cent in may and cent in june 
while some slippage in yield is normal  the presence of low cost low fare competitors in the company s service area exacerbated the negative effects 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued results of operations  continued fiscal  continued available seat miles increased over fiscal the growth was primarily due to increased daily service to longer haul markets  including columbus  georgia  lexington  kentucky and lynchburg  virginia  increasing total weekday departures to from in fiscal while the number of revenue passengers carried decreased by  revenue passenger miles increased as compared to fiscal as a result of changes to the company s service schedule 
because the low fare competition in was not present in to depress fares  the company was able to maintain higher average ticket prices of in fiscal versus in fiscal  thus increasing yield per revenue passenger mile to cent  an increase of over operating costs per available seat mile increased from cent to cent for fiscal to contributing factors include increases in fuel costs  pilot training expenses  us airways fees and engine overhaul expenses 
a portion of these increases were offset by cost reductions recognized in the company s aircraft hull insurance  professional fees and property tax expenses 
flight operations expense increased to  in  compared to  in fiscal in fiscal reductions in aircraft lease rates were achieved through negotiations with lessors  which the company continued receiving the benefit of in fiscal additionally  more favorable hull insurance rates and reductions in the insured value of the company s aircraft yielded a decrease in hull insurance expense of or  as compared to several factors impacted the pilot salaries  resulting in escalations from  in fiscal to  in  a increase 
pilot turnover in the fourth quarter was exceptionally high due to recruiting and hiring by the major airlines 
because the internal pilot reserve was depleted  the company incurred significant training costs in order to maintain necessary crew levels 
additionally  during the period of crew shortages  flight lines were being covered by existing pilot crews at the higher pay rates due to overtime 
the effect of these factors in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period of is an increase in salaries and training costs of  or 
furthermore  the final two increases under the pilot salary reduction plan were phased in during october  and february  under the plan negotiated with the air line pilots association alpa  pilot salaries were initially reduced by in october   with of the original concession being reinstated after each subsequent four month period 
flight attendant salaries increased or  over the previous fiscal year due to scheduled service increases 
crew travel expenses  encompassing meal allowances and accommodations  remained relatively unchanged at  and  from fiscal year end to  respectively 
in april  four new crew bases were established in lynchburg  virginia  cincinnati  ohio  lexington  kentucky and kinston  north carolina  placing a total of crews at these locations 
while crew bases are designed to reduce crew travel expenses  the savings were not evident for the fiscal year ended june  because of expenses associated with moving the crews 
the escalation of market prices of fuel significantly affected fiscal s fuel expense 
fuel expenditures totaled  in fiscal  and increased to  in  when the average price per gallon of fuel increased from cent to cent 
total fuel consumption was million gallons versus million gallons in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase between years was directly related to the increased service schedule 
fuel expense for includes the cent per gallon federal excise tax on transportation fuels which the company became obligated to pay on october maintenance materials  repairs and overhead experienced an increase over the previous year  from  to  in fiscal the escalation was due exclusively to the increase in annual amortization of engine and gear overhauls from  in to  in from march  through the end of fiscal  expenditures related to overhauls of dash airframe and engine components were  with amortization lives ranging from to months 
amortization of these overhaul additions was the principal factor in the increase in overhaul expense for the fiscal year ended item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued results of operations  continued fiscal  continued ground operations expense increased over  as expenses went from  to  the principal factor in the higher expenses is the increase in us airways handling fees that the company pays as a result of us airways handling the company s passengers in certain markets 
inclement weather in the winter months caused an additional  in aircraft servicing charges in fiscal as compared to  as deicing fluid purchases drastically increased 
advertising  promotion and commissions expense decreased from of passenger revenue in fiscal to of passenger revenue in the reason for this decrease was the revised rate structure for commissions paid to travel agencies  which went into effect during march  commissions paid on travel agency generated tickets decreased from an average of in to in as approximately of tickets collected by the company are written by travel agencies  the savings from this structure change was approximately  partially offsetting this reduction was an increase in reservations fees charged by us airways 
on january   the reservations fee charged changed to a new fee structure resulting in an additional  in expense 
per passenger during the last two quarters of the fiscal year over fees which would have been paid under the old structure 
total general and administrative expenses decreased or  from to contributing to this decrease were reductions in professional fees incurred and property tax assessment adjustments 
professional fees were lower due to the absence of extensive lease and union negotiations that were present during prior years 
property tax assessments have been reduced as of the tax year beginning january   going forward through the revaluation of the aircraft fleet to market value as of the date of filing january  in the company s most significant ad valorem taxing district  north carolina 
this revaluation and other property tax adjustments resulted in savings in calendar of  depreciation and amortization decreased slightly from  in fiscal to  in  as asset additions for rotable flight equipment  ground equipment and leasehold improvements were minimal in fiscal  and thus little depreciation was generated on property additions 
in fiscal  recognition of net operating loss carryforwards offset income tax expense at the statutory rate  but the company s effective federal income tax rate was  which reflects the impact of the alternative minimum tax on operations 
income tax expense was thus  versus in at june  the company had approximately  of united states federal regular tax operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
these carryforwards begin expiring on june  fiscal the operating results for fiscal reflect significant improvement over fiscal year the cost reduction plan initiated by the company was the principal reason for the improvement 
this plan reduced operating costs by  even though capacity  as measured by available seat miles  increased 
the operating expense reductions  while encompassing all functional areas within the company  were focused on the following areas aircraft leases  pilot pay and passenger handling 
operating results also benefitted from the improved yield per revenue passenger mile  which increased from cent in fiscal to cent in fiscal the result of these improvements was operating income of  and a net loss of  as compared to an operating loss of  and net loss of  in fiscal revenues for the years ended june  and were  and  respectively 
the increase in yield in fiscal was the result of industrywide fare increases implemented in the third quarter of fiscal and the elimination of the low fare division of continental  continental lite  in the same period 
continental lite was a direct competitor of us airways and the company in its service area  and us airways reduced fares  including the joint fares shared with the company  to avoid losing market share and to stimulate traffic in the winter of the continental lite pricing and service strategy was eliminated by continental airlines in the third quarter of fiscal  which allowed us airways to alter its pricing strategy and thus resulted in increased yields for the company based upon higher joint fares 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued results of operations  continued fiscal  continued the number of available seat miles asms increased in fiscal over fiscal  primarily as a result of changes in the company s service schedule 
in conjunction with us airways s strategy of eliminating jet service to short haul markets and turning this flying over to us airways express commuter operators  the company initiated all turbo prop service to augusta  georgia in february  and jacksonville  north carolina and lynchburg  virginia in may also during  the company ceased service to several cities it had previously served on a shared basis with us airways from charlotte  north carolina 
these cities were wilmington  north carolina  asheville  north carolina  tri cities  tennessee  columbia  south carolina  huntsville  alabama and knoxville  tennessee 
the net effect of this schedule change was an increase in asms  as fourth quarter capacity increased by over the third quarter and over the same quarter in fiscal the number of revenue passengers carried decreased by and revenue passenger miles rpms decreased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal the primary reason for the reduced passengers and rpms is the elimination of the low fare  traffic stimulation environment which existed in the company s service area until the cessation of continental lite as previously addressed 
operating costs per available seat mile in fiscal declined from cent to cent  as compared to the previous fiscal year 
the increases in fuel  maintenance  advertising  general and administrative and depreciation were more than offset by decreases in flight operations and ground operations 
flight operations expense decreased by in fiscal to  compared to  in fiscal the principal reason for this reduction was a decrease in aircraft lease expense 
see discussion below under liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  pilots salaries and related costs decreased in fiscal as a result of the implementation of a salary reduction plan negotiated with the air line pilots association alpa 
the reduced pay levels began in october and will be phased back in over sixteen months 
the plan entailed an initial pay reduction in october after each subsequent four month period  an additional of the initial reduction was reinstated until february  at which time the salaries reverted to the levels prior to october  the company has previously estimated that the alpa agreement would result in savings of approximately  from october  through january  at present staffing levels  of which  would be realized in fiscal the actual savings were  which differed from the projection due to the increased block hours flown due to the service schedule increase in the fiscal fourth quarter 
crew travel expenses were reduced by  or  in fiscal as a crew base was established in augusta  georgia  to decrease crew per diem and lodging expenses 
a jacksonville  north carolina crew base was established in august  efficient utilization of pilots allowed the company to operate the increased capacity without adding new pilots  thus pilot training costs consisted only of recurrent training 
this efficiency enabled the company to reduce crew training costs by  or 
flight attendant salaries and related costs increased  or  due to scheduled service increases  and hull insurance expense increased  or  due to rate increases 
fuel and oil expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the average cost per gallon of fuel into plane decreased to cent in from cent in  reflecting the continued savings to the company from the purchase of fuel through a us airways subsidiary 
total fuel consumption was million gallons in fiscal versus million gallons in fiscal the increase from year to year was a direct result of increased levels of operations 
maintenance materials  repairs and overhead increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the higher costs were attributable to an increase in the number of flight hours flown  however  the cost of maintenance repairs and materials per asm in fiscal was cent compared to cent per asm in fiscal item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued results of operations  continued fiscal  continued ground operations expense decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal in july of  us airways increased handling fees that the company pays for its passengers 
at this time the company was paying per passenger handled by us airways 
in march of  the company assumed responsibility for ground operations at concourse d at the charlotte douglas international airport in conjunction with the implementation of cost cutting measures by us airways 
the company assumed the responsibility for the salaries and benefits of the concourse d employees  and in return received  per month from us airways and a reduction in passenger handling fees to per passenger 
in january of  the company s reimbursement rate for operating concourse d increased to  per month 
in march   the per passenger handling fee charged by us airways increased to and increased to in july  the reduction in ground operations expenses  while primarily due to the concourse d realignment  was also due to operational efficiencies experienced at other stations operated by the company 
advertising  promotion and commissions expense increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a increase 
this increase is directly related to the passenger revenue increase  as these expenses as a percentage of passenger revenue remained constant  of revenue in fiscal and of revenue in fiscal general and administrative expense increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to passenger liability and property insurance increases of  or 
passenger liability rate increases more than offset the reduction in passengers and the resultant decrease in rpms 
depreciation and amortization increased from  in fiscal to  in  primarily as a result of increased depreciation on rotable flight equipment reclassified from inventory in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s cash needs result from continuing operations including capital expenditures necessary to the operation of its aircraft  and the continuing payment of creditors in accordance with its plan of reorganization 
the plan of reorganization was consummated in september  pursuant to bankruptcy proceedings initated by the company 
during fiscal the company satisfied its cash requirements through internally generated funds and borrowings under a revolving line of credit agreement with an affiliate of an aircraft manufacturer  secured by all of the company s accounts receivable 
the company also utilized short term loans from certain directors and officers secured by owned flight equipment  a line of credit with centura bank  and through the deferral of certain scheduled lease payments to satisfy its cash needs 
plan of reorganization and other restructuring in september  the company and jet acceptance corporation jaco restructured the entire remaining amount due to jaco under the bankruptcy plan  including the august  installment of  the amount due was approximately  net of  discount at as of june  under this agreement  the company issued a promissory note to jaco in the principal amount of  payable in forty eight equal monthly installments of  consisting of principal and interest  beginning on january  additionally  the remaining balance due under the bankruptcy plan of  was satisfied in december  with the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock to jaco 
the company is required to make payments of  to unsecured creditors in annual installments in the first quarter of each fiscal year until the company intends to make these payments when due 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued liquidity and capital resources  continued financing during fiscal the company had available a line of credit the line in an amount not to exceed  from british aerospace asset management baam 
baam is an affiliate of jaco and british aerospace holdings  inc  the company that had previously collateralized the company s bank line through a loan purchase agreement 
the line permits the company to borrow up to of a borrowing base  which consists of the company s transportation and nontransportation charges to airlines clearing house  inc ach or such greater amount as baam shall determine  but in no event more than  the line is secured by all of the company s accounts receivable  bears interest at prime and was scheduled to terminate on december   but must be extended by baam for successive one year periods until december  subsequent to june   baam increased the maximum credit available to  in conjunction with this increase in the maximum credit available  baam agreed to extend the termination date of the line until july  and to increase the amount available for borrowing from to of the borrowing base 
in november  the company secured a supplemental line of credit the centura line with its primary banking facility  centura bank 
this is a revolving line of credit not to exceed  based on its original terms 
centura bank did extend this line to  for the months of february through june  the outstanding balance on the centura line accrues interest at an annual rate of prime plus  and terminates september  the maximum amount drawn on the centura line was  with that amount being outstanding on june  during fiscal  the company obtained several short term loans from certain directors and officers 
amounts borrowed under these loans ranged from  to  and earned interest at the rate of ten percent 
the aggregate maximum and average amounts outstanding under these loans were  and  respectively 
in connection with these loans  the company issued to the lending parties options or warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock 
capital expenditures capital expenditures consist of major component overhauls and fixed asset replacement 
capital expenditures in fiscal were  as compared to  in fiscal the increase is primarily due to continued expenditures for engine overhauls on the dash aircraft  these overhauls were completed in june  substantial expenditures on dash engine overhauls are not expected again until fiscal year moderate reductions were experienced in expenditures for rotable parts and aircraft leasehold improvements 
the company projects fiscal capital expenditures to be approximately  providing consummation of the fleet restructuring plan as described under proposed transactions 
the components of the capital budget are  of engine overhauls   of airframe and landing gear overhauls on the company s aircraft and  for other capital items 
operating cash flow the company receives payments for airline tickets under interline agreements through the airlines clearing house one month in arrears 
historically  this payment in arrears has caused significant cash flow problems in the last half of each month 
the company has a line of credit with baam to provide a steady cash flow between ach settlements 
the company believes that the restructuring stated above and improved revenue environment will provide sufficient cash flows to provide for continuing operations  capital expenditures and scheduled debt and bankruptcy payments absent adverse changes in current market conditions 
if operating cash flows and the line are insufficient to meet obligations  the company has these financing sources available issuance of stock  short term loans from officers and directors  extending terms with trade creditors and restructuring aircraft lease payments 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued liquidity and capital resources  continued operating cash flow  continued the company received the june airlines clearing house ach payment on the scheduled settlement date of june  however  because the first business day subsequent to receipt of funds was july   the company maintained possession of the full settlement amount of  as of june  ordinarily  baam receives payments from the settlement on the first business day subsequent to the transfer to satisfy the line balance  plus interest of  at june  and accrued aircraft lease payments due to jaco  with the remaining funds to the company s account 
other short term liabilities settled from the residual funds on july  included the centura line of  plus interest of  and outstanding loans from company directors and officers in the amount of  accounts receivable decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease is due to lower passenger revenue in june  versus june  attributable primarily to a decrease in passenger traffic from june of compared to june  other noncurrent assets increased from  in fiscal to  in as prepayments for component overhauls expected to be completed in a time period greater than the next twelve months increased by  between the respective balance sheet dates 
accounts payable remained stable at  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal due to similar timing of the monthly clearing house settlement 
notes payable  including current maturities  decreased from  in fiscal to  in as a result of scheduled debt payments 
proposed transactions the company and its advisors  barlow partners  have determined that the elimination of the shorts aircraft from the fleet would positively impact the operating results of the company 
long term savings would be achieved in the areas of reduced spare parts inventories  reduced personnel training expenses  and reduced lease rates per flight hour 
the company would also realize improvements in performance measures such as on time departures and arrivals  denied boardings and flight cancellations 
to this end  the company is currently in negotiations with the aircraft lessor to terminate the shorts leases and return the aircraft 
in return  the company is proposing to issue a subordinated note  convertible to common stock 
under the terms of the proposed transaction  principal payments on the note would be paid in either cash or stock at the company s discretion 
interest would begin accruing from the date of the agreement  and although interest is required to be paid in cash  the first interest payment under the note would not be due until january  if the transaction is consummated  the face amount of the note is projected to be approximately  this amount would encompass approximately  of liabilities accrued leases and notes payable currently recorded in the company s financial statements at june  under this proposed transaction  the company anticipates having to meet certain return conditions  which would entail performing two engine overhauls approximately  in the aggregate 
the company has the same sources of cash to meet the return conditions as it does to fund continuing operations  as outlined above 
the company is also currently negotiating with baam to return its entire jetstream fleet and acquire super aircraft under lease 
under the terms of the proposed transaction  in return for leasing super aircraft through december   the company would be able to reduce its rental payments on jetstream aircraft by approximately  per month per aircraft 
while both aircraft have seats  the super aircraft are approximately five years newer than the jetstream aircraft which average years of age  resulting in reduced maintenance expense and other savings based on operational factors 
the super aircraft are also faster  more fuel efficient and operate with less weight restrictions than their precursors 
while the jetstream leases have return conditions which must be satisfied  the company s cash outlays related to these return conditions are projected to be less than  the company is also attempting to acquire six additional super aircraft to meet short term operating needs 
the leases on these six incremental aircraft are not anticipated to exceed one year in duration from inception and are projected to be at the same lease rate as the aircraft described above 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued liquidity and capital resources  continued other on december   us airways notified the company that it was amending the service agreement between us airways and the company to change the method for the division of revenue on joint fares effective with tickets used on or after july  the implementation of this service agreement amendment has been delayed 
us airways is still studying the ramifications of this amendment and the ultimate timing of the implementation of this plan  if it is implemented at all  is uncertain 
preliminary analysis by the company indicates that us airways will capture an additional of revenues presently allocated to the company if and when the plan is implemented
