under the terms of the agreement  the company will purchase million shares at per share  and an investment group consisting of vestar equity partners  lp  harvard private capital group  american industrial partners capital fund ii  lp and certain members of company management will acquire the remaining million shares at the same price 
the transaction is conditioned upon  among other things  obtaining approval of the company s senior note holders

the pro forma disclosures reflect this subsequent event also described in note to the financial statements whereby the company agreed to repurchase million shares of its common stock at an estimated cost of per share and fund the transaction  including fees  with additional borrowings of million 
the transaction was approved by the company s board of directors on march  and is expected to be completed by march  pro forma for stock actual re purchase in thousands borrowings under the amended bank credit agreement term loans   revolving credit notes   senior notes  due   note payable pulse acquisition   total   required principal payments   total estimated debt service including interest   the company s primary source of liquidity  other than operations  is the million revolving credit facility under the company s credit agreement  as amended million on a pro forma basis

to  based on wabco s interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio 
interest is payable periodically 
in addition  the company must pay certain fees to the administrative agents and participating lending institutions  including a commitment fee of 
on the unborrowed amount of the term loans and revolving loans 
in order to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on this variable rate debt the company has entered into interest rate swaps with three different lenders in the aggregate amount of million 
these agreements effectively change the company s interest rate exposure from variable to fixed rates ranging from to 
these agreements expire in and the amended credit agreement limits the company with respect to declaring or making cash dividend payments and prohibits the declaration or making of other distributions whether in cash  property  securities or a combination thereof  with respect to any shares of the company s capital stock 
however  the company is permitted to pay 
quarterly dividends on the common stock  subject to certain conditions 
the amended credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including  without limitation  the following a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  a limitation on mergers  consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions other than mergers and consolidations with certain subsidiaries  sales of assets in the ordinary course of business  and acquisitions requiring wabco to pay million or less in any fiscal year and million or less in the aggregate  respectively  a limitation on liens  a limitation on certain debt payments  a limitation on capital expenditures  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio

the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future indebtedness under i capitalized lease obligations  ii the amended credit agreement  iii indebtedness of the company for money borrowed and iv indebtedness evidenced by notes  debentures  bonds or other similar instruments for the payment of which the company is responsible or liable unless  in the case of clause iii or iv  in the instrument creating or evidencing the same or pursuant to which the same is outstanding  it is provided that such obligations are subordinate in right of payment to the notes collectively  senior indebtedness 
the company s indenture  pursuant to which the notes were issued  contains certain restrictive covenants which  among other things  limit the ability of the company and certain of its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness  pay dividends on and redeem capital stock  create restrictions on investments in unrestricted subsidiaries  make distributions from certain subsidiaries  use proceeds from the sale of assets and subsidiary stock  enter into transactions with affiliates  create liens and enter into sale leaseback transactions

as partial payment for the pulse acquisition  the company issued the million long term pulse seller note  due january  interest is payable semiannually  and accrues until february  at the per annum rate of  from february  until january   interest will accrue at the prime rate charged by chase manhattan bank on december  plus  from february  until january   interest will accrue at the prime rate charged by chase manhattan bank on december  plus 
the esop loan had an original term of years  with annual payments of principal and interest of approximately million 
as a result of the inclusion of the us vapor salaried employees  the term of the esop loan will be reduced 
the esop loan bears interest at per annum 
the esop will repay the esop loan using contributions from the company 
the company is obligated to contribute amounts sufficient to repay the esop loan 
the net effect of the esop is that the company s stock is allocated to employees in lieu a retirement plan that was previously a cash based defined benefit plan  and accordingly results in reduced cash outlays by an estimated to million annually 
in conjunction with a plan approved on november  to repurchase up to one million shares of common stock  the company had purchased  shares at an aggregate cost of approximately million through december  management believes  based upon current levels of operations and forecasted earnings  that cash flow from operations  together with borrowings under the amended credit agreement  will be adequate to make payments of principal and interest on debt  including the notes  to make required contributions to the esop  to permit anticipated capital expenditures  and to fund working capital requirements and other cash needs 
nevertheless  the company will remain leveraged to a significant extent and its debt service obligations will continue to be substantial 
if the company s sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company s cash requirements  the company may need to refinance its existing debt or obtain additional financing 
there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available  and  in any case  such new financing if available would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place 
environmental matters and product liability based on available information  environmental matters and product liability claims do not presently represent material contingencies to the company 
see note to the company s december  consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation  seasonality general price inflation has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations 
some of the company s labor contracts contain negotiated salary and benefit increases and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses which would cause the company s cost automatically to increase if inflation were to become significant 
the company s business is not seasonal  although the third quarter results generally tend to be slightly lower than other quarters  reflecting vacation and down time at its major customers during this period
