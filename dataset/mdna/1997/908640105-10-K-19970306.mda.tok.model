c information regarding indonesian reserves relates to the company s net interest in a production sharing contract between the indonesian joint venture and pertamina 
the joint venture has no ownership interest in the reserves but does have the right to share revenues and production and is entitled to recover most field and other operating costs and capital depreciation 
the reserve estimates  which are based on year end prices  are subject to revision as product prices and costs fluctuate due to the cost recovery feature under the production sharing contract 
the impact on reserves is inversely related to price changes and directly related to changes in field operating and capital costs 
in addition  reserve estimates are subject to revision due to the effect that price fluctuations generally have on estimates of recoverable reserves 
debt relating to the lng processing facilities owned by pertamina is contractually required to be serviced from proceeds of lng sales prior to the distribution of such proceeds primarily to the members of the joint venture  pertamina and the other production sharing contractors 
the debt obligation is not the obligation of the joint venture 
debt service relating to such facilities is accounted for in the company s reserve estimates as a cost of production and operation 
such debt service is deducted in estimating future net revenues to be distributed among pertamina and the production sharing contractors  including the joint venture and the company s interest therein

alba field 
in july  the company acquired a working and revenue interest in the central uk north sea s block  which includes the alba oil field  for million 
the alba field has been developed using a fixed platform located in the northern part of the field from which oil is pumped to a permanently moored floating storage unit three miles away 
a dedicated shuttle tanker transports oil to refineries in the uk and continental europe 
at year end  proved reserves net for the alba field were mmbbls of oil  of which mmbbls are classified as proved undeveloped 
the company anticipates recording additional proved reserves based on the field s production history and future development activity 
the alba field  which commenced production in january  is expected to produce for over years with production to reach peak levels in and average daily production net to the company for was mbbls of oil 
during  alba s production capacity was expanded to handle over  gross barrels of oil a day 
chevron uk limited operates the field 
production from the alba field is subject to uk corporation tax and the uk petroleum revenue tax prt  but is not subject to uk royalty 
britannia field 
in  the company acquired a unit interest in the undeveloped britannia natural gas and condensate field  a portion of which underlies the alba field  in the uk north sea for million 
the company s total share of development costs for its interest in the britannia field is estimated to be less than million  at current exchange rates  over a five year period from to as of december   the company has spent million  of which million was spent in  for drilling activities and initial platform fabrication and facilities work and expects to spend approximately million in the britannia field is operated by britannia operator limited  a joint venture between conoco uk limited and chevron uk limited 
production from britannia is expected to begin in late with a production life of approximately years 
long term agreements have been reached to sell a substantial portion of the gas production in the uk market to kinetica limited  mobil gas marketing uk limited  national power plc and total gas marketing limited 
the gas production will be processed at the sage terminal in st 
fergus in northeastern scotland  which will be expanded by the sage owners to accommodate the britannia production 
a pipeline will be constructed by the britannia owners to transport the production from britannia to the sage terminal 
also  a condensate line from britannia to the forties field is scheduled for completion in as of december   proved undeveloped reserves net for the britannia field were mmboe  which included mmboe of reserve additions as a result of successful development drilling in the company anticipates recording additional proved reserves based on the field s development results and future production history 
production from the britannia field will be subject to the uk corporation tax  but will not be subject to uk royalty or prt 
piper and claymore fields 
in  the company joined a consortium of companies  of which elf exploration uk plc is now the operator  to explore for oil and gas in certain areas of the north sea 
the company has a working interest revenue interest after government royalty in the piper and claymore fields discovered in and  respectively 
production from piper and claymore originally began in late and late  respectively 
after being shut down in july  claymore recommenced in  and piper recommenced in from a new fixed platform piper b 
oil production from the fields is transferred miles via the joint venture s pipeline to the flotta terminal 
the proved reserves net as of december   contained in the piper and claymore fields were mmboe and mmboe  respectively 
average daily production of oil and liquids net to the company for from the piper and claymore fields was mbbls and mbbls  respectively 
saltire  chanter and iona are satellite fields to piper  and scapa is a satellite field to chanter 
saltire field 
the company has a working and revenue interest in the saltire field  which was discovered by the joint venture in the field was developed using a fixed platform connected subsea to the piper b platform 
the saltire platform was completed and production began in may average daily production net to the company for was mbbls of oil and liquids 
proved reserves net at december   for saltire were mmboe 
chanter field 
the company has a working and revenue interest in the chanter field  which is comprised of two reservoirs  one oil and the other natural gas and condensate 
production from the chanter field began in may the chanter field was developed as a subsea satellite to the piper b platform 
average daily production net to the company for was bbls of oil and liquids 
the proved reserves net at december   for chanter were mmboe 
iona field 
the company has a working and revenue interest in the iona field  which is a small edge oil field discovered in following development of the saltire field and advances in extended reach drilling  the field is being developed by drilling deviated wells from the saltire platform 
government approval of the development plan was received in october the first well commenced production in late january production will be from three separate reservoirs 
it is anticipated that the production data from testing of the first well will lead to a staged development of other nearby fault blocks that are known to contain oil within the iona field boundary 
scapa field 
the scapa field  in which the company has a working and revenue interest  was discovered in and is produced using a subsea production facility tied to the claymore platform 
average daily production net to the company for was mbbls of oil and liquids 
proved reserves net at december   for the scapa field were mmboe 
the piper and claymore fields are currently subject to prt at a statutory rate  which is based on the net value of oil and gas produced from each field and on pipeline tariffs 
the uk tax structure has encouraged development of fields in the north sea by exempting all or part of their production from prt 
these fields  such as the saltire  chanter and scapa fields  are referred to as edge oil fields because they generally have separate field designations  incur little or no prt  have no government royalty interest burden and are developed as satellites from an existing platform 
it is anticipated that only small amounts of prt  if any  will be paid on the production from these fields 
all production from any field receiving development consent after march   such as the britannia and iona fields  is exempt from prt 
production exempted from prt provides a greater contribution to cash flow on a per barrel basis 
all production is subject to the uk corporation tax  which is at the current rate of effective rate after benefits provided by the uk us tax treaty 
under current uk us tax law  the prt and uk corporation tax may be credited against uk taxes 
sean fields 
the company has a working interest revenue interest after overriding royalty in the north  south and east sean gas fields located in the southern portion of the uk north sea and operated by shell uk limited 
the proved reserves net as of december   contained in the fields were mmboe 
the sean platforms  which currently serve the north  south and east sean fields  made their first deliveries in december under the terms of a long term gas sales contract with british gas trading limited bgt  an assignee of british gas plc bg  the company will deliver  during each winter contract period  an average minimum of bcf net to the company from the north and south sean fields  up to the maximum field contractual reserve of bcf bcf net to the company 
this peak shaving gas sales agreement also provides that currently proved gas reserves from the north and south sean fields are dedicated to the buyer 
the price under the gas sales agreement is based upon the volume of gas taken and various uk price indices 
the average price for was per mcf 
during the fall and winter months  the company also earns a capacity charge  which is independent of production levels  to ensure field deliverability of mmcf gross per day 
the capacity charge for totaled million net to the company  and the revenue for the volume of gas taken on days of production was million net to the company 
production from the north and south sean fields is subject to uk corporation tax and prt  but is not subject to uk royalty 
discovered in  the east sean field is separated from the producing reservoirs of the north and south sean fields  and as a result  production from the east sean field is not dedicated to the peak shaving contract with bgt 
during  the company s share of gas from the east sean field was sold  on the uk s short term gas market  to a number of companies 
average daily production net to the company for was mmcf per day 
production from the east sean field is subject to uk corporation tax but is not subject to uk royalty or prt 
customers 
for  the company s uk operations had crude oil sales at prevailing market prices to elf trading  a major international oil and gas company  equal to of the company s total sales and operating revenues 
because of the market for northwest european crude oil  the company believes that the loss of this customer would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has not been involved in any negotiations with bg in relation to bg s publicly declared strategy to renegotiate its gas purchase agreements with producers in the uk as part of its corporate reorganization  bg transferred its gas supply business into a new public subsidiary company named centrica plc centrica  which has resulted in the company s north and south sean fields and piper area gas purchase agreements being assigned to bgt  a subsidiary of centrica 
the company cannot predict what effect  if any  such actions will have on the company

indonesia the company is engaged in oil and gas exploration  development and production in indonesia  primarily through a joint venture group it joined in under a production sharing contract with pertamina  the indonesian national oil company  which currently covers approximately million acres  the joint venture produces gas and  to a lesser extent  oil and condensate  in the sanga sanga block in the east kalimantan area 
substantially all of the natural gas produced by the joint venture is supplied  pursuant to long term contracts with pertamina  to a liquefaction plant owned by pertamina at bontang bay  approximately miles from the production areas 
at the bontang plant  gas is converted into lng in parallel processing units trains by reducing the temperature of the gas to approximately minus degrees celsius 
the bontang plant currently has six trains in operation  and construction of the seventh train by pertamina is scheduled for completion in late the financing of an eighth train is expected to be consummated in march and construction is expected to begin in after conversion  the lng is pumped into specially designed tankers owned by third parties and transported to purchasers in the pacific rim  where it is returned to its original gaseous form and used for fuel by electric utilities and industry 
the bontang plant also processes lpg 
production sharing contract and drilling 
the joint venture s production sharing contract with pertamina grants the joint venture the right to share in the production and revenues from the contract area  but not ownership rights in the oil and gas reserves 
the joint venture s contract area in east kalimantan includes substantial portions of two fields  badak and nilam  as well as several other fields 
the joint venture has relinquished of the area covered by the production sharing contract since when the contract was extended and is required to relinquish the following additional amounts of the area covered by the contract by august   by december   by december   and by december  the joint venture  however  is not obligated to relinquish any area from which oil or natural gas is produced 
the production sharing contract originally expired in  but in  pertamina and the joint venture amended the production sharing contract and extended the joint venture s right to explore  develop and produce oil and gas in the contract area until through a second production sharing contract  containing terms and conditions generally similar to the amended production sharing contract 
references herein to the production sharing contract mean the production sharing contract in effect for the applicable time period 
the production sharing contract entitles the joint venture participants to recover most field and other operating costs  as well as capital depreciation  and to receive  net of indonesian taxes  of the remaining gas production until august  and or  depending upon the applicable sales contract  with some exceptions  of such production for the remaining term of the contract 
the production sharing contract also entitles the joint venture participants to take their respective shares of oil and condensate production in kind  and after recovering operating expenses and capital depreciation  to retain of the proceeds from sales of such production  net of indonesian taxes 
proceeds from the sale of oil and condensate except for that sold pursuant to the joint venture s domestic market obligation discussed below are currently based on official indonesian crude oil prices and reflect world market prices 
the company owns a working interest in the joint venture directly and through subsidiaries of unimar  the equity partnership 
the company s indirect interest is subject to the right of holders of unimar s indonesian participating units ipus to receive a percentage of certain cash flow resulting from unimar s interest in the joint venture until september   at which time the ipus will expire with no residual value to the holder 
in  approximately one fourth of the company s interest in such cash flow of unimar was burdened by such payment obligation 
virginia indonesia company  a participant in the joint venture and a subsidiary of unimar  acts as operator of the joint venture 
the vote of participants holding of the total joint venture ownership interest is generally required for approval of significant matters pertaining to the joint venture 
at december   proved reserves net attributable to the company s total interest in the joint venture were approximately tcf of gas and mmbbls of oil and condensate 
for a discussion of factors that impact indonesian reserve estimates  see reserves above and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
substantially all of the joint venture s natural gas production and reserves are committed to several long term supply agreements with pertamina  which obligate the joint venture to supply certain minimum quantities of natural gas 
the company believes that there are adequate reserves in the joint venture s production sharing contract area to supply natural gas under the joint venture s contractual commitments outstanding as of december  pertamina continues to make progress in marketing additional lng volumes 
the percentage of the natural gas supplied by the joint venture in support of future lng or lpg sales contracts  or renewals or extensions of existing long term sales contracts  is dependent primarily upon the uncommitted reserves of natural gas that the joint venture has in its production sharing contract area at the time that pertamina establishes the allocation of the natural gas supply for such sales contracts among the various contractor groups in the east kalimantan area  which participation percent has decreased 
see sales contracts below 
in and  and successful development wells  respectively  were drilled in fields in east kalimantan 
during  the company expects to spend approximately million on development projects 
in addition  the joint venture plans to continue exploration efforts in by seismic data acquisition and exploratory drilling 
the joint venture also continues to evaluate the east kalimantan area to identify additional oil and gas prospects 
all of these expenditures will be cost recoverable pursuant to the production sharing contract 
the joint venture participants are required collectively to sell approximately of the total oil and condensate production from most existing fields in the contract area at per barrel for domestic indonesian consumption 
the domestic market obligation is suspended  however  for the first months of production from new fields in the contract area  after which the price will be of the realized indonesian export price 
these obligations are factored into the company s net reserves estimates 
each participant s remaining oil and condensate production is generally sold in world oil markets 
in addition to the oil and condensate sold for domestic use  the joint venture supplies gas for domestic consumption  and the amount supplied for such purposes may increase or decrease in the future 
profits from gas supplied for domestic consumption  which was sold at an average price of per mcf in  are less than from gas supplied for lng 
gas supplied for domestic consumption constituted less than of the joint venture s gas production during bontang plant 
at the bontang plant  natural gas supplied by the joint venture and other production sharing contractors is converted to lng  and shipped in lng tankers cargoes 
these specially designed tankers vary in size  and the term cargo as used herein means  cubic meters of lng 
during  the completion of the debottlenecking project on the first four trains and the completion of the sixth train increased the production capacity of the bontang plant  which currently has limited unused processing capacity 
see sales contracts below for more information 
the amount of revenue that the company receives as a result of the production of natural gas in support of the sale of lng by pertamina is dependent upon the number of cargoes shipped each year  the company s ultimate participation in each cargo  the price the buyers must pay for the lng purchased and the costs to be deducted from the proceeds of sales of lng 
the bontang plant is owned by pertamina and operated on a cost reimbursement basis by a corporation owned in part by the joint venture 
the financing of the original two trains was repaid in  and the financing for the second two trains was repaid in financing for construction of the fifth train at the bontang plant was provided principally from japanese sources through a funding arrangement under which debt service is paid to the lenders by the trustee as defined below from the proceeds of lng sales  primarily under the contract signed in with chinese petroleum corporation cpc  the national oil company of the republic of china taiwan 
final repayment is scheduled in in  pertamina arranged million under a similar financing arrangement for the construction of the sixth train and associated facilities at the bontang plant 
construction began in and was completed in late at a cost of approximately million 
repayment began in from proceeds of the osaka contract as defined below  and final repayment is scheduled in in july  a million financing was completed for the seventh train  third dock  lpg expansion and other support facilities 
the financing was provided from japanese sources through arrangements similar to those used to finance the bontang plant s fifth and sixth trains 
repayment is scheduled to begin in principally from the proceeds of the short term lng sales contracts with cpc and korea gas corporation kgc and starting in  from the proceeds of the extension of the contract 
the construction of the seventh train began in and is scheduled for completion in late in march  the  million financing of the eighth train to support the new sales contracts discussed below is expected to be consummated and construction is expected to begin in financing of the fifth  sixth  seventh trains are  and the eighth train will be  nonrecourse to both pertamina and the joint venture 
sales contracts 
the joint venture currently has gas supply agreements with pertamina that support the long term and short term lng sales contracts and obligate the joint venture to provide certain quantities of natural gas for fulfillment of pertamina s obligations pursuant to the lng sales contracts 
the supply agreements terminate concurrently with the expirations of their respective lng sales contracts 
the company s right to receive revenues from the sale of lng and lpg under existing contracts as well as any future new contracts or extensions or renewals of existing contracts is affected by the allocation of the gas supply obligation in support of pertamina s sales contracts among the joint venture and the other production sharing contractors supplying gas to the bontang plant  which allocations vary among the sales contracts 
this allocation is set by pertamina and is primarily based upon uncommitted reserves of natural gas available at the time pertamina makes the allocation 
the allocation to the company s joint venture in such contracts has declined over time since the initial sales contract allocation at  when the joint venture was virtually the only supplier to the bontang plant  to the present when there are two other major production sharing contractors supplying gas to the bontang plant and sharing in the allocation of volumes 
in and  bcf and bcf  respectively  net to the company  were delivered to pertamina under these supply agreements 
production for the joint venture in indonesia has peaked 
the joint venture s share  which also includes the company s net interest  in lng volumes from the bontang plant is expected to decline in by approximately as compared to primarily due to a reduction in deliveries under the initial contract in which the joint venture has a high allocation interest 
the effect of such lower gas supplies will not have as significant an impact on the company s total annual cash flow 
a further decline in the joint venture s participation percentage in lng volumes is expected in see the table below for more information 
lng is currently sold by pertamina to two groups of japanese industrial and utility customers and to cpc under long term contracts signed in  and  respectively 
additionally  sales of lng began in november under a long term contract signed in with a consortium of buyers organized by osaka gas  a japanese utility the osaka contract 
lng is also sold by pertamina under additional long term contracts with kgc signed in and the korean carryover and korea ii contracts  respectively and under the long term mid cities gas companies mcgc contract signed in some of the added capacity from the expansion of the lng facilities during is also used to supply lng sold under short term contracts to japanese  korean and taiwanese buyers 
the sales price under the lng sales contracts is tied to an average of prices for exported indonesian crude oil 
in  pertamina finalized agreements to extend the lng contracts originally signed in and until and  respectively 
pertamina also signed agreements for two new long term lng sales contracts with cpc badak vi and kgc badak v  which provide for lng sales from until to support the supply of the additional quantities of lng required primarily by the extended contract  pertamina is currently constructing the seventh train with completion scheduled in late following consummation of the financing expected in march  construction of an eighth train is expected to begin in  primarily to support the supply of quantities of lng required by the new cpc and kgc long term contracts 
the and contracts including extensions thereof and the cpc  cpc badak vi  osaka  korean carryover  korea ii  kgc badak v and mcgc contracts collectively  the long term contracts contain take or pay provisions that generally require that the purchasers either take the contracted quantities or pay for such quantities even if not taken 
prior to any extensions  the initial term of each long term contract is approximately years 
the other contracts described in the table below are short term contracts and generally have a term of ten years or less

bontang plant processing fees  debt service with respect to plant financings  transportation as required and other costs are deducted from sales proceeds  and the balance is then distributed to pertamina  the members of the joint venture and the other production sharing contractors 
at december   the average lng price under all contracts supplied from the bontang plant was per mmbtu  or per mcf 
prices under the contracts are subject to monthly adjustments 
as of december   january   and march   the average price for the group of crude oils used to determine the price of lng was  and per bbl  respectively 
the company is unable to predict the amount or timing of future changes in the price of this group of crude oils 
every change in the average of the price of this group of crude oils results in approximately a per mcf change in the price of lng 
pertamina also sells lpg produced at the lpg processing facilities at the bontang plant under seven contracts with japanese purchasers  each of which is for a ten year term 
in  the bontang plant is expected to deliver an aggregate of up to  metric tons of lpg mmboe per year to support these contracts 
the joint venture currently has and participations in the gas processed at the bontang plant to supply quantities of lpg to be sold under the lpg contracts 
pertamina may from time to time sell quantities of lpg outside of the seven lpg contracts  and to the extent that such sales are made  the joint venture currently will have a participation in the gas processed at the bontang plant to supply those additional sales

production from the concession began during the company has a working interest revenue interest in the concession area 
concession 
the exploration license granted by the pakistan government in under the badin ii concession expired in january in december  the joint venture and the pakistan government signed a new petroleum concession agreement the concession 
the concession provides that the exploration license will expire in january and that the company will act as operator and will bear of the costs of exploration  including attributable to the pakistan government 
under the concession  the company will explore for and develop oil and gas on the million acres in the badin area not covered by leases granted under the concession or the concession 
as discoveries are made  the joint venture will apply for individual year leases in which the company will have a working interest revenue interest  provided the pakistan government elects to exercise its option to increase its working interest in each such discovery to 
the pakistan government is contractually obligated under the and concession agreements to issue leases upon the determination of a commercial discovery and the fulfillment by the joint venture of the conditions of the concession agreements and the exploration license 
proved reserves net at december   for the company s interest in the badin concessions were mmbbls of oil and bcf of gas

petrochemicals plant operations 
the company s petrochemical business consists primarily of the company s interest in the jointly owned geismar olefins plant located on the mississippi river near baton rouge  louisiana 
the joint owners are basf corporation with a interest and ge petrochemicals  inc with a interest 
the plant began operations in the company operates the plant  with production costs and plant production being shared by the three joint owners according to their ownership interests 
the plant has the capacity to produce approximately billion gross pounds million net of ethylene and million gross pounds million net of polymer grade propylene annually 
in  the company reported plans to construct a thirteenth ethylene furnace at the plant 
as part of the construction project  the company also will upgrade nine of the facility s furnaces 
construction of the new furnace and upgrading of the nine original furnace units is expected to begin in may and be completed in february the new furnace is scheduled to commence start up operations in the fourth quarter of the additional furnace is expected to increase the plant s annual production capacity by about million gross pounds  or  to approximately billion gross pounds million net 
the total cost of the new furnace and upgrading project is estimated to be approximately million gross million net to the company 
in and  the company s net ethylene sales were million pounds and million pounds  respectively  and its net propylene sales were million pounds and million pounds  respectively 
the company sells its share of the ethylene produced by the plant to a number of major customers for the manufacture of plastics used in various consumer products 
the sales price of ethylene averaged per pound in and per pound in sales of propylene  used in the manufacture of various products such as building materials  clothing and tires  averaged per pound and per pound in and  respectively 
during  the average margin per pound of the company s ethylene was per pound as compared to per pound for the company s ethylene margin is primarily affected by the price received for the ethylene and the cost of feedstock natural gas liquids and natural gas 
capital expenditures for the petrochemical business were million net to the company during the company plans to spend million net to the company in capital expenditures for the petrochemical business during  which include costs for the th furnace and an upgrade to the feedstock supply system as well as other projects to enhance production  safety and efficiency 
the company completed a two week maintenance turnaround in january storage and transportation 
in addition to the geismar plant  the company owns and operates a mile ethane feedstock pipeline system  which transports feedstock to its ethylene plant from several major suppliers  including the company s natural gas liquids fractionation plant and supporting mile pipeline system in rayne  louisiana 
the company plans to extend this system in to connect with a pipeline system that has access to texas in order to expand the company s market for transporting ethane and other feedstocks from texas to manufacturers in louisiana 
the company also operates underground storage terminals and a mile ethylene pipeline system  portions of which are jointly owned  to serve the geismar facility and several other petrochemical plants primarily in the baton rouge area 
in  the company also intends to participate in pipeline connections to a gas liquids fractionator in napoleonville  louisiana  which has access to new natural gas liquids feedstocks associated with new gulf of mexico gas production 
see risk factors and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other matters insurance 
as is customary in the oil and gas and petrochemical industries  the company reviews its safety equipment and procedures and carries insurance against some  but not all  risks of the business 
see risk factors 
losses and liabilities would reduce revenues and increase costs to the company to the extent not covered by insurance 
the oil and gas and petrochemical businesses can be hazardous  involving unforeseen circumstances such as blowouts  explosions or environmental damage 
to address the hazards inherent in the oil and gas and petrochemical businesses  the company maintains a comprehensive insurance program covering its worldwide interests 
this insurance coverage includes physical damage coverage  third party general liability insurance  as well as redrill  well control  environmental and pollution and other coverage  although coverage for environmental and pollution related losses is subject to significant limitations 
in addition  the company maintains business interruption insurance on its major international oil and gas producing interests and on its petrochemical business 
the scope  terms  retentions  amount and cost of all such insurances vary depending upon various market factors and other considerations 
employees 
as of february   the company had approximately  employees 
the company believes that its relations with its employees are good 
risk factors forward looking statements

when used herein  the words budget  anticipate  expects  believes  seeks  goals  plans  strategy  intends  or projects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those projected by such forward looking statements and no assurance can be given that the expectations will prove correct 
in reliance upon the private securities litigation reform act of  factors identified by the company that could cause the company s future results to differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements include the following risks described under risk factors 
all forward looking statements in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph and shall be deemed in the future to be modified in their entirety by the company s public pronouncements  including those contained in all future reports and other documents filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
volatility of prices and availability of markets 
the company s revenues  profitability and future rate of growth are highly dependent upon the prices of and demand for oil and gas  which can be extremely volatile 
the volatile energy market makes it difficult to estimate future prices and sales volumes of natural gas  crude oil and lng  which are affected by a number of factors beyond the control of the company  including worldwide supplies of and demand for oil and gas  changing international economic and political conditions  contract enforceability  insolvency of other parties  domestic and foreign energy legislation  weather  environmental conditions  regulations and events  and actions of major petroleum producers including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
if oil prices decline  the price for a significant portion of the natural gas produced from the company s properties  including the sales price for lng  will also decline 
the ethylene business is cyclical and the company cannot predict the duration of any trends in the business 
the company s ethylene margins have averaged approximately  and during  and  respectively 
the marketing and prices received by the company for its ethylene petrochemical business are affected by worldwide and us demand for petrochemicals  inventory levels  feedstock costs and availability  plant utilization rates  plant operations and costs and competitive capacity expansion 
the marketability of the company s natural gas  crude oil  lng and ethylene production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of gathering systems and processing facilities 
the company s financial condition  operating results and liquidity may be materially affected by any significant fluctuations in its sales prices 
the company s ability to service its long term obligations and to generate funds internally for capital expenditures will be similarly affected 
business risks 
the company s activities are subject to the risks normally associated with oil and gas operations and petrochemical operations 
the nature of the oil and gas business involves a variety of risks usually associated with exploration for  and development and production and transportation of  oil and gas  including blowouts  cratering  oil spills  fires  geologic uncertainties and adverse or seasonal weather conditions 
offshore operations are also subject to marine perils and extensive governmental regulations  as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental or other considerations 
the company s operations  including its petrochemical operations  are subject to certain additional risks  including the breakdown or failure of equipment  downtime of production units due to turnarounds  the performance of equipment at levels below those originally projected  and explosions  fires  floods and other catastrophic events 
in certain cases  the company is also at risk in regards to any interruptions in related facilities  which are not under its control 
for example  in indonesia  the bontang plant s ability to manufacture and ship quantities of lng is dependent upon the continued operation of the bontang plant without mechanical failure and without the shutdown of any processing units in excess of scheduled maintenance periods 
the sale of lng is also dependent upon the availability of shipping without interruption and upon the continued operation of the buyers receiving terminals 
the manufacture  shipment  receipt and distribution of products produced  sold or distributed by the company  including lng  can be interrupted or adversely impacted by severe weather  acts of nature or other events 
the costs associated with transportation of certain products  including lng  such as repair and maintenance or replacement of lng tankers  are beyond the control of the company 
the occurrence of any of these events could cause injury to life or property  interruptions in operations  failure to produce oil or gas in commercial quantities  inability to fully produce discovered reserves  loss of revenues and margins or increases in the costs of operations 
uncertainties in reserve estimation  production success and reserve replacement 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the producer 
the reserve data set forth in this report represent only estimates 
underground accumulations of oil and gas cannot be measured in an exact way 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates by different engineers often vary 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates at a specific point in time are often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  which differences may be significant 
additionally  the estimates of future net revenues from proved reserves of the company and the present value of future net revenues are based upon certain assumptions about future production levels  prices and costs that may not prove correct over time 
the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the assumptions upon which they were based 
in general  the company s volume of production from oil and gas properties declines with the passage of time 
except to the extent the company acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration or development activities  or both  the proved reserves of the company  and the revenues generated from production thereof assuming no price increases  will decline as reserves are produced 
drilling activities are expensive and subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially viable oil or gas production will be obtained 
the decision to purchase a property interest or explore or develop a property will depend in part on geophysical and geological analysis and engineering studies  the results of which may be inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain 
drilling may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of many factors  including title problems  project approvals by joint venture partners  weather conditions  compliance with government regulation  shortages or delays in obtaining equipment  or limitations in the transportation  storage or market for products 
no assurance can be given that wells will be able to sustain production rates commensurate with the drill stem tests 
increases or decreases in prices of oil and gas and in cost levels  along with the timing of development projects  will also affect revenues generated by the company and the present value of estimated future net cash flows from its properties 
revenues generated from future activities of the company are highly dependent upon the level of success in finding  developing or acquiring additional reserves 
for the company s reserves in indonesia  the reserve estimates  which are based on year end prices  for the company s net interest in the production sharing contract are subject to revision as product prices and costs fluctuate due to the cost recovery feature under the contract 
the impact on reserves is inversely related to price changes and directly related to changes in field operating and capital costs 
in addition  reserves are subject to revision due to the effect that price fluctuations generally have on estimates of recoverable reserves 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s right to receive revenues under its future new sales contracts or extensions of renewals of existing contracts is affected by the gas supply obligation in support of such contracts among the joint venture and other production sharing contractors 
the allocation to the company s joint venture in such contracts has declined significantly over time 
because a substantial portion of the joint venture s reserves of natural gas has been committed to support existing lng sales contracts  the company expects that absent the discovery of significant additional natural gas reserves in the joint venture s contract area  the joint venture s participation in future new sales contracts for lng and lpg  or in extensions or renewals of existing long term contracts  will be less than its current participation in existing contracts 
governmental actions  regulation and taxation 
petroleum and petrochemical operations are subject to various types of regulation throughout the world 
the company believes that its operations and facilities are in general compliance with existing regulations 
nevertheless  the risks of substantive costs and liabilities are inherent in operations such as the company s  and there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future 
legislation affecting these businesses is under regular review for amendment or expansion  frequently increasing the regulatory burden 
for example  statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
also  numerous departments and agencies are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry  the petrochemicals industry and individual members of these industries 
such rules and regulations pose difficult and costly compliance and reporting requirements  some of which carry substantial penalties for the failure to comply 
most of the foreign countries in which the company operates have statutes and regulations governing the company s operations  including the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties  rates of production from oil and gas wells and taxation of sales and production 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry and the petrochemical industry increases the costs of doing business and  consequently  affects profitability 
the company s international operations are subject to certain risks  including expropriation of assets  governmental reinterpretation of applicable laws and contract terms  increases in or assessments of taxes and government royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governments or customers  government approvals of lease  permit or similar applications and of exploration and development plans  political and economic instability  guerilla activity  disputes between governments  payment delays  export and import restrictions  limits on allowable levels of exploration and production and currency shortages  currency rate fluctuations  exchange losses and repatriation restrictions  as well as changes in laws and policies governing operations of companies with overseas operations  including more strict environmental regulation 
in addition  in the event of a dispute arising from foreign operations  the company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the us the company may also be hindered or prevented from enforcing its rights with respect to a governmental instrumentality because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity 
foreign operations and investments may also be subject to laws and policies of the us affecting foreign trade  investment and taxation  including but not limited to credibility of foreign taxes  that could affect the conduct and profitability of those operations 
competition 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
the company actively competes with major and independent energy companies for exploration leases  licenses  concessions and acquisitions of desirable properties as well as for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties and market the products produced 
likewise  the company competes with other large domestic producers of ethylene in product price  product quality  product deliverability and production capacity 
many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources  such as technical capabilities and human resources  substantially greater than those of the company 
in addition  some of the company s competitors have greater experience  especially in certain international areas where the company is currently seeking to acquire interests or expand production capacity 
environmental 
various international  federal  state and local laws and regulations  including the preparation of environmental assessments and impact studies that can delay drilling activity as well as covering the discharge of materials  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  affect the company s operations and costs 
in particular  the company s petrochemical wastes are subject to stringent environmental regulations relating to  among other things  solid and hazardous waste management and disposal  air emissions  waste water treatment and other matters that may affect the environment 
environmental regulations have had an increasing impact upon the company s operations 
the company is committed to managing its operations in a safe and environmentally responsible manner and believes that its operations and facilities are in general compliance with applicable environmental regulations 
environmental capital expenditures for were not material  nor are they expected to be material during nevertheless  the risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in operations such as the company s 
there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred by the company in the future 
the company has  in the past  owned  leased or operated numerous properties in the us that have been used for the production of oil and gas for many years and currently participates in exploration and development activities in alaska 
although the company believes that its past operating and disposal practices were standard in the industry at the time and were generally in compliance with then existing rules and regulations  certain wastes may have been disposed of or released or contamination may have occurred on or under the properties owned  leased or operated by the company 
state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have gradually become more strict 
in addition  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law  and comparable state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
under these laws  the company could be required with respect to past  existing and future properties  to remove or remediate previously disposed of wastes or property contamination including groundwater contamination at onshore locations  to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination or to clean up disposal sites where hazardous substances from its operations have been taken 
the company s foreign operations are similarly subject to foreign laws covering environmental and worker safety matters 
although these laws generally have been less comprehensive than their us counterparts  countries in which the company does business are increasing their environmental regulatory and compliance standards 
the company s operations in the uk are subject to the prevention of oil pollution act  the environmental protection act and related statutes and orders  as well as certain european union agreements 
the foreign laws  however  have not had  and are not presently expected to have  a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
hedging 
the company may enter into hedging contracts from time to time in order to minimize the impact of adverse price fluctuations  including futures contracts 
to the extent the company engages in such activities it may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges 
risks related to hedging activities include the risk that counter parties to hedge transactions will default on obligations to the company 
there are also foreign exchange risks inherent in operations such as the company s 
the company s revenues are predominantly based upon the world market price for crude oil  which is denominated in us dollars 
the functional currency for translating the accounts of the company s foreign subsidiaries is the us dollar  except for subsidiaries in the u 
k 
where the functional currency is pounds sterling 
certain operating costs  taxes  capital costs and intercompany transactions represent commitments settled in foreign currency 
the company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
the company cannot predict with any certainty the results of currency exchange rate fluctuations
