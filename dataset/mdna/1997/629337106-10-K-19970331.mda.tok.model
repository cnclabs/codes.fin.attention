item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the financial statements and the notes thereto and selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
historical operating results and percentage relationships among any amounts included in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period 
overview the company s core business is the manufacture and sale of high quality  precision steel balls and rollers 
in  balls accounted for approximately of the company s net sales  while rollers accounted for the remaining 
although all of the company s net sales from through were exclusively to domestic customers  the company s international sales have increased significantly in recent years and represented approximately of net sales in see note of the notes to financial statements 
significant factors in the company s growth include its displacement of captive ball manufacturing divisions of domestic and international bearing manufacturers as a source of precision balls and increased sales of high precision balls for quiet bearing applications 
from through  the percentage of high precision balls produced by the company for use in quiet bearing applications has increased from approximately to approximately of total net ball sales 
management believes that the company s sales growth has resulted from its ability to capitalize on opportunities in overseas markets and provide precision balls at competitive prices  as well as its emphasis on product quality and customer service

notwithstanding the company s record sales in  the company s foreign sales in the last half of were negatively affected by weak international economies  certain customers excess inventories  and a slowing in the overall rate of outsourcing of captive production 
the company anticipates that its foreign sales will continue to be affected by one or more of these negative factors in in addition  in the fourth quarter of  two of the company s major customers have informed the company of their intention to bring in house in a portion of their business in the aggregate  approximately million in net sales that was previously outsourced to the company

extraordinary item 
in the first quarter of  the company recorded an extraordinary charge of million million net of tax benefit of  related to the early retirement of the senior notes 
the charge consisted of million in prepayment penalties and a non cash charge of  related to the write off of deferred loan costs associated with the borrowings

liquidity and capital resources in march  the company completed an initial public offering of common stock pursuant to which  shares were issued and sold by the company without adjustment for the two three for two stock splits effective on march  and december   respectively 
net proceeds to the company were million net of million underwriters discount and million of related costs 
a portion of these proceeds was used to repay million in principal of the senior notes  as well as accrued interest of  and a related prepayment penalty of million 
approximately million was used to pay a distribution of undistributed earnings to the company s s corporation stockholders 
the distribution consisted of all of the company s previously taxed and undistributed earnings as of march   plus the company s previously undistributed earnings for financial reporting purposes in excess of the previously taxed earnings at march   less a reserve of million for the amount of the deferred income taxes payable on such excess 
the remainder of the proceeds have been used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
in february  the company entered into a modified loan agreement with nationsbank of tennessee na nationsbank which replaced a loan agreement entered into with nationsbank in the first quarter of the loan agreement  as modified  provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million  which will expire on may  amounts outstanding under the revolving facility are unsecured and bear interest at a floating rate equal to  at the company s option  either the nationsbank prime commercial rate minus or libor plus or libor plus if the minimum advance is at least million 
the loan agreement contains customary financial and operating restrictions on the company  including covenants restricting the company  without nationsbank s consent  from pledging its inventory  accounts receivable or other assets to other lenders or from acquiring any other businesses if the aggregate expenditures by the company in connection with such acquisitions would exceed a certain threshold in any fiscal year 
in addition  the company is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividend if an event of default exists under the revolving credit facility at the time of  or would occur as a result of  such declaration or payment 
the loan agreement also contains customary covenants requiring the satisfaction of certain financial tests and the maintenance of certain financial ratios  including covenants requiring the company to maintain a tangible net worth of not less than million  working capital of not less than the greater of million or of revenues  as computed on a rolling month basis  a ratio of total debt divided by net worth of not more than to  and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of not less than to the company is in compliance with all such covenants 
the outstanding principal balance of the company s borrowings under the revolving facility as of december  was million  compared to million at december  the company s arrangements with its domestic customers typically provide that payments are due within days following the date of the company s shipment of goods  while arrangements with foreign customers other than foreign customers that have entered into the company s inventory management program generally provide that payments are due within either or days following the date of shipment 
under the company s inventory management program  sales are recorded when the product is used by the customer  and payments typically are due within days thereafter 
due to the continuing expansion of the company s foreign sales  management believes that the company s working capital requirements will increase as a result of longer payment terms provided to foreign customers 
currently  all foreign sales are billed and paid for in united states dollars 
to date  the company has not been materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations or foreign exchange restrictions 
however  approximately of the steel used by the company is steel  and the company purchases substantially all of its steel requirements from foreign mills because of the lack of domestic producers of such steel at the quality level the company requires 
during  due to an increase in worldwide demand for steel and the decrease in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies  the company experienced an increase in the price of steel and some difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of steel from its existing suppliers 
because of the shortage  the company also incurred increased transportation costs for finished products in order to meet customer delivery requirements 
during  the steel shortage abated and the company was able to obtain an adequate supply of steel on a timely basis 
the company has obtained informal commitments for steel in that exceed its projected usage 
the company typically reserves with its customers the right to increase product prices periodically in the event of increases in its raw material costs 
as the company s international operations continue to grow  foreign exchange risk can be expected to increase  and the company may be required to develop and implement additional strategies  such as entering into foreign currency exchange contracts  to manage this risk 
working capital  which consists principally of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and inventories  was million at december   as compared to million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to at december   from at december  this increase was due primarily to a decrease in accounts payable and amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility 
cash flow from operations increased to million during from million during this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in net income and depreciation 
total capital expenditures for were approximately million  all of which was spent in the purchase of new machinery and equipment for the company s facilities 
these capital expenditures were financed with cash generated from operations and funds available under the credit facility described above 
in january   the company purchased the building and an approximately acre tract of land on which the mountain city  tennessee facility is located  for an aggregate purchase price of  including  of closing fees and related expenses 
during  the company plans to spend an additional million on capital expenditures  including the purchase of additional machinery and equipment for all three of the company s facilities 
the company intends to finance these activities with cash generated from operations and funds available under the credit facility described above 
the company believes that funds generated from operations and borrowings from the credit facility will be sufficient to finance the company s working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements through december in december  the company announced that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock  equaling of the company s issued and outstanding shares as of november  the repurchase program will remain in effect until the earlier of the completion of the purchase of the shares or november  the program may be extended or discontinued at any time  and there is no assurance that the company will repurchase the full amount authorized 
the company did not repurchase any shares under the program during in february  the company repurchased  shares at an aggregate purchase price of  the company believes that funds generated from operations and borrowings from the credit facility will be sufficient to finance any additional stock repurchases under the program 
seasonality and fluctuation in quarterly results the company s net sales historically have not been of a seasonal nature 
however  as foreign sales have increased as a percentage of total sales  seasonality has become a factor for the company in that many foreign customers cease production during the month of august 
for information concerning the company s quarterly results of operations for the years ended december  and  see note of the notes to financial statements 
inflation and changes in prices while the company s operations have not been affected by inflation during recent years  prices for steel and other raw materials purchased by the company are subject to change 
for example  during  due to an increase in worldwide demand for steel and the decrease in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies  the company experienced an increase in the price of steel and some difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of steel from its existing suppliers 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
typically  the company s pricing arrangements with its steel suppliers are subject to adjustment once every six months 
in an effort to limit its exposure to fluctuations in steel prices  the company has generally avoided the use of long term  fixed price contracts with its customers 
instead  the company typically reserves the right to increase product prices periodically in the event of increases in its raw material costs 
the company was able to minimize the impact on its operations resulting from the steel price increases by taking such measures

cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company wishes to caution that this report and the annual report to stockholders contain  and future filings by the company  press releases and oral statements made by the company s authorized representatives may contain  forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements due to important factors bearing on the company s business  many of which already have been discussed in this filing and in the company s prior filings 
the following paragraphs discuss the risk factors that the company regards as the most significant  although the company wishes to caution that other factors that currently are not considered significant or that currently cannot be foreseen may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company s results of operations 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
industry risks 
the precision ball and roller industry is cyclical and tends to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production 
the company s sales could be negatively affected by adverse conditions in the industrial production sector of the economy or by adverse global or national economic conditions generally 
competition 
the precision ball and roller market is highly competitive  and many of the ball and roller manufacturers in the market are larger and have substantially greater resources than the company 
the company s competitors are continuously exploring and implementing improvements in technology and manufacturing processes in order to improve product quality  and the company s ability to remain competitive will depend  among other things  on whether it is able  in a cost effective manner  to keep apace with such quality improvements 
in addition  the company competes with many of its customers that  in addition to producing bearings  also internally produce balls and rollers for sale to third parties 
the company also faces a risk that its customers will decide to produce balls and rollers internally rather than outsourcing their needs to the company 
rapid growth 
the company has undergone rapid growth over the last several years 
accordingly  the company risks underutilization or inefficient utilization of its production facilities in future years 
the company also faces risks associated with start up expenses  inefficiencies  delays and increased depreciation costs associated with its new facility in mountain city  tennessee  and with its plant expansions 
raw material shortages 
because the balls and rollers manufactured by the company have highly specialized applications  their production requires the use of very particular types of steel 
due to quality constraints  the company obtains the vast majority of its steel from overseas suppliers 
steel shortages or transportation problems  particularly with respect to steel  could have a detrimental effect on the company s business 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
risks associated with international trade 
because the company obtains a majority of its raw materials from overseas suppliers and sells to a large number of international customers  the company faces risks associated with i adverse foreign currency fluctuations  ii changes in trade  monetary and fiscal policies  laws and regulations  and other activities of governments  agencies and similar organizations  iii the imposition of trade restrictions or prohibitions  iv the imposition of import or other charges or taxes  and v unstable governments or legal systems in countries in which the company s suppliers and customers are located 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations inflation and changes in prices 
currently  all foreign sales are billed and paid for in united states dollars 
an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies may adversely affect the ability of the company to compete with its foreign based competitors for international as well as domestic sales 
dependence on major customers 
during  the company s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of its net sales 
sales to various us and foreign divisions of skf  which is one of the largest bearing manufacturers in the world  accounted for approximately of net sales in  and sales to fag accounted for approximately of net sales in the company currently negotiates and contracts with various purchasing units within skf and believes that  in certain respects  such units operate independently with respect to purchasing decisions 
there can be no assurance  however  that skf will not centralize purchasing decisions in the future 
none of the company s other customers accounted for more than of its net sales in  but sales to three of its customers each represented more than of the company s net sales 
the loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to these customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business
