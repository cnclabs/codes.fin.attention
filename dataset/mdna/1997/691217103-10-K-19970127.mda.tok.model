item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a diversified manufacturer of products in narrowly defined niche markets and currently operates in two business segments  engineered component products and specialized equipment 
in the engineered component products segment  the company s products are sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers or service providers who use them in their end product or service 
products manufactured in this segment include electric motors  timers  heat transfer coils  replacement camshaft bearings  valve seats and shims 
the products sold in the specialized equipment segment are almost exclusively final products sold through independent dealers to their end users  typically horse owners  ranchers  farmers and municipalities 
products sold in the specialized equipment segment include aluminum trailers  grain handling equipment  front end loaders  hay bale handling and processing equipment  and all terrain commercial mowers 
the company s net sales for fiscal were million on which net sales of products manufactured by subsidiaries in the engineered component products segment accounted for of total net sales while net sales of specialized equipment accounted for of net sales 
among other financial data  the company measures the profitability of its subsidiaries by its business unit income  which is defined as a subsidiary s income from operations before allocation of corporate office expenses 
in fiscal  the company s consolidated business unit income was million  of which the engineered component products segment produced million  or of the total 
the specialized equipment segment had business unit income of million  or of the total 
the company s goal is to achieve long term growth in cash flow and net income  with the growth being divided more or less evenly over time between internal growth and growth through acquisition 
the company s internal growth objective is to maximize operating results by combining revenue growth with consistently high profit margins 
it seeks to accomplish this objective  in part  by competing on the basis of engineering and design expertise  production capabilities and customer service rather than primarily on price  and by controlling costs 
the company s individual subsidiaries businesses are managed on a day to day basis by their local management teams so that operating decisions can be made by managers close to the customer and the manufacturing operations 
annual plans are agreed upon by subsidiary management and the corporate office  and subsidiary managers compensation is tied to their unit s performance in comparison to those goals 
corporate management monitors progress towards these objectives and adds assistance where necessary to help subsidiaries meet them 
the corporate staff also coordinates the development and monitors the implementation of long term strategic plans 
certain administrative functions are handled by corporate staff so that business unit presidents can concentrate on operating objectives 
the corporate office also handles functions that are not value added to its customers  and where economies of scale can reduce costs  such as benefits  insurance and banking 
growth through acquisition is also important in achieving the company s growth objectives 
the company attempts to acquire businesses that operate in high margin  narrowly defined markets similar to those served by its existing businesses 
acquisitions may add new markets or enhance the market positions of existing businesses 
target acquisition candidates typically have high initial capital requirements and low ongoing capital needs  incorporate mature technologies in their products  have integrated manufacturing processes  compete on the basis of value added services  and have a management team with a proven record of accomplishment 
the company has focused its acquisition plans in its existing product segments and intends to continue to do so  with more of its efforts concentrated on its engineered component products segment 
during fiscal  the company made two small strategic acquisitions 
in august  the company acquired snyder industries  inc of seattle  washington through its dura bond bearing subsidiary 
snyder s operations will be consolidated into dura bond during the first quarter of fiscal snyder manufactures valve seats  valve seat inserts and valve seat booster shims used in remanufacturing automobile engines 
these products serve as an addition to dura bond s product line serving the engine remanufacturing industry 
dura bond paid million in cash and assumed million of snyder s debt  which was retired at closing 
in october   the company acquired koepke associates of northfield  illinois  a manufacturers representative firm  in exchange for  shares of common stock 
koepke associates has been renamed owosso motor group  inc and serves as the central sales organization for the company s stature electric  motor products owosso and motor products ohio subsidiaries 
the acquisition is intended to give these subsidiaries an enhanced and more focused presence among their large corporate accounts and prospects 
the acquisition history of the company s businesses is as follows year business acquired motor products owosso corporation snow coil  inc airmax  inc cramer company parker industries bristol company dura bond bearing company deweze manufacturing  inc sooner trailer manufacturing co 
great bend manufacturing  inc stature electric  inc snyder industries  inc owosso motor group  inc consolidated into snowmax  incorporated in consolidated into deweze in consolidated into cramer company in consolidated into dura bond bearing company upon acquisition

net income available to common shareholders for fiscal is calculated after deduction of  in preferred stock dividends and  in accretion of preferred stock value 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
in fiscal the company s net sales were million  an increase of over fiscal net sales of million 
the increase in net sales arose from the addition of the results of stature electric  acquired in october and the addition of a full year s results of great bend manufacturing  acquired in may these factors more than offset a decline in net sales at the company s other subsidiaries 
in the company s engineered component products segment  net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the effect of adding stature s net sales more than offset a decline of for the other subsidiaries in the segment 
most significantly  net sales at dura bond declined due to a significant reduction in sales to that subsidiary s largest customer  federal mogul corporation  which served as dura bond s largest distribution network 
federal mogul began to manufacture its own replacement camshaft bearings in the first quarter of fiscal in fiscal  dura bond s increased sales directly to end users rather than through federal mogul did not offset the loss of federal mogul sales 
sales of heat transfer coils declined in fiscal  primarily due to a reduction in sales of a coils to the air conditioning market 
the company has arranged to sell the rights to this product line to an employee who will begin to manufacture coils during fiscal the employee will lease space and equipment in one of snowmax s buildings and will pay a royalty fee on sales of these coils 
sales of a coils were million in fiscal because of more favorable market conditions and increased orders in its motor businesses  particularly for the motor products ohio subsidiary  the company expects that net sales in the engineered component products segment will be higher in fiscal than in fiscal net sales in the specialized equipment segment were million  an increase over fiscal net sales of million 
the inclusion of a full year of results of great bend manufacturing and a increase in sales of grain handling equipment at parker more than offset a decline of in net sales of sooner s aluminum trailers and lower net sales at deweze  which continued to be affected by low cattle prices 
the increase in sales of grain handling equipment was due to favorable pricing and production conditions for grain farmers in the central united states  an improved product line  and comparison to fiscal in which parker was out of production during its traditionally slow first quarter as the plant was expanded 
gross profit 
in fiscal the company s gross profit was million  or of net sales  below fiscal gross profit of million  or of net sales 
gross profit in the engineered component products segment was million  or of net sales in fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit in this segment was due to the addition of stature s results  offsetting reduced gross profit at the other subsidiaries in this segment 
this reduction was due to lower margins in the company s motor products operations  as a larger percentage of motors were lower margin wound field motors produced in motor products ohio plant 
lower sales at dura bond and snowmax decreased gross profit at those subsidiaries  and margins were reduced in the segment due to lower sales to cover fixed overhead expenses and the results of an inventory reduction program at snowmax 
the inventory reduction program led to an increase in cost of goods sold of  during the year  and the company does not expect to incur similar expenses in fiscal to a material extent 
gross profit in the specialized equipment segment was million  or of net sales in fiscal  representing a reduction of from gross profit of million  or of net sales  in fiscal the inclusion of great bend s results for a full year was more than offset by a significant reduction in margin and a decline in sales at sooner 
sooner s sales were reduced by slower demand in the second half of fiscal and production inefficiencies that led to slower shipments 
these production problems  caused in part by the disruptive effects of an ultimately unsuccessful union organization campaign and high employee turnover  combined with the decline in sales reduced the gross profit in that operation by million as compared to fiscal reduced margins at deweze due to a less favorable product mix were offset by higher gross profit at parker due to that subsidiary s significantly higher sales 
at the end of fiscal  the company recognized a reduction in inventory value of million in connection with its year end physical inventory count and valuation process 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  in fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales in fiscal in the company s engineered component products segment  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
these expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to including results of stature  including non cash amortization expenses relating to its purchase  and an increase to the reserve for bad debt expense at snowmax recognized in the fourth quarter 
the increase to selling  general and administrative expenses of reserves for and write offs of doubtful accounts at snowmax was million 
in the specialized equipment segment  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to including great bend s results for a full year  including non cash amortization expenses relating to its purchase 
these expenses also increased at parker due to the large increase in sales at that subsidiary and at sooner for personnel related expenses in anticipation of higher sales 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal corporate expenses increased primarily due to increases in personnel costs  including severance costs and recruitment expense related to the replacement of the company s former president and chief operating officer  increased computer programming and other information services expenses and increased legal and professional expenses 
despite the increase  these expenses remained consistent with the increase in the company s net sales 
the company expects that its continuing investment in upgraded information systems and additional personnel to help manage its growth will cause corporate expenses to increase somewhat in fiscal  though not materially disproportionately to its sales 
income from operations 
income from operations fell to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due to the lower gross profit and increased selling  general and administrative expenses and corporate expenses as discussed above 
among other measures  the company evaluates the operating performance of its business segments and its subsidiaries based on business unit income  which is defined as income from operations before allocation of corporate expenses 
the company believes this measurement most closely reflects the subsidiaries individual contributions 
on this basis  business unit income for the engineered component products segment decreased to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of sales  in fiscal due to the factors discussed above 
business unit income in the specialized equipment segment before corporate expenses was million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal due to the factors discussed above 
a table presenting business unit income by product line and segment for the past three fiscal years is presented above on page interest expense  net 
net interest expense increased to million  or of net sales in fiscal from million  or of net sales in fiscal the increase in net interest expense arose from increased average borrowing levels in fiscal due primarily to debt carried in connection with the acquisition of stature and a full year of interest on debt related to the acquisition of great bend 
net income 
net income in fiscal was million  or of net sales  after a tax provision at an effective rate of 
this compares to net income in fiscal of million  or of net sales  after a tax provision at an effective rate of 
the decrease is attributable to the lower income from operations  higher interest expense and higher effective tax rate 
the substantial increase in the company s effective tax rate results from the higher proportion of non deductible expenses  primarily non cash amortization expenses related to acquisitions  as compared to pretax income 
because of the pretax loss in the fourth quarter  the company recognized income tax expense at a substantially higher rate in that quarter to bring the full year rate to 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
the company expects a lower effective tax rate in fiscal due to relatively flat non deductible expenses and higher pretax income 
net loss available for common stockholders 
in fiscal  the company reported a loss of million available for common stockholders 
the loss is calculated by subtracting dividends on preferred stock of million and non cash accretion in value of preferred stock of million from net income 
this results in a net loss per common share of in fiscal as no preferred stock was outstanding until the end of fiscal  no such subtraction was necessary in that fiscal year 
the company expects to show improvement in income available to common shareholders from its current businesses for the full year in fiscal as compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales were million for fiscal  as compared to million for the prior year period  representing an increase of 
net sales of engineered component products decreased to million from million in fiscal a decrease in sales of fractional horsepower motors in the second half of the fiscal year due to a slower manufacturing economy and the loss of some sales at the higher volume end of that business  combined with a small decrease in heat transfer coil sales  more than offset increases at the other businesses in this segment 
in the specialized equipment segment  sales more than tripled to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was attributable to the purchase of sooner and great bend 
sales of grain handling equipment rose slightly despite a plant shutdown in the first quarter of fiscal during a construction project  while sales of bale handling and processing equipment declined in the face of a difficult agricultural economy in its region of the country 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of sales  an increase of over million  or of net sales  in fiscal the gross profit in the engineered component products segment was million  or of net sales  in fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales in fiscal the small decrease is attributable to the decrease in net sales 
in the specialized equipment segment the gross profit was million  or of net sales in fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in gross profit as well as the decrease in gross margin is due to including the results of sooner and great bend in fiscal  the gross margins at those subsidiaries is lower than the gross margin in the other specialized equipment subsidiaries 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales in fiscal as compared to million  or of sales in fiscal the increase resulted primarily from the addition of selling  general and administrative expenses of sooner and great bend  including non cash amortization expenses of approximately million relating to the acquisition of those businesses by the company 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the rest of the company s businesses in fiscal were approximately equal to the fiscal level 
selling  general and administrative expenses in the engineered component products segment increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal from million  or of sales  in fiscal due to non cash amortization expenses at its dura bond subsidiary created in connection with the reorganization of the company which took place at the end of fiscal the reorganization 
in the specialized equipment segment  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in the prior fiscal year due to including sooner s and great bend s expenses in fiscal corporate expenses 
corporate expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal corporate expenses rose in fiscal primarily due to increased legal and professional fees and other expenses resulting from the company s new status as a public company  increased insurance expense  higher personnel expenses commensurate with the company s growth  and increased lease expense for an upgraded corporate computer system 
income from operations 
income from operations increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal from million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase can be attributed to the acquisition of sooner and great bend  while the operating margin decreased because of non cash amortization expenses related to these acquisitions  and the other factors described above 
among other measures  the company evaluates the operating performance of its business segments and its subsidiaries based on business unit income which is defined as income from operations without the allocation of corporate expenses 
the company believes this measurement most closely reflects the subsidiaries individual contributions 
on this basis  business unit income for the engineered component products segment decreased to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal due to the factors discussed above 
business unit income in the specialized equipment segment was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal due to the factors discussed above 
a table presenting business unit income by product line and segment for the past three fiscal years is presented above on page interest expense  net 
net interest expense increased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase was due to higher debt outstanding during fiscal  primarily as a result of the acquisition of great bend  and the lack of interest income from affiliates due to the retirement of affiliate notes in connection with the reorganization 
net income 
the company s net income in fiscal was million  or of net sales  in fiscal after an income tax provision at an effective rate of 
this represents a increase compared to net income of million  or of net sales  in fiscal after a pro forma tax provision calculated at a rate of 
the decrease in net income as a percentage of sales is attributable to the decline in operating margin described above  as well as increased net interest expense and the higher effective tax rate 
reported net income of million for fiscal does not include a provision for income taxes because the company s businesses were subchapter s corporations in that year 
in addition  reported net income benefited from a change in accounting for income taxes that resulted in a million gain 
income before the provision for income taxes increased by from million to million 
the effective tax rate increased due to higher non deductible expenses  consisting primarily of non cash amortization expense related to acquisitions and the reorganization 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at october  from million at october  in addition to cash and cash equivalents at october   the company had million of cash that was restricted under industrial revenue financings 
net cash provided by operating activities rose to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase arose despite the substantial decrease in net income because of a million increase in non cash expenses resulting from the acquisitions of great bend and stature deducted before calculating net income in fiscal additionally  the company reduced its working capital needs in fiscal  particularly due to a million decrease in inventory  about half of which resulted from its inventory reduction program at snowmax 
during fiscal  the company s working capital needs accounted for a use of cash of approximately million 
these internally generated funds provided for capital expenditures  financing of acquisitions and dividends to common and preferred shareholders 
the company s primary cash requirements have been for operating expenses  including raw materials  labor costs and funding of accounts receivable  as well as capital expenditures  acquisitions and dividends to shareholders 
primary sources of cash have been from operations and bank borrowings  with industrial revenue bonds being used for specific capital projects 
working capital decreased to million at october  from million at october  primarily due to the decrease in inventory mentioned above 
this decrease more than offset the reduction in the current portion of notes payable to affiliates issued in connection with the purchase of stature which were paid for using the company s revolving credit facility 
the company maintains a million revolving credit agreement with two banks with a termination date of march  at october  borrowings of million were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement 
interest is payable  at the company s option  at either the agent bank s prime rate or at a spread over the london interbank offered rate that varies with the company s ratio of total debt to ebitda 
the libor spread was at october  the agreement contains customary financial and other covenants  including leverage  fixed charge  cash flow and net worth ratios  restrictions on certain asset sales  mergers and other significant transactions and a negative pledge on assets 
during fiscal  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements with its two banks with notional amounts totaling million 
the agreements call for the company to make quarterly fixed payments on the notional amount at rates of and for five years beginning in july in exchange for receiving payments at the three month london interbank offered rate 
during fiscal  and  the company invested million  million and million in capital expenditures  respectively 
in fiscal  million of capital expenditures related to the engineered component products segment  million related to the specialized equipment segment  and million related to the corporate office 
capital expenditures have grown due to the company s acquisitions and internal sales growth and have been used primarily for updating production equipment  providing tooling and equipment for the manufacture of new products  expanding the capacity of manufacturing facilities and reconfiguring production lines 
the company expects to continue to invest in significant levels of capital expenditures as it invests in the tooling and equipment necessary to produce its products efficiently and to respond to customer quality and production flexibility demands 
the company expects that capital expenditures for fiscal should remain at a level consistent with or somewhat higher than that of fiscal the company expects that capital expenditures will continue to be concentrated primarily in the engineered component products segment in fiscal during fiscal and fiscal  the company invested cash of million and million  respectively  for the acquisition of businesses  net of acquired cash 
in fiscal  the company also issued common stock as consideration for an acquisition and in fiscal  in addition to cash  the company also issued notes and preferred stock in consideration for acquired businesses 
in connection with the severance agreement with the company s former president and chief operating officer  the company paid  in cash and issued a subordinated note for  in payment for common shares he held  based on the market value of the shares at the time 
see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that funds from operations and borrowings from its bank facilities will be sufficient to fund its activities  including capital expenditures  for the foreseeable future 
seasonality sales of certain of the company s specialized equipment tend to be seasonal  with lowest sales during the first fiscal quarter and higher sales during the fourth fiscal quarter  corresponding with the fall harvest season for farmers 
sales of the company s engineered component products experience less seasonality but generally have higher sales during the second fiscal quarter while sales of these products are lowest during the first fiscal quarter 
cyclicality the company s engineered component products segment is subject to changes in the overall level of domestic economic activity 
the specialized equipment segment is subject to changes in certain sectors of the agricultural economy  which may be influenced by climate changes and governmental policy 
the segment s horse trailer sales  which have not tended to be affected by changes in the agricultural economy  have had a moderating effect on the results of the entire specialized equipment segment  but are subject to the overall domestic business cycle 
environmental matters the company is subject to environmental regulation with respect to its operations and is named as a potentially responsible party at two sites which are the subject of a government mandated clean up and which may require the company to incur additional expenses 
while it is not possible to quantify the potential financial impact of actions regarding environmental matters  the company believes that the outcome of this action is not likely to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
compliance by the company s customers with environmental laws may also require the company to incur additional capital expenditures 
for example  federal regulations mandated the cessation of the production by of chlorofluorocarbons  the main component of the most widely used coolant used in heat transfer coils 
although the heat transfer coils manufactured by the company are designed for use both with chlorofluorocarbons as well as with certain other coolants complying with the new requirements  if federal regulations were implemented which required the use of a coolant for which the company s heat transfer coils are not designed  the company may be required to incur additional capital expenditures to enable it to produce new heat transfer coils suitable for use with the new coolant 
the company is not aware of any such proposed or pending regulations 
inflation the company believes that the relatively moderate inflation over the last few years has not had a significant impact on the company s revenues or profitability 
cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the following information is provided pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of certain statements in management s discussion and analysis of this form k are forward looking statements made pursuant to these provisions 
the company cautions readers that the following important factors  among others  have in the past affected and could in the future affect the company s actual results of operations and cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company the company s results have been and can be expected to continue to be affected by the general economic conditions in the united states and specific economic factors influencing the manufacturing and agricultural sectors of the economy 
lower demand for the company s products can lower revenues as well as cause underutilization of the company s plants  leading to reduced gross margins 
commodity prices can have a material influence on the company s results 
grain prices and cattle prices can affect demand for certain agricultural equipment sold by the businesses in the company s specialized equipment segment 
metal prices  particularly aluminum  copper and steel  can affect the company s costs as well as demand for the company s products and the value of inventory held at the end of a reporting period 
lack of availability of certain commodities could also disrupt the company s production 
weather can affect the success of the grain harvest in the united states  which can directly affect demand for the company s grain handling equipment business 
the start up of the company s new ohio plant has affected results of operations 
manufacturing difficulties at this plant could lead to continuing losses from that operation 
changes in demand that change product mix may reduce operating margins by shifting demand toward less profitable products 
loss of a substantial customer may affect results of operations 
for example  the company s replacement camshaft bearing business sells a substantially reduced volume of its products through federal mogul corporation  which had been that business unit s largest customer 
the company s results can be affected by engineering difficulties in designing new products or applications for existing products to meet the requirements of its customers 
obsolescence or quality problems leading to returned goods in need of repair can also affect the value of the company s inventories and its profitability 
the company s results are dependent on the hiring and retention of qualified executive and local management 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to find qualified candidates in the future 
the company has a substantial amount of floating rate debt 
increases in short term interest rates could be expected to increase the company s interest expense 
acquisitions are an important part of the company s growth strategy 
acquisitions may have a dilutive effect on the company s earnings and could affect the company s available credit and interest costs 
conversely  the company may from time to time divest of product lines or business units 
any such divestiture may involve costs of disposition or losses on the disposition that could reduce the company s results 
the company is subject to various federal and state environmental laws which could be costly to adhere to if changed materially
