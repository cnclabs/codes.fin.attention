net interest income for increased as compared to  rising from million in to million in noninterest income increased from million in to million in while noninterest expense decreased from million in to million in return on average assets increased from in to in and return on average equity increased from in to in net interest income net interest income increased from to and was a major contributing factor to the corporation s increase in net income 
net interest income increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to the increase in average earning assets and the increase in loans as a percentage of total assets which allowed the corporation to increase its yield on average earning assets while its cost of interest bearing funds declined slightly 
the corporation s average earning assets increased from billion in to billion in average interest bearing liabilities also increased during the period  from billion in to billion in average interest bearing liabilities as a percentage of average earning assets remained fairly stable  going from in to in the taxable equivalent yield on average interest earning assets increased from in to in the cost of average interest bearing liabilities declined from to during the same period 
as a result of the thirteen basis point increase in yield on average earning assets and the seven basis point reduction in cost of interest bearing funds  the net interest margin increased from in to in the corporation was able to increase its yield on average earning assets through investing more of its assets in loans  its highest yielding asset 
loans accounted for of total assets as of december  compared to as of december  most of the loan growth came from consumer loans generated from the indirect consumer lending program  which began late in as of the end of  the corporation s indirect consumer loan portfolio exceeded million 
the corporation was also able to reduce the cost of interest bearing liabilities during the year 
this was achieved by implementation of strict adherence to deposit pricing standards  which enabled the corporation to reduce the cost of savings and now accounts by thirteen basis points while the cost of time deposits increased by only two basis points 
by more closely managing its borrowings  the company was also able to reduce its borrowing cost on federal home loan bank advances by thirty six basis points 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased from million in to million in average loans were significantly higher in increasing from billion in to billion in charge offs  net of recoveries  as a percentage of average loans outstanding declined from in to in as outstanding loans increased  but net charge offs increased by a proportionately less amount 
the allowance for loan losses increased significantly  rising from million at december  to million at december  the increase in the reserve is due to provision in excess of loan charge offs to increase the reserve proportionally to the increase in loans outstanding 
the corporation does not believe there are currently any trends  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the volume of its non performing loans 
noninterest income noninterest income increased from million in to million in service charges on deposit accounts was the largest component of noninterest income and increased from million in to million in as the corporation introduced new policies which reduced the amount of fees that were waived 
trust income increased from million in to million in as the trust assets managed increased during the year 
gains on sale of residential mortgage loans increased from thousand to million as increased loan demand enabled the company to sell larger volume of loans 
other noninterest income increased from million in to million in the largest component of other noninterest income was insurance commissions  which increased from million in to million in  mainly due to increases in loans 
loans accounted for of total assets at december  compared to of total assets at december  securities gains and losses were not a factor in the increase as the corporation incurred net securities gains of thousand in and thousand in noninterest expense noninterest expense decreased from million in to million in salaries and employee benefits increased from million in to million in as the number of full time equivalent employees increased due to acquisitions of new banks and opening of new branches 
occupancy expense increased marginally from million in to million in  and equipment costs remained level at million for both and data processing costs declined from million in to million in and stationery and printing costs decined from million in to million in taxes other than payroll  property and income  which consists mainly of kentucky franchise taxes on the equity of the affiliate banks  increased slightly from million in to million in fdic insurance declined from million to thousand as the fdic reduced premium rates to well capitalized institutions  of which all of the corporation s affiliates qualify 
other noninterest expense declined from million in to million in  consistent with the corporation s cost containment measures introduced late in compared to net income for was million compared to million for earnings per share for was per share compared to for net interest income rose from million in to million in the increase in net interest income was due to a higher level of average earning assets and rising interest rates during the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities both increased during as compared to the taxable equivalent yield on average interest earning assets increased from in to in the cost of average interest bearing liabilities increased from to during the same period 
as a result of this the net interest margin increased from in to in noninterest income increased from million in to million in service charges on deposit accounts  the largest component  increased from million in to million in during the same period  other noninterest income increased from million to million and trust income decreased from million to million 
net gains from the sale of residential mortgage loans decreased from thousand in to thousand in  due to the rising interest rates in effect during securities gains and losses were minimal in both periods  as the corporation incurred net securities losses of thousand in and net securities gains of thousand in noninterest expense increased from million in to million in except for two unusual items which decreased significantly  all other categories increased as would be expected in a period of acqusitions 
the increases in assets  employees and operational facilities from the acquisitions all contributed to across the board increases in noninterest expenses 
salaries and benefits increased from million in to million in  occupancy expense increased from million to million  data processing increased from million to million  stationery printing costs increased from million to million and other taxes increased from million to million while other noninterest expense items increased from million in to million in the two items which decreased significantly were losses associated with mortgage backed derivative securities and restructuring and reengineering costs 
mortgage backed derivatives had been purchased for certain trust accounts administered by the corporation s affiliates 
while these securities are guaranteed by either the federal home loan mortgage or the federal national mortgage association  and therefore  pose very little  if any credit risk  they exhibited an excessive volatility which led to a significant decline in their market value in which represented the difference between the book value carried in the customer accounts and the actual market value 
the corporation purchased the securities from the trust accounts during and because of the government guarantees  management expects to collect the full face value over time 
the securities are carried at market value as available for sale and currently no default on payments or additional market value declines have been suffered to date 
during the latter part of and continuing through  the corporation intensively examined ways to improve its performance through restructuring its operations and reengineering its work flow processes 
as a result of this  the corporation downsized its workforce by approximately of total employment 
severance and other related costs of downsizing in the amount of million were recognized in liquidity the corporation s objectives are to ensure that funds are available at the subsidiary banks to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability  and to ensure that funding is available for the parent company to meet the ongoing cash needs while maximizing profitability 
the corporation continues to identify ways to provide for liquidity on both a current and long term basis 
on a long term basis  the subsidiary banks rely mainly on core deposits  certificates of deposit of  or more  repayment of principal and interest on loans and securities  as well as federal funds sold and purchased 
the subsidiary banks also rely on the sale of securities under repurchase agreements  securities available for sale and federal home loan bank borrowings 
deposits increased marginally from billion at december  to billion at december  in order to compensate for the lack of funding from deposit growth  the corporation increased its borrowings of federal funds purchased and other short term borrowings from million as of december  to million at december  and also increased its federal home loan bank borrowings during the same period 
the bank is also preparing for a securitization of its automobile retail loan portfolio during the second quarter of to provide additional funding and liquidity 
the lack of deposit funding has not affected the corporation s ability to fund loans or service its debt obligations 
due to the nature of the markets served by the corporation s lending institutions  management believes that the majority of its certificates of deposit of  or more are no more volatile than its core deposits 
during the periods of low interest rates  these deposit balances remained stable as a percentage of total deposits 
in addition  arrangements have been made with two correspondent banks for the purchase of federal funds on an unsecured basis  up to an aggregate of million  if necessary  to meet the corporation s liquidity needs 
the corporation owns million of securities designated as available for sale and valued at market which are available to meet liquidity needs on a continuing basis 
the corporation also relies on federal home loan bank advances for both liquidity and management of its asset liability position 
often the corporation matches the maturity of these advances with pools of residential mortgage loans which are not sold in the secondary market  some of which have maturities of ten to fifteen years 
federal home loan bank advances increased from million at december  to million at december the corporation generally relies upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities  to provide cash for its investing activities 
as is typical of many financial institutions  significant financing activities include deposit gathering  use of short term borrowing facilities such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements  and the issuance of long term debt 
the corporation has a million credit line available which expires june   in the form of a revolving line of credit of which the entire line was available as of december  see long term debt footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
the corporation s primary investing activities include purchases of investment securities and loan originations 
in conjunction with maintaining a satisfactory level of liquidity  management monitors the degree of interest rate risk assumed on the balance sheet 
the corporation monitors its interest rate risk by the use of static and dynamic gap models at the one year interval 
the static gap model monitors the difference in interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities as a percentage of total assets that mature within the specified time frame 
the dynamic gap model goes further in that it assumes that interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be reinvested 
the corporation uses the sendero system to monitor its interest rate risk 
the corporation desires an interest sensitivity gap of not more than fifteen percent of total assets at the one year interval 
the corporation s static interest rate gap position as of december  is presented below interest rate sensitivity analysis december  total over in thousands months months year year total interest earning assets securities and deposits      loans      total earning assets      interest bearing liabilities now  money market and savings accounts     time deposits      federal funds purchased and other short term borrowings    advances from fhlb      long term debt     total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap for the period      cumulative      cumulative as a percent of earning assets the corporation now uses  on a limited basis  interest rate swaps as an additional tool in managing interest rate risk 
as of december   there was outstanding million in notional principal value of interest rate swaps 
interest rate swaps involve an exchange of cash flows based on the notional principal amount and agreed upon fixed and variable interest rates 
in this transaction  the corporation has agreed to pay a floating interest rate based on libor and receive a fixed interest rate in return 
the impact on operations of interest rate swaps was not significant during and is not expected to be significant during capital resources total shareholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december  the primary source of capital of the corporation is retained earnings 
cash dividends per share were per share for and per share for the corporation retained of its earnings for and for regulatory guidelines require bank holding companies  commercial banks  and thrifts to maintain certain minimum ratios and define companies as well capitalized that sufficiently exceed the minimum ratios 
the banking regulators may alter minimum capital requirements as a result of revising their internal policies and their ratings of individual institutions 
to be well capitalized banks and bank holding companies must maintiain a tier leverage ratio of no less than  a tier risk based ratio of no less than and a total risk based ratio of no less than 
the corporation s ratios as of december  were  and  respectively 
community trust bancorp  inc and all banking affiliates met the criteria for well capitalized at december  as of december   management is not aware of any current recommendations by banking regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material adverse impact on the corporation s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the corporation differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the corporation s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations
