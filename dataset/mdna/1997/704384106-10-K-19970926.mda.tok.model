the net proceeds were used to pay down debt owed by the company under its revolving credit facility with a bank syndicate revolving credit facility as a result of the gensar acquisition

the board of directors of the company has the authority to determine the principal rights  preferences and privileges of the authorized preferred stock 
paymentech has no current plans to issue such stock 
paymentech has no current plans to pay dividends on the common stock 
the company presently intends to retain earnings to support the growth of paymentech s business 
the payment of any future dividends will be determined by the company s board of directors  in light of conditions then existing  including paymentech s results of operations  financial condition  capital requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant at the time by the board of directors 
in addition  the payment of dividends may be subject to certain restrictions under paymentech s revolving credit facility 
prior to the first quarter of fiscal  it was the company s policy to dividend a portion of its net income to first usa 
subsequently  paymentech has not paid dividends 
paymentech s stockholders equity was million at june   compared with million at june  stockholders equity increased primarily as a result of the offering  the capital contribution from first usa and the results of operations 
income taxes paymentech s consolidated provision for income taxes includes state and federal income tax components 
paymentech s effective tax rate was  and for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate was the result of stock compensation expense and amortization of goodwill  purchased merchant portfolios and other intangibles  which are not deductible for tax purposes 
the tax rate for the periods prior to the second quarter of fiscal reflects litle as a subchapter s corporation  which included no federal income taxes in its financial statements because its income was taxed at the stockholder level

contingent liabilities through merchants and credit losses under the rules of visa and mastercard  paymentech has certain contingent liabilities for the transactions it processes on behalf of merchants 
if a cardholder purchases a product or service  and is dissatisfied after the purchase  the cardholder is able to return the product and demand a refund 
if the merchant  after having received payment from paymentech  refuses to pay the refund or properly provide the product or service  a chargeback results 
merchants must follow certain processing procedures in order to limit their exposure to chargebacks 
the payment processor must fund the chargeback if the merchant does not have sufficient funds to repay the chargeback 
paymentech conducts reviews of potential merchants based upon the perceived risk in the merchant s industry 
the contingent liability risk is greater for direct response merchants because the purchase is made before the product or service is delivered and the applicable card is not typically present 
paymentech takes these and other risks into account in making its credit determinations with respect to new merchants 
at june   paymentech had cash deposits from certain customers aggregating approximately million as an offset to potential contingent liabilities that are the responsibility of such customers 
these cash deposits are primarily related to merchants in the direct response industry 
credit losses incurred by paymentech with respect to its payment processing business were approximately million   and  for fiscal  and  respectively  compared with total sales volume processed in such periods of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
beginning in fiscal  credit losses include losses incurred as a result of third party authorization transactions 
paymentech s payment processing operations are not exposed to cardholder credit losses 
however  the company s commercial card operations incurred  in credit losses during fiscal parent company merger in june  paymentech s former indirect parent company  first usa  inc  merged with and into banc one resulting in banc one being the indirect owner of of paymentech s outstanding stock 
banc one has stated that it expects to reduce its ownership of paymentech  provided such reduction is accomplished in a way to preserve the pooling accounting treatment of the banc one first usa  inc merger 
the company understands that such treatment could be compromised if paymentech were to issue common stock  including in an acquisition or in a capital raising offering  in an aggregate amount which would cause banc one s ownership to fall below a controlling interest 
in addition  the company believes that growth in its third party authorization services and the number of acquisitions completed has slowed and been hampered by the reluctance of some banks to engage in business with a subsidiary of a large bank holding company 
banc one also owns a interest in an alliance with first data corporation  which alliance is a competitor of paymentech 
banc one refers all prospective merchant customers from banc one s branch network to such alliance 
furthermore  as a result of the banc one first usa  inc merger and banc one s strategy to allow paymentech to operate independently  the company now provides for itself certain administrative functions  including but not limited to human resources  legal staff and facilities administration  which functions were previously integrated with the same functions of the company s former parent  first usa  inc effective as of july   the company is providing these administrative services in a manner that is not integrated with banc one 
as a result  the company expects to incur additional overhead expenses 
recent announcement the company recently announced that it expects earnings per share for its first fiscal quarter ended september  to be below analysts consensus estimate 
the shortfall is primarily related to the following events 
paymentech has continued to find it difficult to grow its third party processing business or to make acquisitions in calendar according to paymentech s original plans 
secondly  planned cost savings have been slower than expected  delaying their financial contribution 
furthermore  the repricing of several key processing relationships impacted the quarter s results 
additionally  many merchants in paymentech s direct response business either lost sales or had sales delayed by the united parcel service strike 
consequently  paymentech has experienced a shortfall in revenue for this major line of business
