note payable on november   the company refinanced its bank line of credit with a new lending institution 
the new revolving line of credit is  secured by accounts receivable and inventory and all other assets except for equipment 
availability of borrowings under the line of credit is determined by calculations of the borrowing base  as specifically defined in the loan and security agreement  but generally means of qualifying accounts receivable and of eligible inventories less the aggregate amount of all outstanding commercial and standby letters of credit 
the line of credit bears interest at above the variable interest rate quoted by norwest bank of minnesota with a minimum rate of at february  and provides for a of unused line fee 
the credit line is for five years and is subject to renewal annually 
the line of credit includes certain financial covenants that the company must maintain to avoid a default including current ratio  debt to equity  maintaining a net worth of million and profitability 
at february   the balance under the line of credit was  which was the maximum available 
management believes that its current line of credit together with anticipated cash from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s current operations 
see cash flow sales of securities during fiscal  the company received additional equity funding through the sale of common stock from a regulation s and a regulation d offering  the exercise of underwriters warrants and the exercise of its class b common stock purchase warrants 
the company received net proceeds of  from the sale of an aggregate of  shares of common stock and  shares of series a preferred stock 
the proceeds were used to purchase equipment  for general corporate purposes and the reduction of bank debt 
the company is presently negotiating additional financing through the sale of equity or debt securities to pay for all or part of the planned increase in capacity at the dighton facility during the fiscal as well as to increase general working capital 
the company has no commitments for such financing  and no assurance can be given that additional financings will be successfully completed or that such financing will be available on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
equipment and lease financing from march through february  the company acquired through purchase or lease approximately million in additional equipment to increase manufacturing capacity and efficiency and to expand the company s product line 
this equipment was financed from the sale of equity securities and from equipment lease financing and bank loans 
the company currently has commitments to purchase  of additional equipment 
management intends to finance the purchase of the new equipment primarily through equipment lease financing 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to obtain new equipment financing through banks or equipment lessors 
disposition of taunton assets at february   plasco east partnership  a massachusetts general partnership of corporations plasco owed the company  for manufacturing equipment it sold or subleased to plasco 
a reserve of  was established in fiscal resulting in a non recurring charge for  and a net note receivable balance of  in april  the company  through an independent auctioneer  conducted an auction of the equipment originally sold to plasco and received proceeds of  an additional  was received in december from a third party guarantor 
the remaining loan balance  plus additional costs incurred during fiscal  were offset against the reserve resulting in an additional loss of  for fiscal  which is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
cash flow during fiscal  the company generated  from depreciation and amortization   from the return of lease deposits net  and  from the sale of common stock 
the company also raised  from an increase in accounts payable and  from a reduction in accounts receivable 
the company used  to purchase equipment and for plant improvements and  was used to make principal payments on capital lease obligations 
at february   stockholders equity was  as compared to  at february  the company s current ratio deteriorated from at february  to at february  the net book value of property and equipment decreased from  at february  to  at february  to date  the company has generated cash flows from income  including depreciation  financing activities  including sales of equity securities  lines of credit  term loan facilities  equipment leasing arrangements and loans from raw material suppliers 
the company is presently negotiating a to million debt and or equity financing to increase general working capital and provide funds for deposits on equipment 
management believes that upon the completion of the to million financing  fixed asset or lease financing will be available at competitive rates from banks and leasing companies to finance a substantial part of the planned million to million increase in capacity at the dighton facility during fiscal  and that its current revolving line of credit together with anticipated cash from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s current operations 
if the to million financing is not completed  management believes that the working capital ratio of at february  is too low for efficient operations 
the low working capital ratio has resulted in cash flow discontinuities in the first quarter of fiscal and the result has been that defaults have ocurred on some leases  and certain trade accounts payable are past due 
management believes that any lease defaults can be corrected upon the completion of the present financing 
the company has no commitments for such financing  and no assurance can be given that additional financings will be successfully completed or that such financing will be available or  if available  will be on terms favorable to the company 
exiting the traditional grocery t shirt sack product lines will result in cost reductions estimated to be million annually 
in the event that the present financing is not completed  the annual million savings combined with the company s anticipated growth of its proprietary bag and film products in fiscal will  in management s opinion  provide the necessary cash flows for the company to continue its operations but such cash flows will not be sufficient to support the company s fiscal business plan and meet its sales and profit objectives
