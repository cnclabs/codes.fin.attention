the company is also developing a standard crescendo product for medium and lower volume cardiac catheterization and cardiovascular centers that desire to collect a core set of outcomes measurements 
the vista platform is a windows based  flat file application  covering a product line of over database software modules that is primarily used in five medical specialties cardiac and thoracic surgery  cardiology  ophthalmology  urology and orthopaedics

a number of factors contributed to the company s performance in  including i customer demand for vista products in was adversely affected by a market trend away from flat file  pc based systems  toward client server  relational database architectures 
a decision was made in to address this trend on an interim basis  by developing an enhanced version of the vista product vista elite featuring additional reporting and decision support capabilities 
this development effort was discontinued in february  after a decision was made to accelerate  and focus on  the development of the company s crescendo client server  relational database platform and on line technologies 
while the company believes that the crescendo product line will address the emerging needs of the marketplace  the adoption of this technology involves product development and market risks that may cause results to differ materially from this belief 
ii during  sales of vista products were adversely affected by a decision to have the company s sales force focus primarily on management and support of indirect sales through the corporate marketing partners rather than direct sales activity

the company also implemented an inbound telesales initiative to support sales of vista products 
see sales and marketing corporate joint marketing 
iii the company s performance in was also affected by the introduction of crescendo products and cqs packages during the second half of although the company signed agreements for four crescendo products and cqs packages in  these agreements did not result in revenue due to unfulfilled obligations 
in addition  the crescendo products and cqs package will not significantly contribute to revenue until such time  if any  as these products and package are more widely accepted in the marketplace 
the contribution of the crescendo products and cqs package to revenue is also affected by a longer sales cycle for these products and packages due to the greater complexity and higher purchase prices associated with these sales 
several factors also contributed to an increase in operating expenses in including i the acquisition of clma in december  which was accounted for as a pooling of interest  involved acquisition related costs of  under pooling rules such costs are expensed 
see recent developments 
ii the acquisition during december of the equity interest in cordillera not owned by the company resulted in costs totaling million for purchase of in process research and development 
see recent developments below 
iii the dual development of the crescendo products and vista elite product resulted in greater research and development expense  including personnel  consulting and software sublicense costs associated with the vista elite development  totaling approximately million in the second half of iv in preparation for the transition to offering a more service intensive cqs package  the company hired additional implementation  consulting and support personnel in the second half of in advance of introducing the cqs package 
v the company also increased the number of the direct sales personnel in anticipation of product introduction 
vi the company incurred additional personnel and marketing costs in an attempt to expand into additional medical specialty markets eg urology  endoscopy and critical care to fulfill obligations entered into with certain of the company s joint marketing partners in the company anticipates that it will continue to experience operating losses during recent developments on december   the company acquired clma  pursuant to a merger in which clma became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and the company issued  shares of common stock in exchange for the outstanding stock of clma 
the merger is accounted for as a pooling of interests and is reflected retroactively in the financial statements of the company on that basis 
on december   the company entered into a reorganization agreement the reorganization agreement pursuant to which the company acquired the outstanding equity interest and all options to acquire equity interests in cordillera llc cordillera not held by the company 
the total purchase price of the acquisition was  consisting of cash  the value of options and warrants to purchase  shares of company common stock for a ten year period at per share  and acquisition related expenses  and was allocated to research and development in process  and developed technology 
purchased research and development in process was expensed as of december   the acquisition date  and developed technology will be amortized straight line over a three year period 
during  cordillera has been engaged in the development of a client server  relational database application and the on line system and www technologies to be employed in the company s registries 
in conjunction with the reorganization agreement  dr 
fortin joined the company as vice president and chief scientific officer and drs 
califf and phillips continued as consultants to the company 
in march   the company established a cost reduction program to reduce the workforce throughout the company  except at bsm and clma  and to close the operations of mis  its subsidiary near boston 
twenty nine positions were eliminated as a result  reducing the number of employees from at december  to at march  the company also has incurred severance expenses in the first quarter of related to executive officers of the company 
included in these charges are severance payments to former chief financial officer  donald haas 
restatement of previously issued financial statements the financial statements included in this annual report contain restatements of previously reported financial positions and results of operations for the years and and the nine months ended september  the restatements are based on an investigation by the company s management  auditors  and outside counsel of the company s accounting practices after concerns were brought to the attention of senior management and the company s board of directors by a new chief financial officer on february  the restatements primarily involve revenue recognition practices related to certain sales of software licenses and related services including revenue recognized based on purchase commitments made by certain corporate marketing partners but prior to actual shipment of products partner commitments  and revenue recognized in advance of actual shipment in other contexts preshipment recognition 
in addition  with respect to products first introduced in the second half of  revenue had been incorrectly recognized under cqs and crescendo contracts involving unfulfilled obligations  including commitments for future delivery of additional product features and performance of implementation and consulting services  and on a database development program based on negotiations with a prospective customer that were not finalized 
negotiations for this database development program were subsequently discontinued without an order 
consequently  the company s financial statements have been restated to recognize revenue in the appropriate periods and defer revenue recognition on certain contracts until the conditions for such recognition have been satisfied 
corresponding adjustments to expenses associated with revenues have been made to cost of sales and operating expenses primarily sales commissions in each affected period as appropriate 
these restatements had the net effect of reducing revenue for  and the nine months ended september  by   and  respectively

as to partner commitments  revenue will be recognized in the future at the time of shipment 
the amount and timing of shipments under these partner commitments depends  in part  on the market demand for vista products  which are currently the only products covered by these commitments  the effect on demand for vista products or the company s decision to focus its product development efforts on crescendo products  and the ability of the company to enter into satisfactory arrangements with its marketing partners regarding the scope of database products and services to be sold under these arrangements 
see sales and marketing
