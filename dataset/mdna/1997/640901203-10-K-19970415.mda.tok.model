dutton was elected to the board of directors in march state of hawaii contract status in june  the company began negotiating a significant amendment to its contract for a child support enforcement cse system with the state of hawaii the state when it determined that the total estimated cost to complete the system would be significantly greater than expected 
in march  the company received final state and federal government approval for this contract amendment totaling million 
as a result of numerous in depth reviews of this contract amendment  management determined that remaining contract costs would exceed the contract value by  and therefore  accrued this loss in december in june the company announced a new subcontract agreement with cbsi to expand cbsi s role in the hawaii cse contract 
cbsi at the request of hawaii  was contracted to lead a detailed review of the current system under development 
hawaii  in turn  agreed to pay cbsi million from the company s remaining contract budget when various milestones were achieved 
the company had a significant role in the detailed review and had hoped that its results would facilitate the resolution of open contractual scope issues 
on september   the state of hawaii terminated its contract with the company  effective september   claiming that the company had failed to fulfill its obligations under the contract 
in response  the company also terminated the contract with the state effective september  the hawaii contract  originally estimated to be a million contract  was increased to million by the state and the company in february  and was the company s largest contract at the time 
prior to termination  approximately million of costs had been incurred towards completion of the contract  and million had been billed and substantially paid 
on november  the state of hawaii filed a lawsuit in the circuit court of the first circuit of the state of hawaii against the company and aetna casualty and surety and federal insurance company for damages due to breach of contract the hawaii litigation 
aetna casualty and surety and federal insurance company provided the million performance bond on the company s contract with the state of hawaii to develop and install the state s child support enforcement system 
the suit alleges the company failed to meet contractual deadlines  provided late  incomplete and or unsuitable deliverables  materially breached the contract by never completing the design  the application programming  and the system test and systems implementation 
the state is seeking an unspecified amount for general damages  consequential and special damages  liquidated damages  attorneys fees  reimbursement for the cost of the suit and interest costs that the court deems just and proper 
the company vigorously denies the state s allegation and  on january  filed a counter claim against the state alleging that the state has breached the contract 
the company is seeking million in damages and is alleging that the state fraudulently induced the company into designing and building a system having capabilities and extraordinary features far beyond the scope of the company s contract and industry standards 
the fraudulent inducement in the form of withholding payments  improper rejection of work that satisfies the requirements of the contract and verbal and written abuse of the company s employees and management 
in addition  unisys  a company subcontractor under the company s hawaii contract  has submitted a  claim against the million performance bond 
in february all but million of the performance bond was released by the state of hawai  the remainder of which is intended to cover accounts payable to unisys and other subcontractors 
on december  cbsi filed a lawsuit in the superior court of the state of rhode island for  which the company had previously accrued  plus interest  costs and attorney s fees 
the company dispute is the  owned to cbsi and filed a counterclaim against cbsi on january  alleging  among other things  that cbsi failed to complete its duties required under the subcontract with the company in a timely manner  improperly engaged in negotiations with the state of hawaii to complete the project  hired and attempted to hire employees of the company in violation of its subcontract agreement with the company and obtained and utilized confidential information inappropriately 
also  the company alleges that cbsi owes the company  as of december  for which the company has not established a reserve for uncollectibility 
on february   the company filed a third party complaint tpc in the hawaii litigation  against maximus corporation maximus and cbsi 
maximus has been the state of hawaii s contract supervisor and advisor since the inception of the hawaii project 
the allegations the company has made against cbsi in this tpc are substantially similar to the allegations made against cbsi in the company s counterclaim to cbsi s december  lawsuit brought against the company in rhode island 
the company alleged  moreover  that maximus is liable to the company on grounds that i the company was an intended third party beneficiary under the contract between the maximus and hawaii  ii maximus tortiously interfered in the contract between the company and hawaii  iii maximus negligently breached duties to the company and iv maximus aided and abetted hawaii in hawaii s breach of contract 
the company s complaint seeks million in damages 
management believes that the company s claims against the state  maximus and cbsi have substantial merit and will vigorously pursue these claims 
there is substantial uncertainty  however  inherent in all litigation 
if the company were not to prevail in its suit with the state  such a result could have a material adverse effect on the company and jeopardize the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
management of the company and its attorneys are unable to predict with any certainty the ultimate outcome of this litigation  including the probability that this litigation will have a negative impact on the company or the dollar amount of the potential impact 
at december   the company had unbilled work in process and related receivables from the state and cbsi of approximately million  which exceeds stockholders equity of approximately million  for which no allowance for uncollectibility has been recorded 
the company has not accrued for any potential liability to the state which may result from this litigation 
in addition to the company has not accrued for any legal expense to be incurred in connection with this litigation  which could be significant 
due to the significant uncertainty created by these events  the company ceased recognition of revenue on the hawaii contract in an adjustment of million was recorded in the fourth quarter to reverse revenue of million  thousand and thousand previously in the first  second and third quarters  respectively 
in addition  costs incurred related to the hawaii contract of million in have been charged to expense 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the years indicated  information derived from the company s financial statements expressed as a percentage of the company s contract revenue earned year ended december  contract revenue earned cost of revenue earned gross profit selling and administrative expenses research and development expense restructuring income before income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract revenue earned decreased  or  from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december   primarily due to the completion of the maine famis and the west virginia cse oscar projects and the substantial completion of the idaho cse and the virgin islands cse vipers projects 
in  revenue recognized on the hawaii contract totaled million 
also  in  due to the developments with the hawaii contract discussed above and the uncertainties they created  the company ceased recognition of revenue on the hawaii contract and recorded an adjustment of million in the fourth quarter to reverse revenues of million  thousand and thousand previously recognized in the first  second and third quarters  respectively 
cost of revenue earned  consisting of direct employee labor  direct contract expense and subcontracting expense  decreased  or  from  in to  in due to the decreased effort to support the lower level of business and the lower reliance on subcontractor labor 
cost of revenue earned as a percentage of contract revenue earned increased from in to in due to approximately million of hawaii costs for which there were no corresponding revenues recognized 
gross profit decreased  or from  in to  in gross profit as a percentage of revenue earned decreased from in to in this is due to sales of hardware to virgin islands  hawaii and rhode island ricap projects which are at lower margins than profit earned on labor contracts and no corresponding revenue on hawaii costs of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from  in to  in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenue earned increased from in to in primarily due no hawaii revenue being recognized offset by the effect of the cost reductions implemented in early which were recorded as restructuring charges in restructuring charges decreased  or from  in to  in the company accrued  for payroll and related payroll taxes   for excess office space and miscellaneous charges in the credit in of  is the result of the company renegotiating the lease for its office space and being released from its commitment for unnecessary space 
as a result of the foregoing  loss before income taxes  decreased  or  from a loss of  for to a loss of  for loss before income taxes  as a percentage of contract revenue earned increased from in to in net loss decreased  from net loss of  in to a net loss of  in net loss as a percentage of contract revenue earned increased from in to in primarily due no revenue being recognized on the hawaii contract 
the company recorded income tax benefit for federal and state income taxes for and in the amount of  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate was for and for the company is not able to carry back losses for state income tax returns and has established a  reserve against future tax benefits which reduces the effective rate for year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract revenue earned decreased  or  from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december   despite the fact that the company performed substantially more work  and hence recognized more revenue  during under its contracts with the states of idaho  maine and the us virgin islands 
this increase in work performed and revenue recognized on these contracts was offset by significant increases in contract costs on the hawaii contract which the company determined were not recoverable through additional billings or contract amendments  resulting in significantly less revenue recognized on the hawaii contract in than cost of revenue earned increased  or  from  in to  in due to an increase in contract work performed and greater use of subcontractors at higher costs and the sales of approximately million of computer hardware to two of the company s customers included in contract revenue 
the cost of revenue also includes approximately  for the estimated gross loss to complete the hawaii contract 
cost of revenue earned as a percentage of contract revenue earned increased from in to in due to significant cost overruns on the hawaii contract and the sales of computer hardware which are generally at lower margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  from  in to  in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenue earned increased from in to in primarily due to the company s largely unsuccessful proposal efforts to win new contracts as well as the decrease in contract revenue earned as discussed above 
many of the company s highly talented and capable technical personnel  therefore  were neither generating nor earning contract revenue for an extended period of time 
restructuring charges of approximately  were expensed in the charge accrues  for payroll and related payroll taxes   for excess office space and changes include miscellaneous charges 
all of these costs are expected to be paid in except for  of rent expense  which will be paid in as a result of the foregoing  income loss before income taxes  decreased  or  from an income of  for the year ended december  to a loss of  for the year ended december  income loss before income taxes  as a percentage of contract revenue earned decreased from in to in net income decreased  from net income of  in to a net loss of  in net income loss as a percentage of contract revenue earned decreased from in to in primarily due to the additional costs incurred on the hawaii contract 
the company recorded income tax expense benefit for federal and state income taxes for and in the amount of  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate was for and for the company is not able to carry back losses for state income tax returns which reduces the effective rate when tax effecting the losses 
liquidity and capital resources in order to finance bid preparation costs and to obtain sufficient collateral to support performance bonds required by some state government agencies  the company has  in the past  entered into joint ventures with other firms with greater financial resources when bidding for contracts 
the company expects to continue and expand this practice prospectively as well as to pursue more time and material contracts than it has historically pursued 
time and materials contracts generally do not require performance bonds and almost always involve less risk to deliver what the customer requires 
the company has historically not received its first contract progress payments until approximately three to six months after contract award  which itself was as much as months after proposal preparation commences 
the company was therefore required to fund substantial costs well before the receipt of related income  including marketing and proposal costs and the cost of a performance bond 
prospectively  the company expects to tighten up this timetable  thereby reducing the requirement for additional working capital 
the company has funded its operations through cash flows from operations  bank borrowings  borrowings from venture partners  and private placements of equity securities 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was   and  in the years ended december    and respectively 
fluctuations in net cash provided by used in operating activities are primarily the result of changes in net income  contract and income tax receivable  accounts payable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on contracts due to differences in contract milestones and payment dates 
in december  the company s  revolving line of credit with citizens trust company expired and was replaced by a demand note 
in april a new  revolving line of credit was approved 
the company was required to reduce outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit to the following levels april   may   june   november   and december   the arrangement limited outstanding borrowings to the aggregate of of eligible accounts receivable plus of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on contracts 
amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit accrued interest at an annual rate of prime plus two percent on the first  and on the excess balance 
the difference between prime plus two percent and was deferred interest  due january  in addition  of the income tax refunds receivable at december  was to be used to pay down the line permanently and the remaining balance would be used to pay down the line but could be readvanced based on availability 
the prime rate was at december  the company s obligations under the facility were secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the agreement provided that the company may not pay any dividends on its capital stock without the consent of the bank 
in addition  the agreement required the company to meet certain financial covenants 
in may and june of  the company did not meet the pay down schedule in the revolving line of credit 
in september the company paid down the line by million using proceeds from an income tax refund 
also  a new  revolving line of credit was approved by the bank in september 
the company  under this agreement  was required to reduce outstanding borrowings to the following limits october   november   and december   in addition  of the income tax refunds at december  were to be used to pay down the line permanently 
the remaining terms of the agreement remained the same as the april agreement 
in the third quarter of and at the end of the year  the company violated various covenants requiring the company to maintain certain financial ratios and in december failed to make the required  pay down 
the revolving line of credit reverted to a demand note 
a new revolving line of credit agreement is under negotiation 
as of march  the outstanding balance is million 
although the company believes that cash flow generated by operations will be sufficient to fund continuing operations through the end of  this assumes that a mutually agreeable revolving line of credit can be negotiated and that there are no materially adverse decisions rendered in the ongoing litigation with hawaii 
see state of hawaii contract status 
there can be no assurance that the company will arrive at an agreement with the bank concerning payments 
if no agreement is reached with the bank  the company will continue to be in default 
the company is actively seeking new capital to be assured of its ability to continue as a going concern 
management intends to continue to vigorously defend the company in its litigation with the state of hawaii and maximus and cbsi 
concurrently  management intends to negotiate a fair and reasonable agreement with its bank 
management intends to continue its efforts to strengthen its balance sheet and  if either necessary or desirable  develop and implement a major recapitalization plan for the company 
management intends to aggressively seek new business 
the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations to date 
changes in accounting standards on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

the statement encourages  but does not require  a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans 
sfas no 
allows an entity to continue to measure compensation cost for those plans using the intrinsic value based method prescribed by apb opinion no 
for those entities electing to use the intrinsic value based method  sfas no 
requires pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share computed as if the fair value based method had been applied 
the company intends to continue to account for stock based compensation costs under apb opinion no 
and has provided the additional required disclosures relating to and stock options in its financial statements 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
this statement also requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of be reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
adoption of the statement had no impact on the company s financial statements
