item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion in this document contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements throughout this document as a result of a number of important factors 
for a discussion of important factors that could affect the company s results  please refer to the risk factors set forth below in factors affecting the company s business  in the financial line item discussions below and elsewhere in this document 
overview national instruments corporation engages in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of instrumentation software and specialty interface cards for general commercial  industrial and scientific applications 
the company offers hundreds of products used to create virtual instrumentation systems 
the company has identified two major markets for its products test and measurement and industrial automation 
the company s products may be used in either environment  and consequently  specific application of the company s products is determined by the end customer and often is not known to the company at the time of sale 
the company approaches both markets equally with essentially the same products which are used in a variety of applications from research and development to production testing and industrial control 
the company sells to a large number of customers in a wide variety of industries 
no single customer accounted for more than of the company s sales in  or the company s revenues have grown every year since and the company has been profitable in every year since there can be no assurance that the company s net sales will continue to grow or that the company will remain profitable in future periods 
as a result  the company believes historical results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income years ended december  net sales north america europe asia pacific consolidated net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest income interest expense foreign exchange loss gain  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net sales 
in  a continued increase in demand for the company s products generated a increase over in net sales which follows a increase from to this year marks the thirteenth consecutive year of annual sales growth exceeding 
the increase in sales in these periods is primarily attributable to the introduction of new and upgraded products in each period  increased market acceptance of the company s products  and an expanded customer base 
the relatively higher rate of growth in was primarily attributable to significant investments which the company made in its international sales and marketing operations during and including the opening of five asia pacific sales offices as well as increasing localized products for international markets 
north american revenue was million in  an increase of from  following a increase in over european revenue was million  an increase of over  following a increase in from asia pacific revenue grew to million  following an increase in over levels 
international sales sales to customers outside of north america accounted for  and of the company s consolidated net sales for  and  respectively 
the decline in european sales growth in early  experienced by many other technology companies during the past year  which resulted in a decrease in sales in the first quarter of is attributable primarily to the generally weak state of the european economy and to the delayed release of certain localized products 
european sales improved in the later half of with sales growth in the fourth quarter resulting in growth for the year ended december  the growth in the asia pacific region is driven by increased customer acceptance of localized products and support  particularly in japan  and the opening of direct sales offices in singapore  south korea and taiwan in late and in hong kong in early the company intends to continue to expand its international operations by increasing market presence in existing markets  completing the implementation of a japanese and centralized european information system  and continuing to use distributors to sell its products in countries in which the sales volume does not justify direct sales activities 
the company anticipates sales outside of north america to continue to represent a significant and possibly increasing portion of its revenues 
the company s international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the company s sales outside of north america are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the company is subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates 
in particular  increases in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies decrease the dollar value of foreign sales requiring the company either to increase its price in the local currency  which could render the company s product prices noncompetitive  or to suffer reduced revenues and gross margins as measured in us dollars 
these dynamics have adversely affected revenue growth in international markets in  and they could continue to do so 
the company has a hedging program which reduces the effect of exchange rate fluctuations but does not eliminate all of the company s foreign exchange risks 
see foreign exchange gain loss below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
sales made by the company s direct sales offices in europe and asia pacific are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the weighted average value of the us dollar 
this weighted average is calculated as the percentage change in the value of the currency relative to the dollar  multiplied by the proportion of international sales recorded in the particular currency 
between and this weighted average value of the us dollar increased by  causing an equivalent decrease in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency sales and expenses 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  the company s consolidated net sales for would have been million representing an increase of million or of consolidated net sales which represents consolidated sales growth 
if the weighted average value during and had been the same as that in  the comparable sales growth factors would have been growth in over and growth in over since most of the company s international operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies the change in exchange rates has a corresponding effect on operating expenses 
as of february   the weighted average value of the currencies in which the company operates a direct sales office versus the us dollar has increased by from december  the preceding proforma amounts and percentages are presented for comparison purposes and are not a reflection of actual results 
if the current trend in exchange rates continues throughout  it will have the effect of lowering the us dollar equivalent of international sales and operating expenses 
gross profit 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit represented  and in  and  respectively 
the relatively high software content of the company s products is demonstrated in the gross margins achieved by the company 
the relatively lower margin in is a result of the foreign exchange effect on sales during  as discussed above  and increased costs from the outsourcing of software duplication to a third party vendor during the first three quarters of there can be no assurance that the company will maintain the historical margin 
the marketplace for the company s products dictates that many of the company s products be shipped very quickly after an order is received 
as a result  the company is required to maintain significant inventories 
therefore  inventory obsolescence is a risk for the company due to frequent engineering changes  shifting customer demand  the emergence of new industry standards and rapid technological advances including the introduction by the company or its competitors of products embodying new technology 
while the company maintains valuation allowances for excess and obsolete inventory and management continues to monitor the adequacy of such valuation allowances  there can be no assurance that such valuation allowances will be sufficient 
the company believes its current manufacturing capacity is more than adequate to meet current needs 
in addition  the company completed centralization of its european inventory at a third party warehouse in amsterdam during and is already seeing improvements in its inventory management in the european region 
during  the company expects to transition its japanese operations to a new inventory management system in conjunction with the new information system being implemented 
there can be no assurance that the inventory management improvements will continue  that the company will not experience order processing or product shipment delays in connection with this transition  or that anticipated benefits will actually occur 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense in increased from  which followed an increase of in from the increase in these expenses in absolute amounts during and is primarily attributable to programs to increase the company s international presence in both the european and asia pacific markets and increases in sales and marketing personnel both internationally and in north america 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue declined to of revenue during  following a decline in to from in the company continues to benefit from reduced promotional costs as a result of converting to more electronic media such as the company s interactive cd rom application  instrupediatm  more cost effective demonstration disks and the use of the instrumentationweb  the company s world wide web server accessed through the internet 
the company expects sales and marketing expenses in future periods to increase in absolute dollars  and to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on initial marketing and advertising campaign costs associated with major new product releases  increasing product demonstration costs and the timing of domestic and international conferences and trade shows 
research and development 
research and development expense as reported in increased compared to when adjusted for the acquisition of georgetown systems  inc gsi and another software acquisition during  which is discussed below  research and development expense grew in  following a increase in over the increase in research and development expenditures excluding the gsi acquisition costs in in absolute amounts in each period was primarily due to the hiring of additional product development engineers 
the decline in research and development expense as a percentage of revenue is due to increased capitalization of software development costs as discussed below 
the company believes that a significant investment in research and development is required to remain competitive 
the company capitalizes software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
the company amortizes such costs over the related product s estimated economic life  generally three years  beginning when a product becomes available for general release 
amortization expense totaled million  million  and  during  and  respectively 
the increase in amortization expense is due primarily to amortization of development costs capitalized as a result of the gsi and imaging acquisition software purchases 
software development costs capitalized during such years were million   and million  respectively 
the significant items capitalized in include bridgeview  labview and purchased software development costs 
the levels of capitalization in prior years are primarily a result of completing significant upgrade projects for labview and labwindows cvi 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased from  which followed an increase of in from the increased spending in absolute dollars in was primarily due to the increased sales volume and the related supporting activities and also due to the costs of supporting the company s worldwide management information system in north america and europe 
the increased spending in absolute dollars from to was attributable to expenses incurred in north america relating to upgrading the company s management information systems  the costs associated with opening the new asia pacific sales offices  and the increased spending associated with the centralization of the company s european warehouse and administrative operations 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue declined to of revenue during this decline is attributable to the efficiencies in north america and europe achieved primarily as a result of the implementation of the new management information system 
the company expects that general and administrative expense in future periods will increase in absolute amounts and will fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
interest income and expense 
interest income in increased from  which followed an increase of in from due to the income from the investment of proceeds from the company s issuance of common stock under an initial public offering in march during  interest income continued to increase as a result of a full year of invested proceeds and also due to the investment of cash generated from operations 
interest expense decreased from  which followed an increase of in from interest expense represents less than one percent of net sales and fluctuates as a result of bank borrowings and interest terms thereon 
the large increase in interest expense from to is due to increased bank borrowings for the manufacturing facility completed in foreign exchange gain loss 
the company experienced net foreign exchange losses of  during  compared to gains of  and million in and  respectively 
these results are attributable to movements between the us dollar and the local currencies in countries in which the company s sales subsidiaries are located 
the company recognizes the local currency as the functional currency of its international subsidiaries 
the loss in is primarily attributable to the strengthening of the us dollar against the japanese yen and correlates to the gain when the yen appreciated dramatically against the dollar 
the company utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts against a majority of its intercompany and certain european third party foreign currency denominated receivables in order to reduce its exposure to significant foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s hedging activities only partially address its risks in foreign currency transactions  and there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
if the strengthening of the us dollar that occurred throughout continues in  the company will continue to experience significant foreign exchange losses due to the foreign exchange risks that are not addressed by the company s hedging strategy 
the company typically limits the duration of its foreign exchange contracts to days and does not currently hedge anticipated transactions 
the company does not currently invest in contracts for speculative purposes nor does it intend to do so in the foreseeable future 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s forward contracts and hedged positions 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for resulted from a change in the mix of income among taxing jurisdictions and utilization of tax credits for taxes paid in higher tax rate jurisdictions 
the decrease from to resulted from income tax benefits attributable to the company s foreign sales corporation  utilization of foreign net operating loss carryforwards and higher nontaxable interest income 
at december   five of the company s subsidiaries had available  for income tax purposes  foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  of which  expire between and the remaining  of loss carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income in the related tax jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources the company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
historically  the company also financed its capital expenditures  such as the new manufacturing facility constructed in  through borrowings from financial institutions 
at december   the company had working capital of approximately million compared to million at december  the increase in working capital is reflected in the increase of cash and cash equivalents of million from december  to december   because of cash flow generated from operating activities 
accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december   as a result of higher sales levels 
receivable days outstanding of days at december  represent an improvement over days outstanding at december  consolidated inventory balances have decreased to million at december  from million at december  inventory turns of per year represent an improvement over turns of per year at december  and indicate the company s improvements in inventory management occurring at the manufacturing facility in austin  texas as well as at the centralized european warehouse in amsterdam 
cash used for investing activities in includes million for the purchase of property and equipment  capitalization of software development costs of million  net short term investment purchases of million and acquisition costs of million for the purchases of gsi and the imaging acquisition software technology 
the company is currently in the process of designing and developing an office building to be located next to its manufacturing facility in austin  texas 
it is currently anticipated that a significant portion of the construction costs will be paid out of the company s existing working capital with the remaining costs being funded through credit from the company s current financial institutions 
the company estimates the total cost for the new building  including furniture  fixtures and equipment  will range from million to million with approximately million expected to be incurred during and the remainder in early the company has entered into firm commitments of approximately million for building design and site development costs 
the company is not committed to spend the remaining amounts and the actual level of spending may vary depending on a variety of factors including site development issues  progress of the company s third party contractors and availability of resources 
the company currently expects to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from a combination of available cash and short term investment balances  internally generated funds  and financing arrangements with its current financial institutions 
the company has a million credit agreement with nationsbank of texas  na which consists of i an million revolving line of credit  ii a million line of credit for new equipment purchases  iii a million loan to finance equipment purchased prior to  iv a million loan to finance the company s millenium office building located in austin  texas and v an million loan to finance the recently completed manufacturing facility 
as of december   the company had no outstanding balances under the revolving and new equipment lines of credit   million and million  under such other credit facilities  respectively 
subsequent to december  the company paid off the equipment loan and millenium loan which leaves only the manufacturing facility loan outstanding 
the revolving line of credit expires on june  and the equipment line of credit is available for draws until june  the company s credit agreements contain certain financial covenants and restrictions as to various matters  including the bank s prior approval of significant mergers and acquisitions 
borrowings under the line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s borrowing activity 
the company believes that the cash flow from operations  if any  existing cash balances and short term investments and credit available under the company s existing credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months depend on the company s profitability  its ability to manage working capital requirements and its rate of growth 
factors affecting the company s business fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including changes in the mix of products sold  the availability and pricing of components from third parties especially sole sources  the timing of orders  level of pricing of international sales  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the difficulty in maintaining margins  including the higher margins traditionally achieved in international sales  and changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or suppliers 
as has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future  new software products of the company or new operating systems of third parties on which the company s products are based  often contain bugs or errors that can result in reduced sales and or cause the company s support costs to increase  having a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
in addition  the company serves a number of industries such as semiconductors  telecommunications  aerospace  defense and automotive which are cyclical in nature 
downturns in these industries could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in recent years  the company s revenues have been characterized by seasonality  with revenues typically being relatively constant in the first  second and third quarters  growing in the fourth quarter and being relatively flat or declining from the fourth quarter of the year to the first quarter of the following year 
if this historical pattern continues  revenues for the first quarter of would not exceed revenues from the fourth quarter of the company s results of operations may be adversely affected by lower sales levels in europe which typically occur during the summer months 
the company believes the seasonality of its revenue results from the international mix of its revenue and the variability of the budgeting and purchasing cycles of its customers throughout each international region 
new product introductions and market acceptance 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs and frequent new product introductions  and is therefore highly dependent upon timely product innovation 
the company s success is dependent in part on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis to replace declining revenues from older products  and on increasing penetration in international markets 
in the past  the company has experienced significant delays between the announcement and the commercial availability of new products 
any significant delay in releasing new products could have a material adverse effect on the ultimate success of a product and other related products and could impede continued sales of predecessor products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to introduce new products on a timely basis  that new products will achieve market acceptance or that any such acceptance will be sustained for any significant period 
failure of new products to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to increase international market penetration will be successful 
operation in intensely competitive markets 
the markets in which the company operates are characterized by intense competition from numerous competitors  and the company expects to face further competition from new market entrants in the future 
a key competitor is hewlett packard company hp  which has been the leading supplier of traditional instrumentation solutions for decades 
although hp offers its own line of proprietary instrument controllers  hp also offers hardware and software add on products for third party desktop computers and workstations that provide solutions that directly compete with the company s virtual instrumentation products 
hp is aggressively advertising and marketing products that are competitive with the company s products 
because of hp s dominance in the instrumentation business  changes in its marketing strategy or product offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company believes its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside its control  including new product introductions by competitors  product pricing  quality and performance  success in developing new products  adequate manufacturing capacity and supply of components and materials  efficiency of manufacturing operations  effectiveness of sales and marketing resources and strategies  strategic relationships with other suppliers  timing of new product introductions by the company  protection of the company s products by effective use of intellectual property laws  general market and economic conditions  and government actions throughout the world 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
management information system limitations 
the company does not currently have an integrated worldwide management information system 
while the company is in the process of implementing a new worldwide system  the existing information resources have at times inhibited management s ability to manage certain aspects of the company s operations in a timely manner 
the company has completed implementation of the system for north america 
implementation for european operations began in october with the centralization of european warehousing which was completed in july the centralization of administrative functions in europe will continue until mid the company is in the early stages of implementation for its japanese operation which will be ongoing throughout all of the company s asia pacific operations are currently using independent management information systems 
until the new worldwide system can be implemented in this region  the growth of the company s japanese operations may be inhibited by the deficiencies of its current system 
the company is working to achieve a worldwide management information system that will allow for the consolidation of common functions to control costs and improve the ability to deliver its products in substantially all of its direct markets worldwide 
no assurance can be given that the company s efforts will be successful 
the failure to receive adequate  accurate and timely financial information could inhibit management s ability to make effective and timely decisions 
risks associated with international operations and foreign economies 
international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the european economies  particularly the french and german economies  are experiencing weak conditions 
in addition  recent indicators suggest a struggling japanese economy 
there can be no assurances that these economic conditions will improve or stabilize in and accordingly these factors may affect the company s direct sales offices located in these countries and negatively impact future consolidated sales and operating results 
dependence on key suppliers 
the company s manufacturing processes use large volumes of high quality components and subassemblies supplied by outside sources 
several of these components are available through sole or limited sources 
the company has in the past experienced delays and quality problems in connection with sole source components  and there can be no assurance that these problems will not recur in the future 
proprietary rights and intellectual property litigation 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary rights relative to the technologies used in its principal products 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may have in the past infringed or violated certain of the company s intellectual property rights 
as is typical in the industry  the company from time to time may be notified that it is infringing certain patent or intellectual property rights of others 
while no actions are currently pending by or against the company  there can be no assurance that litigation will not be initiated in the future which may cause significant litigation expense  liability and a diversion of management s attention which may have a material adverse affect on results of operations 
dependence on key management and technical personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of its key management  marketing  research and development and operational personnel including dr 
truchard  mr 
kodosky and other members of senior management and key technical personnel 
the company has no agreements providing for the employment of any of its key employees for any fixed term and the company s key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with the company at any time 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s key employees in the future could have a material adverse affect on operating results 
the company also believes its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled management  technical  marketing  research and development  product development and operational personnel with experience in managing large and rapidly changing companies as well as training  motivating and supervising the employees 
competition for key personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in retaining its existing key personnel or attracting and retaining additional key personnel 
risk of product liability claims 
the company s products are designed in part to provide information upon which the users may rely 
the company attempts to assure the quality and accuracy of the processes contained in its products  and to limit its product liability exposure through contractual limitations on liability  including disclaimers in its shrink wrap license agreements with end users 
if future products contain errors that produce incorrect results on which users rely  customer acceptance of the company s products could be adversely affected 
further  the company could be subject to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results or financial position 
although the company maintains liability insurance  there can be no assurance that such insurance or the contractual provisions used by the company to limit its liability will be sufficient
