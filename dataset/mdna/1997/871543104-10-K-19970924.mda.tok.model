item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
business outlook and risk factors certain trend analysis and other information contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consists of forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbor provisions of those sections 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors including the factors listed below 
fluctuations in operating results 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future due to several factors  including  without limitation  the volume and timing of orders from customers and shipments to customers  the cancelation or rescheduling of customer orders  changes in the product or customer mix of sales  the gain or loss of significant customers  the company s ability to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis  the timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors  customer delays in qualification of new products  increased competition and competitive pricing pressures  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s and its competitors products  the long sales cycles associated with the company s products  cyclical conditions in the telecommunications and semiconductor industries  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and other factors 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations regarding future net sales and in the short term are to a large extent fixed 
if the company is unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected future sales shortfall  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the company s operations entail a high level of fixed costs and require an adequate volume of production and sales to maintain reasonable gross profit margins 
accordingly  any significant decline in demand for the company s products or reduction in the company s average selling prices  or any material delay in customer orders would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company s future results depend in large part on growth in the markets for the company s products 
the growth in each of these markets may depend on  among other things  changes in general economic conditions  or conditions which relate specifically to the markets in which the company competes  changes in regulatory conditions  legislation  export rules or conditions  interest rates and fluctuations in the business cycle for any particular market segment 
uncertainty of timing of product sales 
a substantial portion of the company s quarterly net sales is often dependent upon shipment of orders received during that quarter  of which  a significant portion may be received during the last month or even the last few days of that quarter 
furthermore  most orders in backlog can be rescheduled or canceled without significant penalty 
as a result  the timing of the receipt and shipment of an order  and the magnitude of such order  may have a significant impact on the company s net sales and results of operations for a particular quarter 
in addition  the uncertainty in the timing and the receipt of orders  delays in product shipment and unanticipated rescheduling or cancelation of orders may cause quarterly operating results to vary significantly from the company s expectations 
customer concentration 
a relatively small number of customers has historically accounted for  and is expected to continue to account for  a significant portion of the company s net sales 
in fiscal  at t corporation at t  a telecom solutions customer  accounted for of the company s net sales 
in fiscal  sbc communications inc  another telecom solutions customer  accounted for of the company s net sales 
no other single customer accounted for or more of net sales in fiscal years  or the loss of one or more of the company s significant customers  or a significant reduction in sales to any such customer  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to receive large orders from significant customers 
also  in the past  some of the company s large customers have significantly reduced or delayed product purchases 
the company s sales to its largest customers have fluctuated in the past and the company believes such large customer sales will continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year in the future 
for example  the company s sales to at t increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and are expected to decrease significantly in fiscal new product development 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards and changes in end user requirements 
technological advancements could render the company s products obsolete and unmarketable 
the company s success will depend on its ability to respond to changing technologies and customer requirements and on its ability to develop and introduce  in a cost effective and timely basis  new and enhanced products 
delays in new product development or delays in production startup could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
such delays have happened in the past  and there can be no assurance that such delays will not recur or that the company will successfully respond to technological changes and develop and introduce new or enhanced products  or that such new or enhanced products will achieve market acceptance 
product performance and reliability 
the company s customers establish demanding specifications for product performance and reliability 
the company s products are complex and use state of the art components  processes and techniques 
there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements of existing products will not contain undetected errors  design flaws or other failures due to the complexities of such products 
undetected errors and design flaws have occurred in the past 
any such unforeseen problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
competition 
the telecommunications and semiconductor industries and the markets which they serve are highly competitive 
many of the company s competitors or potential competitors are more established than the company and have greater financial  manufacturing  technical and marketing resources 
in the telecommunications market  telecom solutions primary competitors are datum inc and hewlett packard company 
in addition  the enactment of the telecommunications act of  which permits rbocs  under certain conditions  to manufacture telecommunications equipment may result in competition from these customers of the company 
in the semiconductor market  linfinity competes with a number of large multinational companies and smaller niche companies 
the company s ability to compete successfully is dependent on its response to the entry of new competitors or the introduction of new products by the company s competitors  changing technology and customer requirements  timely development or acquisition of new or enhanced products  the timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors  continued improvement of existing products  cost effectiveness  quality  price  service and market acceptance of the company s products 
operating results may fluctuate as a result of unforeseen actions by competitors  the entry of new competitors and the introduction of new or enhanced competing products 
competition for many of the company s products continues to increase in existing markets and in the new markets in which the company has entered 
furthermore  the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  significant pricing pressures in these markets 
dependence on foundries  assembly and test services 
the company is utilizing imp  inc  an independent semiconductor foundry located in san jose  california  to supply most of its bicmos wafer requirements 
the company uses its own semiconductor fabrication facility to manufacture bipolar wafers 
reliance on outside foundries minimizes fixed costs and capital expenditures but increases certain operational risks  including the lack of an assured wafer supply and limited control over delivery schedules and manufacturing yields 
delayed wafer supply or reduced manufacturing yields may materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  any sudden demand for an increased amount of wafers or sudden reduction or elimination of wafers from the company s outside foundry  whether as a result of financial or operational difficulties at such foundry or otherwise  could result in a material delay in the shipment of the company s products and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
linfinity also relies on independent contract manufacturers in southeast asia to assemble and test a significant percentage of its integrated circuits and most of its electronic modules 
reliance on independent contractors can lengthen manufacturing cycle times  especially if the company is required  due to capacity constraints  to compete against others for these contractors services 
any inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity through existing or alternative sources at favorable prices  if and as required  could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the company s customer relationships and operating results 
proprietary technology 
the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to protect trade secrets  obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the rights of others 
the company relies on a combination of trademark  copyright and patent registration  contractual restrictions and internal security to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that such measures will provide meaningful protection for the company s trade secrets or other proprietary information 
the company has united states patents and patent applications pending covering certain technology used by its telecom solutions and linfinity operations 
however  while the company believes that its patents have value  the company relies primarily on innovation  technological expertise and marketing competence to maintain its competitive advantage 
the telecommunications and semiconductor industries are both characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
the company intends to continue its efforts to obtain patents  whenever possible  but there can be no assurance that patents will be issued or that any existing patents or patents that are obtained will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted will provide any commercial benefit to the company 
the company is also subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
from time to time the company has received claims from other parties asserting that their proprietary rights had been infringed  although the company is not a party to any intellectual property litigation 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future or that any such claims will not result in costly litigation or require the company to obtain a license for such intellectual property rights regardless of the merit of such claims 
no assurance can be given that any necessary licenses will be available or that  if available  such licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
environmental matters 
the company s operations are subject to numerous federal  state and local environmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing process 
while the company has not experienced any materially adverse effects on its operations from environmental regulations  there can be no assurance that changes in such regulations will not impose the need for additional capital equipment or other requirements or restrict the company s ability to expand its operations 
failure to comply with such regulations could result in suspension or cessation of the company s operations  or could subject the company to significant future liabilities 
governmental regulations 
federal and state regulatory agencies  including the federal communications commission and the various state public utility commissions and public service commissions  regulate most of the company s domestic telecommunications customers 
although the company is generally not directly affected by such legislation  the effects of such regulation on the company s customers may  in turn  adversely impact the company s business and operating results 
for instance  the sale of the company s products may be affected by the imposition upon certain of the company s customers of common carrier tariffs and the taxation of telecommunications services 
these regulations are continuously reviewed and subject to change by the various governmental agencies 
in addition  the recent enactment of the telecommunications act of allows rbocs  which are among the company s largest customers  to manufacture telecommunications equipment 
rbocs may  therefore  increasingly become competitors of the company in the markets it serves 
changes in current or future laws or regulations  in the united states or elsewhere  could materially and adversely affect the company s business 
risks associated with international sales 
the company s export sales  which were primarily to the far east  canada and western europe  accounted for  and of the company s net sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
export sales to the far east accounted for   and of net sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
international sales may be subject to certain risks  including but not limited to  foreign currency fluctuations  export restrictions  longer payment cycles and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or tariffs 
to date  sales and purchase obligations denominated in foreign currencies have not been significant 
however  if in the future  a higher portion of such sales and purchases are denominated in foreign currencies  gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of foreign currency accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in the company s business and operating results 
accordingly  the company does not currently engage in foreign currency hedging activities or derivative arrangements but may do so in the future to the extent that such obligations become more significant 
additionally  currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the demand for the company s products in foreign markets 
higher international sales also subject the company to increased risks associated with political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not materially and adversely affect the company s operations in the future or require the company to modify significantly its current business practices 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the company s proprietary technology to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
changes to effective tax rate 
the company s effective tax rate is affected by the percentage of qualified puerto rico earnings compared to total earnings as most of the company s puerto rico earnings are taxed under section of the us internal revenue code which exempts qualified puerto rico earnings from federal income taxes 
this exemption expires at the end of fiscal in addition  the benefit of the exemption is subject to certain wage based limitations 
this benefit will be further limited based on certain prior year puerto rico earnings during fiscal years through the company expects the fiscal effective tax rate to increase due to the anticipated increase in the percentage of total earnings that is expected to be earned in the us compared to fiscal fluctuations in stock price 
the company s stock price has been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility 
many factors  including any shortfall in sales or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
results of operations the company operates in two different industry segments 
telecom solutions  a division of the company  designs  manufactures and markets advanced network synchronization systems and intelligent access systems for the telecommunications industry 
linfinity microelectronics inc  a subsidiary of the company  designs  manufactures and markets linear and mixed signal integrated circuits  and modules for use in desktop power system  portable power system and data communications applications 
net sales net sales increased by million to million in fiscal and by million to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal sales was due to higher sales in both operations 
the increase in fiscal sales was due to higher telecom solutions sales offset by lower linfinity sales 
telecom solutions net sales increased by million to million in fiscal and by million to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was principally due to higher sales to at t corporation at t which increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company expects sales to at t to decrease significantly in fiscal the increase in fiscal resulted primarily from sales of new synchronization products and transmission products which offset the sales decline in mature synchronization products 
linfinity s net sales increased by million to million in fiscal and decreased by million to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to higher unit volume of new standard commercial products and a shift in sales to higher priced products 
the decrease in fiscal was essentially due to lower unit volume resulting from the general slowdown in the demand for integrated circuits used in personal computers in the last half of fiscal gross profit margin the company s gross profit margins were   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the higher gross profit margin was principally attributable to higher unit volume and increased manufacturing efficiencies at telecom solutions 
in fiscal  the lower gross profit margin was primarily due to reduced manufacturing efficiencies at both operations  a shift to lower margin products at telecom solutions and a decline in unit volume at linfinity 
future gross profit margins will largely depend on product mix  manufacturing efficiencies and selling prices 
operating expenses research and development expense increased to million or of net sales in fiscal from million or of net sales and million or of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to higher expenditures for the development of new wireless synchronization products at telecom solutions 
the increase in fiscal resulted principally from a higher level of investment in new product development by both operations  which more than offset lower earnings based incentive compensation in both operations 
during fiscal  telecoms new product development program was focused on wireline and wireless synchronization  network management software and transmission products 
during fiscal  linfinity s new product development program was focused on scsi terminators  switching regulators  blacklight inverters and low dropout regulators 
selling  general and administrative expense increased by to million or of net sales in fiscal from million or of net sales in fiscal  and decreased by in fiscal from million or of net sales in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to higher marketing and sales expenses associated with increased sales  expanded sales support and product promotion  and higher earnings based incentive compensation 
the decrease in fiscal was essentially attributable to lower earnings based incentive compensation at both operations  partially offset by increased telecom solutions marketing expenditures to support new wireless synchronization products and continued expansion in international markets 
operating income operating income increased by to million in fiscal and decreased by to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was attributable to higher operating income in both telecom solutions and linfinity 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in linfinity s operating income
