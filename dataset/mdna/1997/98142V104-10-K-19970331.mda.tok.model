overview general world airways is a leading global provider of long range passenger and cargo air transportation outsourcing services to major international airlines under fixed rate  multi year contracts 
the company s passenger and freight operations employ wide body aircraft which are currently operated under contracts  primarily with pacific rim airlines 
these contracts generally require the company to supply aircraft  crew  maintenance and insurance acmi or wet lease  while the company s customers are responsible for a large portion of the other operating expenses  including fuel 
world airways airline customers have determined that outsourcing a portion of their wide body passenger and cargo requirements can be less expensive  and offer greater operational and financial flexibility  than purchasing new aircraft and additional spare parts required for such aircraft 
world airways also leads a contractor teaming arrangement that is the largest single supplier of commercial airlift services to the united states air force s air mobility command us air force or usaf 
in july  world airways restructured its business to focus on the growing and profitable acmi contract services 
as such  the company ceased all scheduled passenger and scheduled charter services as of october   taking a one time charge of million see discontinuation of scheduled service operations 
the company generally charges customers on a block hour basis rather than a per seat or per pound basis 
block hours are defined as the elapsed time computed from the moment the aircraft first moves under its own power at the point of origin to the time it comes to rest at its final destination 
the company provides most services under two types of contracts wet lease contracts and full service contracts 
under wet lease contracts  the company provides the aircraft  cockpit crew  maintenance and insurance and the customer provides all other operating services and bears all other operating expenses  including fuel and fuel servicing  marketing costs associated with obtaining passengers and or cargo  airport passenger and cargo handling fees  landing fees  cabin crews  catering  ground handling and aircraft push back and de icing services 
under full service contracts  the company provides fuel  catering  ground handling  cabin crew and all related support services as well 
accordingly  the company generally charges a lower rate per block hour for wet lease contracts than full service contracts  although it does not necessarily earn a lower profit 
because of shifts in the mix between full service contracts and wet lease contracts  fluctuations in revenues are not necessarily indicative of volume trends or profitability 
it is important  therefore  to measure the company s business volume by block hours flown and to measure profitability by operating income per block hour 
as is common in the air transportation industry  the company has relatively high fixed aircraft costs 
while the company believes that the lease rates on its md aircraft are favorable relative to lease rates of other md operators  the company s md aircraft have higher lease costs although lower operating costs than its dc aircraft 
therefore  achieving high average daily utilization of its aircraft particularly its md aircraft at attractive yields are important factors to the company s financial results 
in addition to fixed aircraft costs  a portion of the company s labor costs are fixed due to monthly minimum guarantees to cockpit crewmembers and flight attendants 
customers historically  the company s business has relied heavily on its contracts with malaysian airline system berhad malaysian airlines  pt garuda indonesia garuda and the us air force 
these customers provided approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues and   and  respectively  of total block hours from continuing operations during for  these customers provided approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues and   and  respectively  of total block hours from continuing operations 
in  the company commenced operations for philippine airlines  inc philippine airlines providing four md aircraft under year round wet lease contracts 
these operations provided approximately and of the company s revenues and block hours from continuing operations  respectively  during the company expects that the agreement with philippine airlines will continue to have a substantial impact on its revenues and block hours in malaysian airlines 
world airways has provided wet lease services to malaysian airlines since  providing wet lease services for malaysian airlines scheduled passenger and cargo operations as well as transporting passengers for the annual hadj pilgrimage 
mhs  which owns of the company as of december   also owns of malaysian airlines 
in late  the company entered into a series of multi year contracts  with expiration dates ranging from to  to provide aircraft to malaysian airlines 
in  world airways provided three aircraft for hadj operations 
the company recently entered into a new month agreement for year round operations including the hadj with malaysian airlines whereby the company will provide two aircraft with cockpit crews  maintenance and insurance to malaysian airlines newly formed charter division through may the company is currently in preliminary discussions with malaysian airlines regarding a potential eleven month reduction in the utilization of one of these aircraft during the month term of the contract 
until recently  the company operated four passenger aircraft for malaysian airlines under the multi year agreements described above 
the contract for two of the four passenger aircraft for malaysian airlines expired in march while the company is deploying these two aircraft in the hadj  and will actively re market the aircraft thereafter  the company can provide no assurance that it will be able to redeploy the two aircraft  beginning june  at price and utilization levels at least as favorable as under the terms of the malaysian airlines contracts 
the company originally operated three md cargo aircraft for malaysian airlines 
however  beginning in july   and as mutually agreed by the parties  world airways redeployed two cargo aircraft  which had been operating under these contracts  into the philippine airlines contract 
the company and malaysian airlines are currently discussing the future redeployment of these aircraft back into malaysian airlines operations in order to meet the contracts original obligations 
the company can provide no assurances  however  that the company will  in fact  be able to redeploy these two aircraft back into malaysian airlines operation to meet the contracts original obligations 
revenues associated with these contractual obligations are included in the company s backlog amount included herein 
garuda 
the company has flown for garuda periodically since and yearly since since  the company has been one of the largest providers of passenger services to indonesia for the hadj pilgrimage 
the indonesian hadj pilgrimage is the world s largest due to the size of indonesia s islamic population 
in  approximately  indonesians traveled to jeddah for the hadj pilgrimage 
during the hadj pilgrimage  the company provided passenger service to garuda with seven aircraft  flying approximately  indonesians on company aircraft 
due to the company s capacity constraint during the period of hadj flying  the company reached an agreement with garuda to operate six aircraft during the pilgrimage 
philippine airlines 
in may  the company entered into a new acmi contract with philippine airlines  thereby further expanding its presence in the pacific rim 
the company presently operates four md passenger aircraft for philippine airlines under an agreement  with high minimum monthly utilization levels 
the company  however  has recently received a written communication from philippine airlines in which the airline contends that its leases for all four aircraft expire on november  the company believes that this position is contrary to the understanding of the parties that each of the md s are to be leased by philippine airlines for a period of months from delivery of each aircraft 
the parties are currently discussing the length of the lease term for these aircraft 
the company can provide no assurances  however  that philippine airlines will agree to lease any of the four md passenger aircraft beyond november   or that the company will be able to secure other business at as favorable price and utilization levels 
also  subsequent to year end  at philippine airlines request  the company agreed to a payment plan with respect to philippine airlines wet lease obligations for several months beginning in march although philippine airlines is current on this payment plan to date  if philippine airlines defaults on this payment plan  or fails to meet its monthly aircraft lease obligations  this development  if not offset by other business  would have a material adverse effect on the cash flows  financial condition and results of operation of world airways 
us air force 
the company has provided international air transportation to the us air force since the overall downsizing of the us military  combined with a need to respond quickly to the growing number of global regional conflicts places a premium on the mobility of the us armed forces 
this is reflected in the stable size over the past several years of the usaf s procurement of commercial airlift services 
although the company s agreements with the usaf provide for full service contracts with certain minimum performance requirements  the company has risks similar to an acmi agreement because the usaf agreements are cost plus contracts at attractive rates 
the usaf awards points to air carriers acting alone or through teaming arrangements in proportion to the number and type of aircraft such carriers make available to craf 
the company utilizes such teaming arrangements to maximize the value of potential awards 
the company leads a contractor teaming arrangement that enjoys a market share of the usaf s overall commercial airlift requirement 
during a period in which the us military downsized substantially  the company s portion of the fixed usaf award increased from million for the government s fiscal year  to million for the government s fiscal year 
the current annual contract commenced on october  and expires on september  these contracts provide for a fixed level of scheduled business from the us air force with opportunities for additional short term expansion business on and ad hoc basis as needs arise 
due to the utilization of a significant number of the company s aircraft under multi year contracts and other contractual commitments  it is unlikely that the company will be able to accept all of the available expansion business 
although overall defense department spending is being reduced  the level of the us air forces contract awards has remained relatively constant in recent years 
world airways  however  cannot determine how future cuts in military spending may affect future operations with the us air force 
although the company s customers bear the financial risk of filling the company s aircraft with passengers or cargo  the company can be affected adversely if its customers are unable to operate the company s aircraft profitably  or if one or more of the company s customers experience a material adverse change in their market demand  financial condition or results of operations 
under these circumstances  the company can be adversely affected by receiving delayed or partial payments or by receiving customer demands for rate and utilization reductions  flight cancellations  and or early termination of their agreements 
as a result of these and other contracts  the company had an overall contract backlog at december  of million  compared to million at december  approximately million of the backlog relates to operations 
the company s backlog for each contract is determined by multiplying the minimum number of block hours defined as the elapsed time computed from the moment the aircraft first moves under its own power at the point of origin to the time it comes to rest at its destination guaranteed under the applicable contract by the specified hourly rate under such contract 
approximately and of the backlog relates to its contracts with malaysian airlines and philippine airlines  respectively 
while the percentage of its block hour capacity that is currently under contract exceeds the comparable percentage in the past several years  the company still has substantial uncontracted capacity in the third and fourth quarters of in addition  a significant portion of the company s current contracts expire near the end of although there can be no assurance that it will be able to secure additional business to reduce this excess capacity  the company is actively seeking customers for and beyond 
the company s financial results and financial condition would be affected adversely if the company is unable to secure additional business to reduce this excess capacity 
the information regarding major customers and foreign revenue is contained in note major customers of the company s notes to financial statements in item competition the market for outsourcing air passenger and cargo acmi services is highly competitive 
certain of the passenger and cargo air carriers against which the company competes possess substantially greater financial resources and more extensive facilities and equipment than those which are now  or will in the foreseeable future become  available to the company 
the company believes that the most important bases for competition in the acmi outsourcing business are the age of the aircraft fleet  the passenger  payload and cubic capacities of the aircraft  and the price  flexibility  quality and reliability of the air transportation service provided 
competitors in the acmi outsourcing market include martinair holland  tower air and american transair and all cargo carriers  such as atlas air  gemini air cargo  polar air cargo and kitty hawk  and scheduled and non scheduled passenger carriers which have substantial belly capacity 
the ability of the company to achieve the growth anticipated by its strategic plan depends upon its success in convincing major international airlines that outsourcing some portion of their air passenger and cargo business remains more cost effective than undertaking passenger or cargo operations with their own incremental capacity and resources 
the allocation of military air transportation contracts by the usaf is based upon the number and type of aircraft a carrier  alone or through a teaming arrangement  makes available for use in times of national emergencies 
the formation of competing teaming arrangements comprised of larger partners than those sponsored by the company  an increase by other air carriers in their commitment of aircraft to the emergency program  or the withdrawal of the company s current partners  could adversely affect the size of the usaf contracts  if any  which are awarded to the company in future years 
cyclical nature of air carrier business the company operates in a challenging business environment 
the air transportation industry is highly sensitive to general economic conditions 
since a substantial portion of passenger airline travel both business and personal is discretionary  the industry tends to experience severe adverse financial results during general economic downturns and can be adversely affected by unexpected global political developments 
the financial results of air cargo carriers are also adversely affected by general economic downturns due to the reduced demand for air cargo transportation 
in and  the combination of a generally weak global economy and the depressed state of the air transportation industry adversely affected the company s operating performance 
although the company recently has experienced a growth in demand  such that block hours flown from continuing operations increased in by over  there can be no assurance that this level of growth will continue 
seasonality historically  the company s business has been significantly affected by seasonal factors 
during the first quarter  the company typically experiences lower levels of utilization and yields due to lower demand for passenger and cargo services relative to other times of the year 
the company experiences higher levels of utilization and yields in the second quarter  principally due to peak demand for commercial passenger services associated with the annual hadj pilgrimage 
in  the company s flight operations associated with the hadj pilgrimage will occur from march to may because the islamic calendar is a lunar based calendar  the hadj pilgrimage occurs approximately to days earlier each year relative to the western gregorian calendar 
as a result  revenues resulting from future hadj pilgrimage contracts will continue to shift from the second quarter to the first quarter over the next several years 
world airways believes that its contracts with malaysian airlines and the usaf should lessen the effect of these seasonal factors 
geographic concentration the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and block hours from its operations in the pacific rim region 
while the company believes the pacific rim region is a growth market for air transportation  any economic decline or any military or political disturbance in this area may interfere with the company s ability to provide service in this area and could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
utilization of aircraft due to the large capital costs of leasing and maintaining the company s aircraft  each of the company s aircraft must have high utilization at attractive rates in order for the company to operate profitably 
although the company s strategy is to enter into long term contracts with its customers  the terms of the company s existing customer contracts are substantially shorter than the terms of the company s lease obligations with respect to the aircraft 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into additional contracts with new or existing customers or that it will be able to obtain enough additional business to fully utilize each aircraft 
the company s financial results could be materially adversely affected even by relatively brief periods of low aircraft utilization and yields 
in order to maximize aircraft utilization  the company does not intend to acquire new aircraft unless such aircraft would be necessary to service existing needs or the company has obtained additional acmi contracts for the aircraft to service 
the company is seeking to obtain additional acmi contracts with new and existing customers  to which such new aircraft would be dedicated when placed in service  but the company can provide no assurance that it will obtain new acmi contracts or that existing acmi contracts will be renewed or extended 
maintenance engine maintenance accounts for most of the company s annual maintenance expenses 
typically  the hourly cost of engine maintenance increases as the aircraft ages 
the company outsources major airframe maintenance and power plant work to several suppliers 
the company has a year contract expiring in august with united technologies corporation s pratt whitney group for all off wing maintenance on the pw engines that power its md aircraft 
under this contract  the manufacturer agreed to provide such maintenance services at a cost not to exceed specified rates per hour during the term of the contract 
the company s maintenance costs associated with the md aircraft and pw engines have been significantly reduced due in part to manufacturer guarantees and warranties which began to expire in and which will fully expire by in addition  the specified rates per hour are subject to annual escalation  increasing substantially in accordingly  while the company believes the terms of this agreement have resulted in lower engine maintenance costs than it otherwise would incur  engine maintenance costs will increase substantially during the last five years of the agreement 
the company will begin to accrue these increased expenses in therefore  the company expects that maintenance expenses will continue to increase during the remainder of the term of the contract as the company s aircraft fleet ages 
operating losses while the company generated operating income each year from through and in  it sustained operating losses in and of million and million  respectively  and net losses of million in each of these two years 
for the year ended december   the company incurred a net loss of million  which resulted from operating losses incurred in the company s scheduled service operations  which were discontinued in  and the related estimated loss on disposal 
earnings from continuing operations were million for there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate operating income in or future years 
control by worldcorp  potential conflicts of interest as of december   worldcorp owned approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
worldcorp is a holding company that owns majority positions in two companies intelidata technologies corporation intelidata and the company 
worldcorp is highly leveraged and therefore requires substantial funds to cover debt service each year 
as a holding company  all of worldcorp s funds are generated through its subsidiaries  neither of which is expected to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result of worldcorp s cash requirements  it may be required to sell additional shares of the company s common stock from time to time  and such sales  or the threat of such sales  could have a material adverse affect on the market price on the company s common stock 
the company s ability to pay dividends is subject to certain restrictions contained within a worldcorp indenture see other matters dividend policy 
except as limited by contractual arrangements with mhs  worldcorp also is in a position to control the outcome of substantially all issues submitted to the company s stockholders  including the election of all of the company s board of directors  adoption of amendments to the company s certificate of incorporation  and approval of mergers 
under delaware law  worldcorp may approve certain actions by written consent without a meeting of the stockholders of the company 
in addition  the company s board of directors has eight members  one of whom  t 
coleman andrews  iii  is president  chief executive officer and a director of worldcorp 
the managements of worldcorp and world airways are currently exploring ways to maximize value for the shareholders of each company 
worldcorp is currently evaluating the feasibility of a disposition of its interest in world airways through a secondary offering or a sale to a third party 
there can be no assurances  however  that any such transactions will ultimately be consummated 
in addition  world airways recently announced its intention to purchase up to one million shares of its publicly traded common stock pursuant to open market transactions 
as of february   world airways has purchased  shares of its common stock pursuant to such purchases for an aggregate cost of million 
world airways does not intend to purchase any additional shares at this time 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total block hours increased  hours  or  to  hours in from  hours in  with an average of available aircraft per day in compared to in average daily utilization block hours flown per day per aircraft decreased to hours in from hours in in  the company continued to obtain a higher percentage of its revenues under wet lease contracts as opposed to full service contracts 
in  wet lease contracts accounted for of total block hours  consistent with in total operating revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in continuing operations block hours from continuing operations increased  hours  or  to  hours in from  hours in operating revenues 
revenues from flight operations increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in military flying and an increase in revenues generated from its hadj operations and services to certain international carriers  partially offset by a decrease in cargo operations resulting from a shift in the mix of business during operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased million  or  in the to million from million in flight operations expenses include all expenses related directly to the operation of the aircraft other than aircraft cost  fuel and maintenance 
also included are expenses related to flight dispatch and flight operations administration 
flight operations expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from an increase in block hours flown and higher crew costs and up front training expenses in connection with the integration of additional aircraft into the fleet 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in accrued profit sharing expenses 
in  the company accrued profit sharing expenses as a result of earnings experienced during that period 
no such accrual is necessary in as a result of losses from the discontinuation of scheduled service operations 
in addition  the company expects that its training costs will increase in as a result of crewmember attrition 
maintenance expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from the integration of additional aircraft into the fleet and a corresponding increase in block hours flown 
in addition  the company experienced an increase in costs associated with the md aircraft and related engines as a result of certain manufacturer guarantees and warranties which began to expire in and will fully expire by as discussed previously  the company expects its maintenance expense to increase in due to escalations in the specified rates per hour under the company s maintenance agreement 
aircraft costs increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the lease of two md er aircraft in the first quarter of and the lease of incremental dc aircraft which began in the second and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of  partially offset by the return of two dc aircraft to the lessor in the third quarter of fuel expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase is due primarily to an increase in fuel utilized in connection with its military operations and a slight increase in price per gallon 
promotions  sales and commissions increased million in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from commissions paid in connection with the new philippine airlines contract and an increase in teaming arrangement commissions associated with the larger fixed award contract received from the us air force beginning october depreciation and amortization increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from an increase in spare parts required to support the additional md aircraft and incremental dc aircraft described above 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional administrative personnel necessary to support the growth in the company s core business and an increase in certain legal and professional fees 
discontinued operations for its scheduled service operations  the company commenced service between tel aviv and new york in july and commenced service between the united states and south africa in june in addition  the company commenced scheduled charter operations between the united states and germany  switzerland  ireland  and the united kingdom in may the company  however  was unable to operate these scheduled service operations profitably 
in july  the company announced its decision to exit its scheduled service operations by october and focus its operations on its core business operating aircraft under contracts with international carriers  the us government  and international tour operators 
consistent with this decision  world airways ceased all scheduled operations as of october  as a result  the company s scheduled service operations were reflected as discontinued operations as of june   and prior period results have been restated to reflect scheduled service operations as discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations net of income tax effect approximated million for the year ended december  in addition  an estimated loss on disposal of million net of income tax effect which was recorded as of june   included the following million for estimated operating losses during the phase out period  a million estimated loss to be incurred in connection with sub leasing dc aircraft which will not be utilized in the company s operations subsequent to the phase out of scheduled service operations  a million writeoff of related leasehold improvements  and million for passenger reprotection expenses 
the company incurred approximately million of these costs during the six months ended december  and the company believes that its remaining accrual for estimated losses on disposal will be adequate to meet the remaining costs to be incurred during the phase out period 
in connection with the discontinuance of the company s scheduled service operations  the company is subject to claims by various third parties and may be subject to further claims in the future see other matters legal and administrative procedures 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total block hours increased  hours  or  to  hours in from  hours in  with an average of available aircraft per day in compared to in average daily utilization block hours flown per day per aircraft increased to hours in from hours in in  the company continued to obtain a higher percentage of its revenues under wet lease contracts as opposed to full service contracts

revenues from flight operations increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in revenues generated from the new multi year contracts with malaysian airlines 
average daily utilization for these contracts was hours in in addition  the company realized an increase in revenues associated with services to certain international carriers 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenues associated with the summer charter programs to europe 
revenues from flight operations subcontracted to other carriers increased million for to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from the company s need to subcontract certain flights to other carriers due to peak airlift requirements for the hadj pilgrimage 
this increase was partially offset by the subservice of certain contracts in the fourth quarter of primarily to make aircraft capacity available for the commencement of operations under the company s multi year contracts with malaysian airlines 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in flight operations expenses include all expenses related directly to the operation of the aircraft other than aircraft cost  fuel and maintenance 
also included are expenses related to flight dispatch and flight operations administration 
flight operations expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from the following an increase in block hours flown  higher cockpit crew levels associated with the integration of additional aircraft into the fleet in  and an increase in accruals under the company s profit sharing plans for its crewmembers during these factors were partially offset by a shift from full service to basic contracts 
maintenance expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from a non recurring reversal of million of excess reserves associated with the expiration of three dc aircraft leases and the increase in block hours flown in and lower costs associated with reduced maintenance requirements of new md aircraft and the guarantees and warranties received from the engine and aircraft manufacturers of the md aircraft and related engines  which guaranties and warranties began to expire in aircraft costs increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the lease of two additional md convertible aircraft in the first quarter of and the short term lease of incremental dc aircraft which began in the fourth quarter of and second quarter of  partially offset by the return of three lower cost dc aircraft to the lessor in the third quarter of fuel expenses decreased million in to million from million in this decrease is due primarily from a shift from full service to basic contracts in under which the company is not responsible for fuel  partially offset by an increase in fuel uplifted for military and scheduled service operations 
promotions  sales and commissions increased million in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from an increase in joint venture commissions associated with the larger fixed award contract received from the us air force beginning october depreciation and amortization increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from an increase in spare parts required to support the additional md aircraft and incremental dc aircraft described above as well as the amortization of certain md aircraft integration costs and other deferred costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in certain legal and professional fees  partially offset by the hiring of additional marketing personnel 
other income expense 
other expenses decreased million  or  in from primarily due to a million loss on the sale of a dc engine by the company in in addition  the company recognized a million gain in resulting from a settlement with the lessor relating to the return of two dc aircraft in liquidity and capital resources the company is highly leveraged 
the company incurred substantial debt and lease commitments during the past three years in connection with its acquisition of md aircraft and related spare parts 
at december   the company had total long term indebtedness of approximately million and notes payable and current maturities of long term obligations of million 
in addition  the company has significant future long term obligations under aircraft lease obligations relating to its aircraft 
the company has historically financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements out of cash flow from operating activities  public and private sales of its common stock  secured borrowings  and other financings from banks and other lenders 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could have important consequences to holders of common stock  including the following i the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be limited  ii the company s degree of leverage and related debt service obligations  as well as its obligations under operating leases for aircraft  may make it more vulnerable than some of its competitors in a prolonged economic downturn  and iii the company s financial position may restrict its ability to pursue new business opportunities and limit its flexibility in responding to changing business conditions 
the company s cash and cash equivalents at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
as is common in the airline industry  the company operates with a working capital deficit 
at december  the company s current assets were million and current liabilities were million 
the company believes that the combination of the financings consummated to date  income from continuing operations and the additional financings described below will be sufficient to allow the company to meet its cash requirements related to the remaining phase out of its discontinued operations and the operating and capital requirements for its continuing operations for the next twelve months 
in  the company instituted a program to purchase up to one million shares of its publicly traded common stock pursuant to open market transactions 
as of march   the company had purchased  shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million pursuant to such purchases 
the company does not intend to repurchase any additional shares at this time 
cash flows from operating activities operating activities used million in cash for the year ended december  compared to providing million of cash in the comparable period in this decrease in cash in resulted primarily from an increase in losses from discontinued operations and the loss on disposal of discontinued operations  an increase in accounts receivable  and a decrease in unearned revenue  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses  and other liabilities 
cash flows from investing activities investing activities used million in cash for the year ended december   compared to million in the comparable period in in  cash was used primarily for the purchase of rotable spare parts required for the integration of two md aircraft and incremental dc aircraft and leasehold improvements required on one of the dc aircraft obtained in late cash flows from financing activities financing activities used million in cash for the year ended december  compared to providing million in the comparable period in this decrease in cash resulted primarily from the purchase of shares of the company s common stock for an aggregate cost of million in  as compared to proceeds of million from the sale of common stock in capital commitments in october and january  the company signed a series of agreements to lease seven new md aircraft for initial lease terms of two to five years  renewable for up to years and in the case of one aircraft  for years by the company with increasing rent costs 
as of march  the company had taken delivery of all seven aircraft  consisting of four passenger md aircraft  one freighter md  and two passenger cargo convertible md s 
as part of the lease agreements  the company was assigned purchase options for four additional md aircraft 
in  the company made non refundable deposits of million toward the option aircraft 
in march  the company signed an agreement with the manufacturer to lease two md er aircraft 
under the agreement  the company leased each aircraft for a term of years with an option to return the aircraft after a seven year period with certain fixed termination fees 
as part of the agreement  the above mentioned deposits were applied towards the deposits required on these two aircraft 
in addition  the company agreed to assume an existing lease of two additional md freighter aircraft for years  beginning in  in the event that the existing lessee terminates its lease with the manufacturer at that time 
as of december   annual minimum payments required under the company s aircraft and lease obligations totaled million for as a result of the company s decision to discontinue scheduled service operations  the company reached an agreement with the lessor to terminate the leases of two dc aircraft effective december  as of march   world airways leases one short term dc aircraft and four long term dc aircraft with terms expiring in   and two in in august  the company amended its aircraft spare parts facility under the credit agreement to provide for a variable rate borrowing of million 
approximately million of this facility was used to pay off the previously outstanding balance of the spare parts loan facility and million was used to purchase additional spare parts for md s required during the remainder of the balance of this loan facility was used to increase cash balances which were drawn down during the first half of to purchase md spare parts 
in september  the company agreed to purchase a spare engine which was delivered in march the engine cost approximately million 
the company entered into an agreement with the engine s manufacturer to finance of the purchase price over a seven year term 
the company made payments of million and million towards this purchase in september and january  respectively

the company is contractually obligated to permit its southeast asian customers to deploy their own flight attendants 
while the arbitrator in this matter recently denied the union s request for back pay to affected flight attendants for flying relating to the hadj  the arbitrator concluded that the company s contract with its flight attendants requires the company to first actively seek profitable business opportunities that require using the company s flight attendants  before the company may accept wet lease business opportunities that use the flight attendants of the company s customers 
the company can provide no assurances as to how the imposition of this requirement will affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s aircraft dispatchers are represented by the transport workers union the twu

dividend policy the company has not declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on its common stock since the payment of a distribution to worldcorp in any future decision concerning the payment of dividends on the common stock will depend upon the results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans of the company  as well as such other factors as the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant

essop the board of directors of world airways adopted an employee savings and stock ownership plan the plan effective october  the plan is intended to allow participating employees to share in the growth and prosperity of the company  to encourage participants to save on a tax favored basis  and to provide participants an opportunity to accumulate capital for their future economic security 
the plan is an amendment and continuation of the worldcorp employee savings and stock ownership plan the worldcorp ksop 
as a result of various business developments  the vast majority of the participants in the worldcorp ksop were company employees 
for that reason  the company and worldcorp agreed that the company should assume worldcorp s obligation under the worldcorp ksop 
in connection with that action  the trustees exchanged the unallocated shares of worldcorp common stock held by the worldcorp ksop for a like value of shares in company common stock 
world airways also made a special contribution of  to the plan 
the plan will continue to hold the shares of worldcorp common stock that were allocated the participants accounts before october  no additional shares of worldcorp common stock will be allocated under the plan on or after that date 
instead  participants will have the opportunity to receive future allocations of company common stock 
income and other taxes in august  million shares of worldcorp common stock were sold by a group of existing shareholders 
this transaction constituted an ownership change of worldcorp and thus of the company as defined under section of the code the ownership change 
the ownership change subjected worldcorp to an annual limitation in and future years in the use of net operating losses nols that were available to worldcorp and thus allocable to the company on the date on which the ownership change occurred 
as of december   the company had nols for federal income tax purposes of million which  if not utilized to offset taxable income in future periods  will expire from to of this amount  million is subject to a million annual limitation resulting from the ownership change 
use of the company s net operating loss carryforwards in future years could be further limited if an ownership change were to occur in the future 
while the company believes that the sale of common stock in its initial public offering the offering did not cause an ownership change  the application of the code in this area is subject to interpretation by the internal revenue service 
also  any future transactions in the company s or worldcorp s stock could cause an ownership change 
in the event that more than approximately million of the outstanding convertible debentures of worldcorp are converted into worldcorp common stock  the company believes an ownership change will occur 
there can be no assurance that the operations of the company will generate taxable income in future years so as to allow the company to realize a tax benefit from its nols 
the nols are subject to examination by the irs and  thus  are subject to adjustment or disallowance resulting from any such irs examination 
in addition to the change in ownership that might occur upon the conversion of the worldcorp debentures  additional ownership changes of the company may occur in the future and may result in the imposition of a lower annual limitation on the company s nols existing at the time of any such ownership change 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s revenues during the past three years
