item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is engaged in the exploration  development and production of natural gas and oil  primarily in conjunction with the drilling programs it sponsors and manages 
the company derives its revenues from its own oil and gas production and turnkey drilling  well operations  gas gathering  transportation and gas marketing services performed under contract with the drilling programs 
since inception  the company has raised over  from the sale of partnership interests which has resulted in the formation of partnerships 
several factors may affect the amount of the company s revenues with respect to the activities of the drilling programs 
the amount of funds raised by each drilling program determines the number of wells for which the company receives drilling revenues 
the company continually monitors the cost incurred in drilling  completion and production operations and reviews its turnkey contract prices for each drilling program in order to reduce the risk of unprofitable drilling operations to the company and the economic considerations of the investors in the drilling programs 
the turnkey drilling contract price between the drilling programs and the company may vary among drilling programs depending on competition and other cost factors and the returns sought by investors in the drilling programs 
the company s capital availability  as well as revenue and profit considerations  may result in the company changing its interest percentage in future drilling programs 
the company s growth depends on a number of factors  including its continued ability to raise drilling program funds from non industry investors to increase the number of wells from which the company will receive production  contract drilling and service related revenues and the company s ability to maintain adequate liquidity to provide its contributions to new drilling programs and to acquire additional proved undeveloped or proved producing properties 
the company s growth is also dependent on several external factors  including the price at which gas  and to a lesser extent oil  can be found and sold 
the company s proved developed natural gas reserves decreased to bcf for fiscal from bcf for fiscal while proved developed oil reserves decreased to  barrels from  barrels  respectively 
the decrease in proved developed natural gas reserves was primarily due to reduced drilling and lower product prices received on march   the date utilized for the reserve evaluation 
the proved reserves developed and undeveloped decreased to bcf for fiscal from bcf for fiscal due primarily to the revision of proved undeveloped acreage that did not fit the development plan of the company 
proved oil reserves developed and undeveloped decreased to  barrels at march  from  barrels at march  due primarily to a downward revisions of  barrels and the production of  barrels for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the determination that certain proved undeveloped leasehold acreage no longer fits the company s development plans with the current economics and was either re categorized or released 
the company recognizes as proved undeveloped reserves the potential oil and gas which can reasonably be expected to be recovered from drillable locations which the company owned or had rights to at fiscal year end which are offsetting locations to wells that have indicated commercial production in the objective formation and which the company fully expects to drill in the very near future 
changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows are set forth in note of the company s financial statements 
the above mentioned additions and sales of natural gas  coupled with the development costs associated with undeveloped acreage  create timing differences which are reflected in the other category of the standardized measure 
of the company s total proved reserves  approximately are proved developed and approximately are proved undeveloped based upon equivalent unit mcfs 
proved undeveloped acreage requires considerable capital expenditures to develop 
management of the company believes that a significant percentage of the proved undeveloped reserves should be recovered in future years  although no assurance of such recovery can be given 
the following table is a review of the results of operations of the company for the fiscal years ended march   and all items in the table are calculated as a percentage of total revenues

comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues oil and gas production revenues increased  to  for fiscal compared to  for the prior corresponding period 
oil and gas production was relatively constant between years 
the increase in production revenues was primarily attributable to an average increase in gas prices of and an increase of oil prices of 
for fiscal the company received an average price of per barrel of oil and per mcf of natural gas compared to an average price of per barrel of oil and per mcf of natural gas received during fiscal drilling revenues for the period decreased by  for fiscal compared to fiscal due to the decrease in the number of wells recognized in revenue 
the company recognized revenues for fiscal on wells as compared to wells for fiscal the decrease in the number of wells recognized in drilling revenues was due to the decreaseof  in the amount of funds raised in the fiscal drilling programs of  as compared to  for the fiscal drilling programs 
management of the company believes that this reduction was caused by the uncertainties arising from the purchase of north coast common stock by lomak  now a principal stockholder of the company 
the company has wells in work in progress at year ended compared to at year ended revenues generated from well operating  transportation and other increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in unaffiliated third party gas sales 
the unaffiliated third party gas sales fluctuate from year to year based upon the availability of these types of transactions and company resources available 
the increase was also due to increases in well operating revenue and compression revenue from the company s five compressor stations 
expenses drilling costs for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased  due to the decreased number of wells completed between comparable periods 
the gross profit margin was for both fiscal periods presented 
net drilling income decreased approximately  between fiscal year ends due to the fewer number of wells drilled and completed 
oil and gas operations expense increased  for fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the increase in gas purchases related to unaffiliated third party gas sales as discussed above 
general and administrative expenses decreased  for fiscal compared with fiscal despite incurring  in expenses associated with the litigation with lomak and the company s offer to convert its preferred stock 
the lomak litigation was settled on november  this decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to costs savings derived from reduced salaries and employee benefits when the company reduced the size of its staff 
also  the staff reductions resulted in certain changes in job responsibility resulting in additional general and administrative costs being allocated to production expense and oil and gas operations 
depreciation  depletion  amortization  impairment and other decreased  for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the implementation of the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of during fiscal which resulted in an impairment of  for fiscal without a corresponding impairment for also  the adoption of sfas resulted in a decreased basis of existing properties being depleted for future periods 
interest expense increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal this increase was primarily due to the company s additional borrowings on its reducing revolving credit facility 
at march    was outstanding under the company s credit facility  as compared to  at march  operating income for the fiscal year ended increased  to  compared to an operating loss of  for the fiscal year ended net income increased  for fiscal to  as compared to a net loss of  for fiscal these increases in operating income and net income are primarily due to the decrease in general and administrative expenses  depreciation  depletion  amortization  impairment and other as well as increases in oil and gas production and well operating  transportation and other 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues oil and gas production revenues remained relatively constant between fiscal and fiscal production revenues were effected by relatively low gas prices during the company s first three quarters  although  gas prices increased substantially during the company s fourth quarter due to the generally colder weather conditions  resulting in increased demand 
production was also adversely affected by the continued rework on the company s gulf coast properties  but increased oil production and gas production from the company s acquisition and drilling of appalachian wells offset the gulf coast production decline 
for fiscal  the company received an average price of per barrel of oil and per mcf of natural gas compared to an average price of per barrel of oil and per mcf of natural gas received during fiscal drilling revenues decreased by  for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the decrease in the amount of funds raised from drilling programs as well as the timing of the formation of the drilling program  the commencement and completion of drilling activities and the number of wells recognized in revenue and the type of wells drilled 
drilling revenues were recognized on wells for fiscal compared to wells for fiscal at march   the company had additional wells as yet not recognized in revenues as compared to wells at march  the company s shallow wells range in depth from  feet to  feet  for which the company generally charges a lower turnkey drilling contract price compared to deeper gas wells ranging from feet to feet 
during fiscal the company formed two drilling programs and raised investor funds of  as compared to three drilling programs with investor funds of  during fiscal the first drilling program of fiscal was formed forty five days later than the first drilling program of fiscal  thereby delaying the number of wells completed and the recognition of revenue for the fiscal year 
well operating  transportation and other revenues for fiscal decreased  compared to fiscal primarily due to a  decline in unaffiliated third party gas sales 
the company reduced the number of low margin third party gas transactions in favor of focusing its gas marketing department on its proprietary gas sales during the period of low natural gas prices 
although the company actively pursues these sales  the amount of third party gas sales may vary materially from year to year 
revenue from administrative  management and agency fees  which are based on a percentage of the total investor capital raised in all of the drilling programs  increased by  for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to the formation of the drilling programs in fiscal coupled with the ongoing administrative fees accrued from the fiscal drilling programs 
expenses oil and gas production expenses increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to costs associated with reworking two wells in the gulf coast area and costs associated with the production enhancement program on the wells the company acquired in december the company was successful in reworking one gulf coast area well while the results of the second well will not be known until the first or second quarter of fiscal drilling costs for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased  due to the decrease in the number of wells completed between comparable periods 
however  the profit margin on drilling revenues increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in the drilling profit margin is due to lower drilling costs associated with the average depth of the company s upper devonian and clinton medina wells and improved cost controls for wells currently recognized in revenue compared to the prior period 
the company s upper devonian and clinton medina wells averaged  feet in depth for fiscal compared to an average of  feet in depth for fiscal the company also reduced its interest in the fiscal drilling programs to  as compared to in the fiscal drilling programs  and increased the turnkey drilling price the company receives thereby effecting the company s profit margin 
oil and gas operations expense decreased  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in unaffiliated third party gas purchases related to third party gas sales as discussed above 
depreciation  depletion  amortization  impairment and other increased  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the company s implementation of the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company routinely reviews its long lived assets for impairment  although sfas no 
required a different grouping of assets which caused an impairment for the period 
at march  the company s impairment of oil and gas properties and leases due to the accounting change was  the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires the cumulative effect of the accounting change to be reported in net income in the year of adoption 
abandonment of oil and gas properties decreased  in fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  the company abandoned a deep zone in two wells associated with its drilling on acreage acquired in the purchase of wells in western pennsylvania 
the company  in conjunction with its drilling programs  at march  has completed one of the wells in a shallower formation and anticipates the completion of the second well in the first fiscal quarter of interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was associated with the company s additional borrowings on its reducing revolving credit facility  the placement of a private debt financing with nagit usa  a former shareholder of the company  and an increase in the prime interest rate 
at march    was outstanding under the company s credit facility  as compared to  at march  net operating loss of  for fiscal compares to net operating income of  for fiscal the increase in the operating loss was due primarily to the increase in depreciation  depletion  amortization  impairment and other which resulted from the accounting change promulgated by the financial accounting standard board causing an impairment of oil and gas properties and leases of  without the affect of the impairment of oil and gas properties the company s fiscal net operating loss would have been a net operating income of  net income of  for fiscal decreased during fiscal to a net loss of  due primarily to the impairment of the company s oil and gas properties and leases coupled with the lower net drilling income recognized and high interest expense 
inflation and changes in prices while the costs of operations have been and will continue to be affected by inflation  oil and gas prices have fluctuated during recent years and generally have not followed the same pattern as inflation 
with today s global economy  especially in the area of oil and natural gas  management believes that other forces of the economy and world events  such as opec  the weather  economic factors  and the effects of supply of natural gas in the united states and regionally have a more immediate effect on current pricing than inflation 
the company received an average price of and per barrel for fiscal and  respectively  and and per mcf for natural gas for fiscal and  respectively 
the general market for natural gas in the appalachian basin has remained weak for a longer period than the company previously anticipated  however  gas prices have increased approximately in the company s last quarter of fiscal due to the colder appalachian area weather 
the reasons for the continued weak natural gas prices and recent increases in the gas prices can be attributed to supply and demand fluctuations caused by the weather sensitive nature of the industry 
although it is anticipated that there will be a decline in gas prices during the summer months compared to the winter of the demand for gas by storage facilities may continue to keep gas prices above last year s low prices 
other variables potentially effecting gas prices are increased competition from canadian gas  effects of gas storage and possibly federal energy regulatory commission ferc order the ferc order may have contributed to the lower spot market prices by mandating an unbundling of pipeline service and allowing open access to a variety of geographical markets 
management cannot predict what long term effects ferc order will have on either spot market prices or longer term gas contracts 
currently  the company sells natural gas under both fixed price contracts and on the spot market 
the spot market price the company receives for gas production is related to several variables  including the weather and the effects of gas storage 
the company anticipates that spot market prices will continue to fluctuate in response to various factors  primarily weather and market conditions 
in an effort to position itself to take advantage of future increases in demand for natural gas  the company continues to construct new pipeline systems in the appalachian basin and to contract with other pipeline systems in the region to transport natural gas production from company wells 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital was  at march  compared to negative  at march  the increase of  in working capital from march  reflects the company s increase in cash flow from operating activities  the reduced cash outflow for the purchase of tangible equipment and additional borrowings during the fiscal year 
the company was able to utilize equipment on previously uneconomic wells by abandoning those wells and installing the equipment on new productive wells to meet its obligations to the partnerships formed in fiscal as of march   the company had  outstanding under its credit facility 
north coast s current ratio was to at march  and 
to at march  the following table summarizes the company s financial position at march  and amounts in thousands amount amount working capital property and equipment   other total   long term debt   deferred income taxes stockholders equity   total   capital resources and requirements the oil and gas exploration and development activities of north coast historically have been financed through the drilling programs  through internally generated funds  and from bank financing 
the following table summarizes the company s statements of cash flows for the years ended march   and amounts in thousands dollars dollars dollars net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used for investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities   increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  all items in the previous table are calculated as a percentage of total cash sources 
total cash sources include the following items  if positive cash flow from operations before working capital changes  changes in working capital  net cash provided by investing activities and net cash provided by financing activities  plus any decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
as the above table indicates  the company s cash flow provided by operating activities increased approximately  for fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase is due to increased oil and gas production  well operating  and compression revenues coupled with reduced general and administrative expenses 
net cash used for investing activities decreased from  of cash sources for fiscal to  of cash sources for fiscal the decrease of  was due to the amount of funds raised in drilling programs and the subsequent number of wells drilled  coupled with the company s ability to utilize equipment on previously uneconomic wells by abandoning those wells and installing the equipment on new productive wells to meet its obligations to the fiscal drilling programs 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by  from fiscal to fiscal this decrease reflects the company s reduced need for borrowing due to the reduction in employee staff and the elimination of its preferred stock dividends 
the company has a  revolving credit agreement with its lender 
the agreement provides for a borrowing base which is determined semiannually by the lender based upon the company s financial position  oil and gas reserves  as well as outstanding letters of credit  at march   as defined 
at march   the company s borrowing base was  subject to monthly reductions of  beginning in may available borrowings under the facility at march  were  any may subsequently change based upon the semiannual reserve study and borrowing base determination see note to the company s march  financial statements 
also  the amendment of december  provides that the payment of dividends with respect to the capital stock of the company is prohibited 
as of march   the company had  outstanding under the credit facility 
at march  the company was in violation of its debt coverage ratio  although  this violation was waived by the lender 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at the lending bank s prime rate plus 
the revolving line of credit can be renewed annually or converted to a term loan at the company s option prior to its expiration in fiscal also  at march   the company had approximately  outstanding under a mortgage note payable 
the mortgage note bears interest at the rate of and requires the company to make monthly payments of approximately  through july the company purchased a building for its headquarters and entered into a mortgage note on may  for  over year term with an interest rate of to be renegotiated every five years 
the amount outstanding under the mortgage note at march  was  the amounts borrowed under its reducing revolving line of credit are secured by the company s receivables  inventory  equipment and a first mortgage on certain of the company s interests in oil and gas wells and reserves 
the mortgage notes are secured by certain land and buildings 
in addition to bank financing  the company has two loans with lomak 
the first loan of   outstanding on march  bears an interest rate at the prime rate designated by the chemical bank  na  plus at march  
the amounts outstanding under the terms of the company s financing arrangement are subordinated to the prior payment and amounts outstanding under the company s credit facility 
repayment of the loan is in cash  based upon a percentage of the net monthly revenues received from certain previously acquired properties 
the second loan in the amount of  is unsecured and may be repaid in cash plus accrued interest with approval of the company s senior lender with the proceeds of a sale of equity or may be converted into shares of common stock at the rate of per share 
the loan is subordinate to the company s credit facility with its senior lender and bears interest at the rate of per annum 
as of march   the balance of the loan and accrued interest was  in connection with entering into the loan agreement  the company issued a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
the warrants may be redeemed by the company for 
per share at its option upon days written notice 
on or about september  lomak  a publicly traded oil and gas company  purchased approximately of the voting stock of the company as of june  lomak owns of the voting stock of the company from two of the company s largest stockholders  nagit  usa nagit and bruce e 
brocker 
at the company s annual meeting of stockholders  lomak presented proxies representing the shares acquired from these shareholders and indicated its intention to nominate and elect two directors in the class whose terms were scheduled to expire at that meeting 
due to concerns about the validity of such proxies  the annual meeting was adjourned to a later date 
litigation among the company  lomak and mr 
brocker then ensued until november when the parties reached a settlement with respect to that litigation 
revenues derived from the company s drilling programs provide an important source of the company s cash flow 
due to uncertainties among potential drilling program investors arising out of lomak s acquisition of a substantial ownership interest in the company and the other matters described above  the company s ability to market its drilling programs has been adversely affected 
with the reduction of the drilling program activity and the need to conserve cash  the company s ability to utilize equipment it owns on non productive wells and increase profitably through the drilling programs was adversely affected 
demands on the company s capital resources have increased due to reduced cash flow associated with lower levels of investor interest in its drilling programs and increased costs associated with litigation and evaluating the company s strategic alternatives 
this has necessitated actions by the company to alter its growth oriented business plan in order to conserve cash 
on october   the company initiated layoffs of of its staff coupled with a temporary reduction or deferment in wages to many of its remaining employees 
also  the company suspended its dividends on its series a non cumulative and series b cumulative preferred stock in an effort to conserve cash resources 
the company subsequently made an offer to all holders of the company s preferred stock offering additional shares of the company s common stock as an enticement for conversion of the preferred stock to common stock 
management of the company believes that the funds anticipated to be raised in the drilling programs together with anticipated general economic conditions and various sources of available capital  including current available borrowings under the credit facility  will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and meet debt service requirements through fiscal in the event that available borrowings under the credit facility are not sufficient or additional financing cannot be obtained  the company would be required to continue its current efforts to conserve cash resources 
in order to accomplish this objective  the company believes that it would be necessary to take various actions  including reducing the amount of capital raised in future drilling programs  the introduction of additional cost cutting measures and the possible sale of certain assets 
management of the company believes that measures of this type would have a material adverse effect on the company 
accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation which permits either recording the estimation value of stock based compensation over the applicable vesting period or disclosing the unrecorded cost and the related effect on earnings per share in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has adopted the disclosure only provision of sfas no 
accordingly  no compensation costs have been recognized for stock based compensation see footnote of the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 earnings per share which will revise the calculation methods and disclosures regarding earnings per share 
sfas no 
is required to be adopted for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december   the company has not determined the impact  if any  of this standard
