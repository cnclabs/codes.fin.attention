in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company made a strategic decision to focus on the cbr business and to divest the tools business

as part of the spin off  the company entered into an agreement with brightware to provide certain services to the new entity including operational and systems support  facilities and administrative support and certain technical and customer support administrative agreement 
this agreement expired on january  the amount received for these services was  fiscal overview for the year ended january   the company did not meet its planned operating results  and had a reduced growth rate in product revenues  both in north america and internationally 
the company attributes this decrease in growth in product revenues to several factors  including a channel conflicts in the company s sales distribution attempting to implement a partnering and reseller strategy within a direct territorial sales model  b lower productivity by the sales organization in most geographic areas  c impact on the sales organizations from the resignations of the company s senior vice presidents of north american operations and international operations in the second quarter  and d the increased competitive environment in which the company operates 
the company has attempted to respond to these issues with certain marketing initiatives and adjustments to the product distribution model

years ended january   january  and january  revenues the company s revenues are derived principally from two sources i fees for licenses of the company s software products and technology and ii fees for consulting services  maintenance technical support and upgrades of software products and training 
product revenues result principally from non cancelable license agreements that provide customers the non exclusive right to use the products for a fixed term or on a perpetual basis 
such revenues are recognized upon i execution of a binding agreement  ii shipment of the product to the customer  iii when the license fee is fixed or determinable  and iv when collectability is reasonably assured

international revenues amounted to   and  for fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues for such periods  respectively 
the percentage increase in fiscal from fiscal was the result of the spin off of the tools business 
the company currently has subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany  france and the netherlands  offering licenses and consulting services  and has relationships with over distributors worldwide  serving europe  the middle east and africa  and asia and the pacific rim 
international revenues  however  are subject to various risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  repatriation of earnings  exchange rate fluctuations  and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have an adverse effect on the revenues from the company s future international sales and  consequently  the company s results of operations 
product revenues product revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and in fiscal from  in fiscal product revenues represented   and of total revenues for fiscal years   and  respectively 
product revenues have principally been derived from direct licenses of the company s software products to end users

substantially all of the growth in product revenues was due to higher unit sales volumes  the prices of the company s products have remained relatively constant 
north american product revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and increased in fiscal from  in fiscal international product revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and increased in fiscal from  in fiscal international product revenues represented   and of total product revenues for fiscal  and  respectively

however  in the second half of fiscal  the company experienced a sharp decline in the growth rate of cbr product sales 
the company attributed this decline to several factors  including a channel conflicts in the company s sales distribution attempting to implement a partnering and reseller strategy within a direct territorial sales model  b lower productivity by the sales organization in most geographic areas  c impact on the sales organizations from the resignations of the company s senior vice presidents of north american operations and international operations in the second quarter  and d the increased competitive environment in which the company operates

during fiscal   and  one customer accounted for   and of international service revenues  respectively 
this customer terminated its contract with the company in mid fiscal in addition to the termination of this major customer s contract  the decrease in fiscal revenues was also the result of a transition in the international consulting business  away from the tools business which was spun off in may to a consulting business based on the company s cbr product line 
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues  consisting primarily of the costs of product media and duplication  manuals  packaging materials  personnel related costs  shipping expenses and royalties paid to third party vendors  decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and increased in fiscal from  in fiscal the gross margin on product revenues was   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
the improved product gross margins in fiscal and  was the result of increased product revenues  thereby increasing the gross margin  and from a significant decrease in royalties paid to third parties 
the decreased royalties principally resulted from the lack of tools product sales in fiscal cost of service revenues cost of service revenues  consisting principally of personnel related costs for consulting  training and technical support  increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and decreased in fiscal from  in fiscal the gross margin on service revenues was   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
the improved gross margins in fiscal and was primarily the result of the increased utilization of consultants and the increased renewal rate of maintenance on cbr products 
product development product development expense consists primarily of employee related costs  including salaries  benefits  equipment and facility costs  incurred in the research  design  development and enhancement of the company s products 
product development expenditures  including capitalized software costs  increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and decreased in fiscal from  in fiscal capitalized software development costs amounted to   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
product development expense as a percentage of total revenues was   and for fiscal   and  respectively 
the significant increase in fiscal was the result of the investment in the cbr content navigator product release and the establishment of the kpd development group 
the percentage and dollar amount decrease in product development expense in fiscal was the result of the spin off of the tools business in may the company believes that continued commitment to product development will be required for the company s cbr products to obtain a competitive advantage 
accordingly  the company intends to allocate increasing resources to product research and development  but such expenses may continue to vary as a percentage of total revenues 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits and commissions of sales and marketing personnel  trade shows and promotional expenses  and non chargeable customer field service and sales support

general and administrative expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to increased staffing and associated expenses necessary to manage and support the company s planned growth  both domestically and internationally  additionally  the company received funds which were accounted for as an offset to general and administrative expenses during fiscal from the administrative agreement with the tools business  as previously discussed 
even with the benefit of the administrative agreement  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal this increase was attributable to the relocation of the company s corporate headquarters to northern california  as well as increased headcount due to the company s increased infrastructure requirements 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues was   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
non recurring during fiscal  the company invested in the development of a new business concept unrelated to its current businesses or product groups  managed by the company s then chairman of the board of directors 
in november  the company made a strategic decision to discontinue its efforts in this area 
in connection with this decision  the company entered into a severance agreement with the former chairman of the board of directors effective february   which provided for the continuation of his monthly salary through april  costs associated with the severance agreement  as well as other costs incurred related to this discontinued business venture were recorded in fiscal as a non recurring expense 
in addition  non recurring expense included approximately  accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal for lease payments associated with the early termination of the company s european headquarters facility lease  in order to relocate to a larger facility 
interest income interest income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and in fiscal from  in fiscal these increases were attributable to the interest earned on the proceeds of the company s initial public offering 
income taxes the benefit for income taxes in fiscal was the result of refunds of foreign taxes  offset by certain state taxes 
the company s provision for income taxes in fiscal represented the accrual of foreign taxes  federal alternative minimum taxes and certain state taxes  the resulting effective tax rate was approximately 
the company s effective tax rate of in fiscal represented the accrual of foreign taxes 
federal taxes for fiscal and were not provided as a result of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits 
the company s net operating loss carryforwards of  for federal purposes   for state purposes and certain general business credits of  expire in various years through based on the internal revenue code  the future use of these carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation should a change in ownership of the company s stock occur within any three year period

the company currently has no significant capital commitments for fiscal cash provided by financing activities in the year ended january  included  from the exercise of options and warrants to purchase common stock  as well as shares issued in connection with the employee stock purchase plan 
cash used in financing activities during fiscal amounted to  for repurchase of the company s common stock 
the company s international operations are principally transacted in british pounds and german marks 
translation into the company s reporting currency  the us dollar  has not historically had a material impact on the company s financial position 
additionally  the company s net assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currency has not exposed the company to material risk associated with fluctuations in currency rates 
given this and the relatively stable nature of the exchange rates  historically  between the british pound and the german mark  and the us dollar  the company has not considered it necessary to use foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments to manage changes in currency rates 
however  future changes in the exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the us dollar could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position 
the company believes that existing cash balances  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
additional factors that may affect future results fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company has experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipates such fluctuations in the future 
typically  revenues  operating income and net income for the company s fourth quarter are higher than those for the first quarter of the following year 
in addition  the company has historically recognized a substantial portion of its license revenues in the last month of the quarter  typically in the last week 
the company generally ships orders as they are received and as a result has little or no backlog 
quarterly revenues and operating results therefore depend on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
in addition  consulting service revenues tend to fluctuate as projects  which may continue over several quarters  are undertaken or completed 
operating results may also fluctuate due to factors such as the demand for the company s products  the size and timing of customer orders  the introduction of new products and product enhancements by the company or its competitors  the budgeting cycles of customers  changes in the proportion of revenues attributable to licenses and service fees  changes in the level of operating expenses  and competitive conditions in the industry 
the value of individual licenses as a percentage of quarterly revenues can be substantial  and particular licenses may generate a substantial portion of the operating profits for the quarter in which they are signed 
the sales cycle typically ranges from three to nine months  and license signing may be delayed for a number of reasons outside of the control of the company 
because the company s staffing and other operating expenses are based on anticipated revenues  a substantial portion of which is not typically generated until the end of each quarter  delays in the receipt of orders can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company also may choose to reduce prices or to increase spending in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities  which may adversely affect the company s operating results 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will remain profitable 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarters the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
regardless of the general outlook for the company s business  the announcement of quarterly operating results below analyst and investor expectations is likely to result in a decline in the trading price of the company s class a common stock 
rapid technological change  product transitions 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid technological developments  evolving industry standards  swift changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
as a result  the company s success depends upon its ability to continue to enhance its existing products  develop and introduce in a timely manner new products incorporating technological advances and respond to customer requirements 
to the extent one or more of the company s competitors introduce products that more fully address customer requirements  the company s business could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products or enhancements to its existing products on a timely basis or that any new or enhanced products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
if the company is unable to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to existing products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
competition 
the market for customer support software is highly competitive  and there are certain competitors with substantially greater sales  marketing  development and financial resources than the company 
among the company s major competitors are answer systems  inc  astea international inc  clarify  inc 
and software artistry  inc furthermore  many potential customers develop internal solutions by creating business applications that eliminate the need to acquire software and services from third party vendors such as the company 
the company believes that the competitive factors affecting the market for the company s products and services include vendor and product reputation  product quality  performance and price  product functionality and features  product scaleability  product integration with other enterprise applications  the availability of products on multiple platforms  product ease of use  and the quality of customer support services  documentation and training 
the relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the specific customer involved 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively with respect to any of these factors 
the company s present or future competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those offered by the company or adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
in order to be successful in the future  the company must respond to technological change  customer requirements and competitors current products and innovations 
in particular  while the company is currently developing additional product enhancements that the company believes address customer requirements  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements on a timely basis or that these product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete effectively in its market  that competition will not intensify or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
pricing 
the company believes that its products are competitively priced with other products in the customer support market 
however  the market for the company s products is highly competitive  and the company expects that it will face increasing pricing pressures from its current competitors and new market entrants 
any material reduction in the price of the company s products would negatively affect gross margins and could materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition if the company were unable to increase unit sales 
in addition  the company expects increased competition and intends to invest significantly in its business 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
management of growth  dependence upon key personnel 
in recent years  the company has experienced changes in its operations which have placed significant demands on the company s administrative  operational and financial resources 
the company s future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its key technical  sales and senior management personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s future success also depends on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key employees or that it can attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
product concentration 
the company currently derives substantially all of its revenues from licenses of cbr products and associated services 
broad market acceptance of cbr products is critical to the company s future success 
as a result  a decline in demand for or failure to achieve broad market acceptance of cbr products as a result of competition  technological change or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company 
possible volatility of stock price 
the trading price of the company s class a common stock has been and is subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies and that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the company s class a common stock 
uncertainty of proprietary rights 
the company s success depends in part upon its proprietary technology 
although case based reasoning technology is available in the public domain  the company believes its implementation of the cbr technology is proprietary 
the company relies on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
in december  the company was awarded two patents for its case based reasoning technology 
the company s cbr technology is embedded in its cbr family of products 
despite the precautions the company has taken  it may be possible for an unauthorized third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use the company s products  technology or other information that the company regards as proprietary or to develop similar products or technology independently 
in addition  effective trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries where the company operates 
the company is not aware that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that third parties will not claim such infringement by the company with respect to current or future products 
the company expects that it will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in the customer support software market grows and the functionality of such products overlaps with other industry segments 
any such claims  whether or not they are meritorious  could result in costly litigation or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
if the company were found to have infringed upon the proprietary rights of third parties  it could be required to pay damages  cease sales of the infringing products and redesign or discontinue such products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition
