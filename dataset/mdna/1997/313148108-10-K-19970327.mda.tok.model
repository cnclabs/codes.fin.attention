item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial information at and for the twelve months ended december  and is consolidated to include the accounts of farmer mac and its two wholly owned subsidiaries  farmer mac mortgage securities corporation fmmsc and farmer mac acceptance corporation fmac 
all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
overview in  farmer mac reported an annual profit for the first time in its history 
the thousand profit of which thousand represented an extraordinary gain on the early extinguishment of debt compares to a thousand net loss for those favorable financial results were attributable to a series of positive developments throughout the year  which marked a turnaround in the finances of farmer mac 
in january and february  congress passed and the president signed into law significant revisions to farmer mac s statutory charter  that have greatly improved its operating flexibility and efficiency 
consequently  was the first year farmer mac had the authority to engage in business in a manner that farmer mac s board and management had determined would be more conducive to the development of the secondary market for agricultural real estate and rural housing loans than was permitted under its original charter 
under farmer mac s new authorities  its operating structure is now more analogous to those of fannie mae and freddie mac its residential mortgage counterparts 
it is now authorized to purchase qualified loans directly from sellers and to issue and guarantee securities backed by such loans without the earlier statutory requirement of a cash reserve or subordinated interest  which had significantly increased the cost of its mortgage backed securities transactions 
under the act  farmer mac may deal directly with originators and sellers  thereby eliminating the expense and inflexibility of operating through intermediaries  as had been required under its original charter 
the act also included a number of other changes to farmer mac s original charter that improve farmer mac s operating flexibility 
farmer mac began to operate under its new authorities with an issuance of million of farmer mac i securities in june  which established new  competitive spreads for such securities 
that transaction facilitated forward sales of farmer mac guaranteed securities and thus the opening in july of a cash window facility through which farmer mac began to purchase newly originated qualified loans for cash directly from sellers on a weekly basis 
through january   lenders from states had applied for seller approval status  had been approved  were pending approval  and one had been denied 
through the same date  approved sellers had submitted for approval loans with initial principal balances totaling million  of which approximately met farmer mac s underwriting and appraisal standards 
no assurance can be given that the entire million will be sold to farmer mac 
operations in resulted in the securitization of approximately million of newly originated qualified loans purchased through the cash window or otherwise acquired by farmer mac 
in june  farmer mac filed a shelf registration statement with the commission to enable it to issue regularly and sell securities backed by the qualified loans it purchases through the cash window 
farmer mac guaranteed securities  known as agricultural mortgage backed securities or ambs  have been well received by investors  as indicated by the pricing of those securities at levels close to those of comparable mortgage backed securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac  although identical pricing levels have not yet been achieved due to the limited supply  and consequently lower liquidity  of farmer mac s securities in the capital markets 
management believes that improvements in the liquidity and pricing of farmer mac s ambs will result from an increased presence in the capital markets 
consequently  farmer mac is increasing its presence in the capital markets in through increased debt issuances and its presence in the mortgage backed securities market through planned monthly sales of ambs 
see results of operations interest income 
the frequency of issuances of farmer mac guaranteed securities will ultimately depend on the volume of loans purchased through the cash window or otherwise acquired by farmer mac 
in addition to the opening of its cash window  farmer mac introduced a swap program in pursuant to which sellers or other portfolio lenders may exchange their qualified loans for farmer mac guaranteed securities backed by those loans 
swap transactions are being negotiated with lenders and may involve loans with payment  maturity and interest rate terms varying from the standard terms for conforming loans farmer mac purchases through its cash window 
swap transactions offer certain advantages to lenders because the farmer mac guaranteed securities received in exchange for their loans are accorded a lower risk weight than whole loans under risk based capital guidelines and can be pledged as collateral and used in repurchase transactions 
in the latter part of  farmer mac expanded its marketing efforts to increase lenders awareness of the advantages of utilizing the farmer mac secondary market  including the swap program  and is currently negotiating with several prospective swap counterparties  although no swap transactions have been consummated to date 
as part of its expanded marketing strategy  farmer mac has also targeted non traditional agricultural lenders  such as mortgage bankers and agricultural supply and equipment companies  for which the advantages of its programs would result in a diversification of income sources and more effective utilization of their existing facilities and personnel  which may be accomplished at low marginal cost through access to their established customer base 
farmer mac increased its capital by million during  through two important transactions 
in april  shortly after enactment of its new charter legislation  farmer mac sold  newly issued shares of its class a voting common stock in a private placement to zions first national bank  salt city  utah  for slightly more than million 
to obtain additional capital to support the continued growth of its programs  farmer mac sold approximately million new shares of its class c non voting common stock in a public offering in december for net proceeds of approximately million 
by the end of the year  farmer mac had increased its capital from million at december  to million 
in addition  the new equity brought farmer mac almost above the million core capital required under the act for continuation of its guarantee authorities beyond february  more than one year ahead of the statutory deadline 
also in late  farmer mac and wfcb engaged in discussions that led to the settlement in early of the litigation farmer mac had commenced against wfcb under the strategic alliance agreement the agreement between the parties 
as part of the settlement  the parties terminated the agreement and agreed to other terms  including the waiver by farmer mac of certain restrictions in the agreement limiting the ability of wfcb to sell the approximately  shares of farmer mac class c non voting common stock sold or optioned to wfcb under the agreement  and the repurchase by farmer mac of the approximately  shares of class b voting common stock sold to wfcb under the agreement 
while other terms of the settlement are subject to a confidentiality agreement between farmer mac and wfcb  the settlement did not have a material adverse effect on farmer mac s financial condition 
notwithstanding the significant positive developments of  farmer mac still faces many challenges  particularly that of continuing to implement its legislative authorities in the very competitive market for agricultural and rural home mortgage loans 
having obtained the statutory authority to operate under similar guidelines to those of fannie mae and freddie mac does not ensure the success of farmer mac s programs 
to date  those programs have received only limited acceptance in the agricultural lending community 
a number of factors have continued to constrain participation in farmer mac s programs  including the historical preference of lenders  particularly system institutions  which are among the nation s primary lenders to agriculture  to retain agricultural mortgage loans in their own portfolios  the excess liquidity of many agricultural lenders  the disinclination of many lenders to offer intermediate term adjustable rate and long term fixed rate agricultural real estate loans as a result of the higher profitability associated with short term lending  and the lack of borrower demand for intermediate and long term loans due to the lower interest rates generally associated with shorter term loans 
even though the act removed those charter provisions that farmer mac had concluded were constraining the operation of the secondary market  most of the other enumerated factors  over which farmer mac has little  if any  control  may continue to exist as farmer mac continues to implement its new authorities 
if those factors persist  they will affect farmer mac s ability to generate the volume of loans necessary to sustain profitability 
as a result of the legislation  and the positive developments that have come from it  farmer mac now operates programs that are more accessible to agricultural lenders and which offer competitive loan rates and terms 
those programs must be significantly utilized  however  for farmer mac to realize its business development and profitability goals 
although the number of lenders approved to participate in farmer mac s programs and the volume of agricultural mortgage loans purchased thereunder have both increased since the enactment of the act  no assurance can be given that lenders will be willing to sell agricultural mortgage loans to farmer mac in the future on terms and in sufficient volume to ensure farmer mac s success over the long term 
a detailed discussion of farmer mac s financial results for the years ended december   and follows 
financial review balance sheet general 
during  farmer mac s assets increased by million  from million at december  to million at december  this increase in assets resulted primarily from growth in short term liquid investments classified as cash equivalents  securities available for sale and loans held for securitization 
farmer mac i and ii securities  net 
at december   farmer mac held million of farmer mac i and ii securities  million of which were farmer mac i securities and million of which were farmer mac ii securities

farmer mac reported net income in of thousand  an increase in earnings of million over the loss of thousand reported in net income includes an extraordinary gain of thousand resulting from the early extinguishment of debt 
without the extraordinary gain  farmer mac s income totaled thousand  a million improvement over the net loss of thousand reported in the increase in earnings is largely attributable to the gain on issuance of mortgage backed securities  a result of sales of farmer mac guaranteed securities backed by loans purchased through the cash window  and increased net interest income  a result of the shift from lower yielding to higher yielding interest earning assets  which was reduced by increased expenses associated with greater business activity 
the thousand net loss reported in represents a thousand or decrease from the loss reported in the decrease in loss from to was attributable to increased net interest income  a result of the shift from lower yielding to higher yielding interest earning assets  increased guarantee fee income from an increase in the level of outstanding farmer mac i and ii securities  and reduced expenses  as farmer mac focused on its legislative initiative rather than pursuing and marketing a program it expected congress to change through legislation 
farmer mac s profitability depends significantly on the volume of guarantee transactions in which it engages 
losses  if any  on guarantees will be affected by many general circumstances  including agricultural growing conditions  agricultural market conditions and the agricultural economy  and particular circumstances  including the quality of farmer mac credit underwriting  appraisals and loan servicing 
historically  the volume of farmer mac s guarantee transactions did not generate income in excess of operating expenses  requiring farmer mac to expend capital to fund operations  and resulting in annual net losses for each of farmer mac s fiscal years through december  the act removed certain charter provisions that were constraining farmer mac s activities in the agricultural secondary market  thereby improving its operating flexibility 
notwithstanding farmer mac s improved financial performance for and its ongoing efforts to implement its new authorities under the act  there can be no assurance that farmer mac will be able to achieve or sustain significant guarantee volume or profitability 
improvements in farmer mac s operating results will continue to depend upon the volume of new guarantee transactions  which  in turn  is dependent upon continued and significantly increased utilization of its programs by its class a and class b stockholders 
net interest income 
net interest income totaled million  million and million for the years ended december    and the million increase from to is primarily attributable to the basis point increase in net interest spread  the net result of the million increase in the outstanding balance of interest earning assets from to and the basis point decrease in the average rate of farmer mac s interest earning assets 
the thousand increase from to in net interest income is largely attributable to a basis point increase in the net interest spread  resulting from a shift in the composition of interest earning assets from lower yielding farmer mac i securities to higher yielding farmer mac i and ii securities 
the effective yield on the farmer mac i securities also increased from to as certain loans underlying the farmer mac i securities extended beyond their scheduled maturity date  thus generating interest income to farmer mac until the payoff date  and increasing the effective yield 
interest income 
interest income totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in interest income from to was attributable to the million increase in the outstanding balance of interest earning assets  which more than offset the basis point decrease in the average rate of farmer mac s interest earning assets 
the increase in the outstanding balance of interest earning assets was primarily attributable to the growth in the farmer mac ii program  which exceeded the repayments on the farmer mac i and ii securities  and the purchase of loans through farmer mac s cash window for securitization 
farmer mac issued million in farmer mac ii securities in  as compared to million in  almost all of which were purchased in both years by farmer mac for investment purposes  and had an average balance of loans held for securitization of million for the decrease in the average rate of farmer mac s interest earning assets resulted from a decrease in market rates which in turn lowered the average rate of farmer mac s investments and cash equivalents  almost all of which are floating rate  and the average rate of the farmer mac ii portfolio  of which approximately consists of short term adjustable rate securities 
the million increase from to in interest income is attributable to a million increase in the average amount of interest earning assets outstanding during as compared to  a result of million in net growth in the farmer mac ii program  and a basis point increase in the average rate of interest earning assets from to the increase in the average rate of interest earning assets was due to an increase in market interest rates  a shift from lower coupon  more seasoned farmer mac i and ii securities to higher coupon  newly originated farmer mac i and ii securities  and an increase in the effective yield of farmer mac i securities as a result of the extension of certain loans with balloon maturities underlying the farmer mac i securities 
in certain pools underlying farmer mac i securities  loans with balloon maturities are permitted to remain in the pool up to two years after the scheduled maturity date 
farmer mac and or the holder of the farmer mac i securities receives interest during that two year period 
during  management intends to increase farmer mac s presence in the capital markets  particularly the debt markets  in order to continue to attract investors in its debt and mortgage backed securities and so reduce its borrowing and securitization costs 
the board and management believe that increasing farmer mac s presence in the capital debt markets will improve the pricing of its ambs and thereby enhance the attractiveness of the loan products offered through its programs for the benefit of agricultural lenders and borrowers 
while the overall objective of an increased debt issuance strategy is to invest the proceeds in qualified loans purchased under the farmer mac programs  during the period in which farmer mac is increasing its loan purchases it will be investing those proceeds in interest earning assets  which will generate increased interest income 
see farmer mac guarantee program financing debt issuances 
interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended december   and totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
the thousand decrease in interest expense from to was attributable to the decrease in the average cost of outstanding interest bearing liabilities  which approximately equaled the effect of the increase in the average balances for the comparable periods 
during  farmer mac issued billion net of discount of discount notes and million of medium term notes and redeemed billion of discount notes and million of medium term notes 
the million increase in interest expense from to resulted from increases in the average amount and average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
during  farmer mac issued billion net of discount of discount notes and million of medium term notes and redeemed billion of discount notes and million of medium term notes 
other income 
other income totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  an increase of million from to and an increase of thousand from to guarantee fee income  the principal component of other income  increased thousand from to and thousand from to the changes in guarantee fee income were attributable to the level of farmer mac i and ii securities outstanding in each of the comparable periods 
gain on issuance of mortgage backed securities  the other principal component of other income  is recognized to the extent the sale proceeds of farmer mac i securities backed by loans purchased through farmer mac s cash window exceed the recorded value of the underlying loans 
the gain is net of any related costs associated with the issuance and sale of the farmer mac i securities 
in  farmer mac recognized million in gains on the issuance of million of farmer mac i securities 
other expenses 
other expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  an increase of million from to  and a decrease of thousand from to the million increase from to was largely attributable to increased costs associated with the implementation of farmer mac s expanded authorities 
compensation and employee benefits increased thousand or over  primarily as a result of the addition of four employees in the credit and business development areas 
professional fees  comprised of consulting  accounting and legal fees  increased thousand or over primarily because of the utilization of outside service providers to assist with the credit underwriting of loans submitted for purchase through the cash window and the development of a guarantee fee and credit scoring model  legal fees also increased due to the dispute with wfcb regarding the termination of the strategic alliance agreement 
marketing and advertising expenses and administrative expenses increased thousand and thousand  respectively  both as a result of increased business activity from the implementation of the expanded authorities 
the provision for losses increased thousand as a result of the increase in outstanding farmer mac i guaranteed securities for which farmer mac bears the risk of first loss 
from to  other expenses decreased thousand  primarily as a result of reductions in compensation and employee benefits due to lower bonuses paid to management  lower professional fees because of fewer special projects including a marketing study and a comprehensive asset and liability management review in  and lower travel related administrative expenses 
extraordinary gain 
in  the corporation recognized an extraordinary gain of thousand from the early extinguishment of million of debt 
dividends 
farmer mac has not paid and does not expect to pay dividends on its common stock in the near future 
dividends on the common stock are subject to determination and declaration by the board 
there is no preference between holders of the voting common stock and class c non voting common stock relating to dividends 
the ratio of dividends paid on each share of class c non voting common stock to each share of voting common stock  however  will be three to one 
if dividends are to be paid to holders of the voting common stock  such per share dividends to holders of class a and class b voting common stock will be equal 
risk management interest rate risk management 
interest rate risk is the risk that interest rate changes could materially affect equity and earnings 
farmer mac is subject to interest rate risk on its portfolio of farmer mac i and ii securities as a result of the ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled maturities and as a result of changes in interest rates during the period from the issuance by farmer mac of a loan purchase commitment until the loan is securitized by farmer mac 
mortgage prepayments can cause fluctuations in net interest income to the extent that they change the match of cashflows of farmer mac s assets and liabilities  as well as the amortization of certain deferred items 
this risk is mitigated by yield maintenance provisions  when present  which require payments to be made to farmer mac when mortgage loans prepay 
these payments are calculated such that  when reinvested with the prepaid principal  they should generate substantially the same cash flows that would have been generated by the mortgage backed securities had the underlying mortgage loans not prepaid 
the existence of these provisions reduces but does not eliminate farmer mac s exposure to reinvestment risk 
yield maintenance provisions are not contained in any guaranteed portions underlying farmer mac ii securities  which securities comprised approximately of farmer mac s portfolio of farmer mac i and ii securities at december  farmer mac s primary strategy to manage prepayment and reinvestment risk is to fund its portfolio of farmer mac i and ii securities with a mix of short term discount notes and callable and non callable medium term notes 
this funding mix is designed to match the expected cash flows of the mortgages underlying the farmer mac i and ii securities  while allowing farmer mac the ability to adjust debt maturities in response to prepayments 
farmer mac is subject to interest rate risk on loans purchased through the cash window 
weekly  or more frequently for larger qualified loans  farmer mac issues commitments to purchase qualified loans through its cash window  and from time to time purchases portfolios of qualified loans in negotiated transactions 
until those qualified loans are securitized  farmer mac is subject to the risk that interest rate changes during that period may materially affect the value of those qualified loans 
management employs a variety of hedging instruments  including forward sales  short sales of treasuries and futures contracts to mitigate the interest rate risks inherent in managing a portfolio of qualified loans including qualified loans under commitment and those held pending securitization 
as of december   all of farmer mac s interest rate risk management with respect to loans purchased through the cash window had been accomplished by means of forward sales 
commencing in early  farmer mac began to utilize a combination of forward sales and futures contracts to manage its interest rate risk and expects to continue to use a combination of hedge instruments 
management has established policies and implemented interest rate risk management procedures to monitor its exposure to interest rate volatility from prepayments and reinvestment risk 
management performs sensitivity analyses of farmer mac s market value of equity and net interest income and calculates the duration gap of its assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis 
these risk measures are reviewed regularly to determine the optimal asset and liability mix to limit farmer mac s exposure to interest rate risk 
credit risk management 
farmer mac maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover anticipated losses under the farmer mac i program 
no loss allowance has been made for the farmer mac ii program because the guaranteed portions are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states and are not exposed to credit losses 
at december   farmer mac s total loss allowance was thousand 
the farmer mac i and ii securities are shown net of their applicable allowance of thousand at december   representing an increase of thousand from december   the allowance for farmer mac guaranteed securities not held by farmer mac was thousand at december   representing an increase of thousand from december  the thousand increase was attributable to the issuance of million of farmer mac guaranteed securities as to which farmer mac bears the risk of first loss 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and considers a number of factors  including historical charge off and recovery activity noting any particular trends in preceding periods  trends in delinquencies  bankruptcies and non performing loans  trends in loan volume and size of credit risks  current and anticipated economic conditions  the condition of agricultural segments and geographic areas experiencing or expected to experience particular economic adversities  particularly areas where farmer mac may have a geographic or commodity concentration  the degree of risk inherent in the composition of the guaranteed portfolio  the results of its quality control reviews  and its underwriting standards 
farmer mac considers the amounts in the allowance accounts to be adequate to cover its exposure to guarantee payments in the farmer mac i program 
for a discussion of the composition of farmer mac guaranteed securities  see notes and to the financial statements 
at december  and  loans that were days or more past due  loans that were in foreclosure or bankruptcy and loans that had been acquired by the trust represented and of the principal amount of all loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities 
management believes that no losses will be incurred by farmer mac as a result of the loans in foreclosure or the real estate owned by the trust because of the existence of the subordinated interests with respect to the related securities 
liquidity farmer mac s primary sources of liquidity are issuances of debt obligations  and principal and interest payments on mortgages underlying securities purchased by farmer mac under the farmer mac i and farmer mac ii programs 
although farmer mac s debt is not guaranteed by the us government  farmer mac has been able to access the capital markets at favorable rates 
funds from the issuance of discount notes and medium term notes may be used in the farmer mac i and farmer mac ii programs to cover transaction costs  guarantee payments and the costs of purchasing guaranteed portions  qualified loans and securities including farmer mac guaranteed securities backed by guaranteed portions and or qualified loans 
farmer mac may also issue notes to maintain reasonable amounts for business operations  including liquidity  relating to the foregoing activities authorized under the act 
farmer mac also maintains a portfolio of cash equivalents  comprised of commercial paper  federal funds  and other short term investments  to draw upon as necessary 
at december  and  farmer mac s cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million  respectively 
capital resources the act established capital requirements for farmer mac  which were modified by the act 
certain types of assets and guarantees are required to be supported by specific amounts of core capital 
the act further defines capital levels as minimum or critical  the act phases in higher minimum capital requirements over a three year transition period 
certain levels of enforcement are given to the fca depending upon farmer mac s compliance with these capital levels 
see government regulation of farmer mac regulation capital standards 
as of december   farmer mac s minimum capital requirement was million and its actual capital level was million 
at december   farmer mac s minimum capital requirement was million  and its actual capital level was million

new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  which prescribes new accounting and reporting standards for sales  securitizations  and servicing of receivables and other financial assets  for certain secured borrowing and collateral transactions  and for extinguishment of liabilities 
sfas no 
is based on a financial components approach that focuses on the legal and physical control over the component 
under this approach  following a transfer of financial assets  an entity recognizes the assets it controls and liabilities it has incurred  and derecognizes financial assets for which control has been surrendered and financial liabilities that have been extinguished 
although the provisions of this statement are effective january   the fasb issued sfas no 
 deferral of the effective date of certain provisions of fasb statement no 
in december which delays  until january   the provisions of sfas no 
that deal with securities lending  repurchase and dollar repurchase agreements  and the recognition of collateral 
management does not believe that sfas no 
will have a material impact on farmer mac s financial results
