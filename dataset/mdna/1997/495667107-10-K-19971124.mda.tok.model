the company s results of operations are highly dependent upon the viewing preferences of television audiences and the company s ability to acquire distribution rights to  or itself produce  television programming that achieves broad and enduring audience acceptance 
the success of the company s programming could be significantly affected by changes in viewer preferences or the unavailability of new programming or talent 
moreover  the amount of revenue derived from the sale of retained advertising time is dependent upon a large number of factors  such as household ratings  the demographic composition of the viewing audience and economic conditions in general and in the advertising business in particular 
due to the success of the shows distributed by the company and in order to mitigate the influence of some of the factors referred to above  the company has been obtaining multi year licenses and license renewals from television stations for its principal distribution properties  extending as far into the future as the broadcast season 
in general  these licenses and renewals have been at rates as favorable or more favorable to the company than the rates applicable to the broadcast season 
all such licenses and renewals are contingent upon the continued production of the series by their respective producers through the broadcast seasons for which the licenses and renewals run 
the company believes that the impact of inflation on its opera tions has not been significant

liquidity and capital resources the company requires capital resources to fund development  production and promotion costs of independently produced programming  including  in some instances  advances to producers and talent  to produce its own programs and to acquire distribution rights to new programming 
in acquiring distribution rights from independent producers  king world has tried to avoid making significant capital commitments to such producers until it has obtained broadcast commitments from a substantial number of television stations 
as a result of this strategy and the success of its existing syndication properties  to date  king world has funded substan tially all programming acquisition  development  production and promotion costs and advances from its operations 
the company is currently funding the development and production costs of a talk show hosted by roseanne and a new version of the game show hollywood squares 
both shows are being distributed by the company and are scheduled to debut in the fall of the distribution of television programming is highly competitive and the company may be obliged to offer  among other things  guarantees and cash advances to acquire  renew or extend distribution rights 
under the terms of the company s agreement with harpo  inc harpo  the producer of the oprah winfrey show  the company has the exclusive right  and has agreed  to distribute episodes of the oprah winfrey show produced through the television season 
pursuant to such agreement  harpo and ms 
winfrey have also committed to produce and host the show through the broadcast season 
under the terms of its agreement with harpo  the company has agreed  among other things  to pay harpo production fees and to guarantee participation payments to harpo with respect to the and seasons at levels which are substantially higher than those that were in effect prior to the season 
in addition  following the season  profit sharing arrangements between harpo and the company previous ly in effect were terminated and  in the season and thereafter  the company will instead receive distribution fees based on a percentage of gross revenues derived from the series 
these arrangements are less favor able to the company than those contained in prior agreements between the company and harpo 
as a result of these changes  the contribution of the oprah winfrey show to the company s net profits and cash flow can be expected to decline 
after the television season  king world s right to distribute the oprah winfrey show  if not renewed  will terminate 
for several years  the company has been  and is now  in the process of devel oping new television shows for syndication that it hopes will gain wide spread audience appeal and generate significant revenues and income for the company 
two such shows  a talk show hosted by roseanne and a new version of the game show hollywood squares  are scheduled to premiere in the television season 
although the company hopes to renew its distri bution arrangements with harpo for television seasons following the season  there can be no assurance that a harpo and ms 
winfrey will continue to produce and host the show beyond that season  b even if they do continue to produce and host the show beyond that season  that the company will be able to obtain the distribution rights for any such future season on terms favorable to the company  or c that the revenues generat ed by these or any other new shows will be sufficient to offset the loss of revenues and income that would result if such future distribution rights are not so obtained 
the failure to renew such distribution rights on favorable terms  coupled with the failure of either or both of such new shows to gain widespread audience appeal  could be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and finan cial condition after the television season 
on january   the company paid harpo a million advance against its minimum participation payments for the broadcast season  which was fully recouped as of august  in addition  on january  the company paid an advance to harpo of million against harpo s minimum participation payments for the broadcast season  none of which had been recouped as of august  subsequent to august   the company also made advances to harpo in the aggregate amount of million against harpo s minimum participation payments for the and broadcast seasons 
based on the license agree ments in place for such latter three broadcast seasons  the company believes that revenues from the series will be sufficient to enable the company to recoup the advances for such seasons 
all of the advances paid to harpo are refundable to the company by harpo and ms 
winfrey if king world terminates its agreement with harpo due to harpo s failure to deliver episodes of the oprah winfrey show 
the company has used its cash reserves to make acquisitions of and investments in broadcast and related properties in the entertainment field  to repurchase shares of its common stock and to fund the cost of development  production and promotion of new programming 
the company continues to evaluate opportunities in these areas  and may seek to raise capital in public or private securities markets to finance such activities if it considers it advantageous to do so 
the company recently formed a new division  king world ventures  which has primary responsibility for the company s investment and acquisition program including analysis of new business opportunities 
on april   the company announced that the board of directors had approved a program to repurchase up to  shares of its common stock from time to time in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions 
through august    shares of common stock were repurchased in open market transactions for aggregate consider ation of approximately million or approximately per share 
the company intends to continue to repurchase shares of common stock in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions if and when it deems it advantageous to do so 
purchases under the share repurchase program will be financed out of the company s available cash and liquid invest ments 
on may   a special dividend distribution of per share was paid to stockholders of record on april  the company used approximately million of its cash and liquid investments to pay the special dividend 
the company has no present plan to declare addition al cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the company has entered into agreements with television stations for the future distribution of programming commencing with the broadcast season and extending as far into the future as the broadcast season  under which the revenues and related expenses will not be recognized until the license periods thereunder have begun and certain other conditions are satisfied 
as of october   the gross amount of license fees under such agreements approximated billion  of which approximately billion is payable to producers and others and is to be recognized as an expense 
the recognition of such amounts in the consol idated financial statements of the company in fiscal years subsequent to august  is subject to the company s continued distribution of such programming 
such amounts do not include sales of advertising time re tained during the broadcast of such programming or foreign license fees and do not reflect the production costs to be incurred for programming produced by king world
