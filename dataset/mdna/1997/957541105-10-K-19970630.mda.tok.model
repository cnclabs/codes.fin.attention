item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company commenced operations in as a provider of telecommunications network transmission products that enable advanced telecommunications services over copper telephone wires 
until fiscal  the company derived substantially all of its revenues from its ds and ds product lines  particularly the sale of nius and related products  which accounted for at least of revenues in each of the last three fiscal years 
the company introduced its first dsl products in fiscal and these products represented  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has also provided audio teleconferencing services since fiscal and consumer products claims processing services since fiscal revenues from audio teleconferencing services constituted of the company s revenues in both fiscal and and in fiscal in july  the company completed the disposition of kpins  its consumer products claims processing subsidiary  which is presented in the results of operations as a discontinued operation 
the company s customer base is comprised primarily of the rbocs  independent domestic local exchange carriers and public telephone administrations located outside the us due to the stringent quality specifications of its customers and the regulated environment in which its customers operate  the company must undergo lengthy approval and procurement processes prior to selling its products 
accordingly  the company must make significant up front investments in product and market development prior to actual commencement of sales of new products 
in late fiscal  the company significantly increased its investment in new product development based on emerging technologies  particularly adsl  and began expanding its sales and marketing efforts to cover new product lines and planned expansion into international markets 
international operations accounted for  and of the company s revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a result of the significant increases in research and development and sales and marketing expenses related to new product and market development  the company s results of operations were adversely impacted in fiscal  and the company expects to continue to evaluate new product opportunities and engage in extensive research and development activities 
this will require the company to continue to invest heavily in research and development and sales and marketing  which is expected to adversely affect short term results of operations 
due to the company s significant ongoing investment in dsl technology  the company anticipates losses in each of the fiscal quarters 
the company believes that its future revenue growth and profitability will principally depend on its success in increasing sales of adsl products and developing new and enhanced ds and other dsl products 
for instance  in the current fiscal year  the majority of the dsl revenue has been generated by data dial tone adsl shipments 
customer focus has migrated from video dial tone applications ie  video on demand  distance learning  etc 
to data dial tone applications ie  internet access  work at home  etc 
due to the growth in users accessing the world wide web through the internet and the need to increase the transmission speed when down loading large text  graphics  and video files 
in view of the company s reliance on the emerging adsl market for growth and the unpredictability of orders and subsequent revenues  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
revenues from ds products have declined in recent years as telcos continue to move from analog to digital transmission services 
the company also expects that revenues from niu products in its ds product group may decline as telcos increase the use of alternative technologies such as hdsl 
failure to increase revenues from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations

fiscal years ended march   and revenues 
revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively 
revenues increased from fiscal to and decreased from to the fiscal increase was primarily due to a million increase in dsl equipment revenues reflecting video dial tone trial shipments to two international customers offset in part by video dial tone trial shipments to one domestic customer made in fiscal ds product revenues increased million from fiscal to due primarily to overall unit volume increases which were offset in part by lower average unit sales prices due to change in product sales mix and competitive pricing pressure on unit sales prices 
the fiscal decrease in equipment revenue of million was primarily due to a decrease in dsl equipment revenues offset by an increase in ds equipment revenues of million 
the decrease in dsl revenue was more than accounted for by the absence of million in video dial tone trial shipments to two foreign telephone operators as telephone operators in general migrated their focus from video dial tone trial activity video on demand to data trials of dsl equipment 
dsl shipments in fiscal consisted primarily of data dial tone product shipments for field and marketing trials 
unit shipments of dsl products have increased  but have a lower average sales price when compared to the dsl product sales made in fiscal the lower average sales price of dsl equipment is primarily a result of product integration efforts 
the fiscal increase in ds sales was caused by overall unit volume increases and slightly higher average unit sales prices as a result of change in product mix which was offset in part by continued competitive pricing pressures on unit sales prices when compared to fiscal service revenues increased  and million in fiscal and  respectively  due primarily to increased audio conference calling volume from the company s conference plus subsidiary 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal and to in fiscal these decreases were due to product pricing pressures and changes in product mix within the company s ds and ds product lines 
in fiscal this decrease was offset in part by higher gross margins received on video dial tone units shipped to two foreign telephone operators 
the decrease in gross profit margin was also significantly effected by a reserve taken for adsl phase iii piece part inventories in the amount of million during the third quarter of this inventory reserve was the result of the new generation radsl platform reducing demand for the prior generation flexcap iii adsl products 
excluding the impact of this inventory reserve  the gross profit margin would have been for fiscal the gross margin for fiscal was additionally impacted by a large video teleconference equipment oem sale with a lower margin than the company s other equipment sales 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  constituting  and of revenues  respectively 
these increases in sales and marketing expenses were primarily due to staff additions  in both domestic and international markets  to support and promote the company s product lines  particularly adsl products 
the company believes that continued investment in sales and marketing will be required to expand its product lines  bring new products to market and service customers 
the company anticipates that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal and  respectively  constituting  and of revenues  respectively 
these increases in research and development expenses were due primarily to costs associated to additional hiring and increased prototype material costs to support new and existing product development for adsl  radsl and other emerging technology products 
furthermore  the company had received nonrecurring engineering project funding of  and million in fiscal and  respectively  for a customer sponsored research and development project that was not present in fiscal the company believes that a continued commitment to research and development will be required for the company to remain competitive and anticipates that research and development costs will increase in absolute dollars 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively  constituting  and of revenues  respectively 
the dollar increases in general and administration expenses were due primarily to additional personnel to handle expanded corporate infrastructure in domestic and international markets 
the company anticipates that general and administrative costs will continue to increase in absolute dollars as the company hires additional personnel 
interest expense 
interest expense was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
interest expense increased  in fiscal and  as a result of interest expense incurred by the company in connection with borrowings under its revolving promissory notes to fund expanded working capital requirements and  to a lesser extent  interest incurred under capital lease obligations 
the decrease in interest expense was a result of the company utilizing approximately million of the proceeds generated in the company s initial public offering of class a common stock in november to repay amounts outstanding under the company s revolving promissory notes 
benefit for income taxes 
benefit for income taxes was  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in each of these fiscal years  in addition to the tax benefit generated by the loss before income taxes  the company was able to utilize   and  respectively  in tax credits primarily generated by increasing research and development activities 
the company has approximately million in income tax credit carry forwards and a tax benefit of million related to a net operating loss carryforward that is available to offset future taxable income 
the tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in and the net operating loss carryforward begins to expire in quarterly results of operations the following tables present the company s results of operations for each of the last eight fiscal quarters and the percentage relationship of certain items to revenues for the respective periods 
the company believes that the information regarding each of these quarters is prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements of the company appearing elsewhere in this form k 
in the opinion of management  all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments have been included to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k

additional shipments of video dial tone adsl trial systems occurred in the september and december quarters to another foreign telephone operator but at reduced levels from the june quarter 
in the march quarter  telephone operators interest switched from trialing video dial tone systems for video on demand and distance learning applications to trialing data dial tone applications related to internet access and work at home applications due to the growth in users accessing the world wide web through the internet and the need to increase the transmission speed when down loading large text  graphics  and video files 
the company has shipped adsl systems in each of the quarters presented but at varying levels depending on trial level demands 
this variability has resulted in decreased revenue levels particularly from quarters which included large video dial tone shipments made to two foreign telephone operators in the first three quarters of fiscal service revenues have seen steady growth throughout the eight quarters presented due primarily to increased audio conference calling traffic volume 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues has decreased each quarter since the first quarter of fiscal as a result of product pricing pressures and product mix changes in each of the company s product lines as well as investments in manufacturing infrastructure for anticipated adsl production 
the second and third quarter of fiscal saw margins declining less significantly due to higher margin adsl video dial tone trial system shipments to a foreign telephone operator 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the gross margin was negatively effected by a reserve taken for adsl phase iii piece part inventories in the amount of million 
this inventory reserve was the result of the new generation radsl platform reducing demand for the prior generation flexcap iii adsl products 
excluding the impact of this inventory reserve  the gross profit margin would have been for the quarter 
the company believes that its gross margin in future periods will depend on a number of factors  including market demand for the company s dsl products  pricing pressures  competitive technologies and manufacturing expenses 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase gross margins in future periods even if its dsl products achieve market acceptance due to these factors 
operating expenses increased during the first three quarters of fiscal but decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily as a result of nonrecurring engineering project funding from a third party in the amount of million which offset research and development expenses as the company continued to make significant investments to support dsl product development 
operating expenses increased in each quarter of fiscal as the company continued to increase operating expenses  primarily the hiring of additional personnel  to support the development  introduction and promotion of dsl systems and other new products 
and  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  research and development costs were up significantly due to prototyping expenses related to the radsl and access multiplexer platforms 
the company expects to continue to increase operating expenses to support the development  introduction and promotion of dsl systems and other new products 
as a result of fluctuations in the timing of revenues of dsl products and increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses  the company currently anticipates net losses in each of the quarters of fiscal the company also recorded a charge of approximately  net of tax  in the second quarter of fiscal in connection with the disposition of kpins 
the company expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
the company believes that fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market price of the class a common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
factors which have had an influence on and may continue to influence the company s results of operations in a particular quarter include the size and timing of customer orders and subsequent shipments  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  timing of product introductions or enhancements by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in the telecommunications industry  competitive pricing pressures  accuracy of customer forecasts of end user demand  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the mix of products sold  quality control of products sold  disruption in sources of supply  regulatory changes  capital spending  delays of payments by customers and general economic conditions 
sales to the company s customers typically involve long approval and procurement cycles and can involve large purchase commitments 
accordingly  cancellation or deferral of one or a small number of orders could cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
because the company generally ships products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in large part on anticipated future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall of orders 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations and on its ability to achieve profitability 
liquidity and capital resources in november  the company effected the initial public offering of its class a common stock which generated approximately million in corporate funding 
the company used the proceeds from the offering to repay revolving promissory bank notes of approximately million which primarily financed working capital 
the company also completed a secondary public offering of class a common stock in june which generated million 
at march  the company had million in cash and short term investments consisting primarily of federal government agency instruments and the highest rated grade corporate commercial paper 
as of march   the company had no amounts outstanding under its secured revolving promissory notes and million outstanding under its equipment borrowing facility 
as of march   the company had approximately million available under these facilities 
the revolving promissory notes and the equipment borrowing facility require the maintenance of a minimum cash to current maturity ratio  a current ratio and a maximum debt to net worth ratio 
the company is currently in compliance with all such covenants 
the company s operating activities generated cash of million in fiscal and used cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
cash used by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from decreases in customer deposits and increases in receivables and inventory  offset in part by increases in accounts payable 
cash generated from operating activities in fiscal was a result primarily of decreases in receivable and inventory and an increase in customer deposits offset in part by an increase in short term investments and a decrease in accounts payable 
cash used by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from a loss from continuing operations of million net of depreciation and working capital required by an increase in short term investments and receivables  and a decrease in customer deposits 
capital expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
these expenditures were principally for machinery  computer and research equipment purchases 
the company expects to spend approximately million in fiscal for capital equipment 
in september  the company entered into an agreement to form a limited liability company  westell meridian llc llc  for the purpose of developing a acre site in aurora  illinois into a  square foot corporate facility to house manufacturing  engineering  sales  marketing and administration 
in connection therewith  the company currently has a equity ownership interest in the llc 
in december  the company began occupying the constructed facility held by the llc the aurora facility 
during the construction period  the company advanced the llc the construction funding  which as of march   was million 
the construction advances to the llc are non interest bearing in exchange for abatement of the aurora facility lease payments to the llc by the company 
had the company been required to make lease payments under the existing year lease agreement with the llc  the aurora facility lease costs would have increased by  for the three months ended march  minimum future rental payments under the existing lease at march  to the llc would have been  for each of the years through and  over the remaining term of the lease 
the company has the option to buy out the other investor in the llc and thereby purchase the facility developed by the llc or sell its interest in the llc 
it is management s intent to sell its interest in the llc within the next fiscal year  have the llc repay the construction advances and lease the aurora facility from a third party 
accordingly  the aurora facility is presented as a current asset held for sale and the minority interest related to the llc is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying march  balance sheet at march   the company s principal sources of liquidity were million of cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments and million and million available under its secured revolving promissory notes and equipment borrowing facility  respectively 
borrowings under the secured revolving promissory notes and equipment borrowing facility currently bear interest at the bank s prime rate at march  
these revolving promissory notes are due on  and the equipment borrowing facility expires in  september and the company anticipates that such revolving promissory notes and equipment borrowing facility will be renewed on no less favorable terms 
the company had a deferred tax asset of approximately million at march  this deferred tax asset relates to i tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  ii a net operating loss carryforward tax benefit of approximately million and iii temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts measured by tax laws 
of such tax credit carryforwards  the first  of credits expire in and  of credits may be carried forward indefinitely 
the net operating loss carryforward begins to expire in realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
although realization of the deferred tax assets is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income or by using a tax strategy currently available to the company 
on a quarterly basis  management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
this assessment could be impacted by a combination of continuing operating losses and a determination that the tax strategy is no longer sufficient to realize some or all of the deferred tax assets 
if management determines that it is no longer more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized  a valuation allowance will be required against some or all of the deferred tax assets 
this would require a charge to the income tax provision  and such charge could be material to the company s results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 earnings per share sfas no 
 which simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share 
it replaces the presentation of primary eps with a presentation of basic eps 
it also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted eps on the face of the income statement and requires a reconciliation between the basic eps computation to the diluted eps computation 
the sfas no 
presentation is required effective december   and will be adopted by the company at that time 
had the company calculated eps using sfas no 
 basic eps would not have changed from that presented for the year ended march  risk factors the following risk factors relate to the company s business environment 
before making an investment decision in the company  investors should review the following risk factors section which identifies certain risk factors that the occurrence of any one or some combination thereof could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on emerging market for adsl technology  losses the company s future growth is substantially dependent upon whether dsl technology  particularly as it relates to adsl systems  gains widespread commercial acceptance by telcos 
since  the company has invested  and expects to continue to invest  significant resources in the development of dsl technology 
however  the market for products using adsl technology is only now emerging as customers have recently begun to consider implementing adsl technology in their networks 
as a result  revenues from dsl systems have been difficult for the company to forecast  and the company s overall results of operations have experienced substantial fluctuations in recent periods 
the timing of orders and shipments of dsl systems can have a significant impact on the company s revenues and results of operations 
for example  during each of the quarters during fiscal  the company has generated dsl revenue but at varying levels 
this variability related to dsl revenue has resulted in a reduction in quarterly revenue when compared to the preceding quarter in four of the past eight quarters contained in fiscal and in addition  during the third quarter of fiscal the company reserved for million in piece part inventory primarily as a result of a new generation radsl product reducing demand for prior generation flexcap phase iii adsl products 
due to the company s significant ongoing investment in dsl technology  the company anticipates losses in each of the fiscal quarters 
the company s ability to achieve profitability or revenue growth in the future will depend upon market acceptance of the company s adsl systems and the development and market acceptance of other dsl products introduced by the company 
customers have deployed the company s dsl systems primarily for technical and marketing trials 
the company is unable to predict whether other technical and marketing trials will be successful and when commercial deployment will begin  if at all 
prior to selling its products to telcos  the company must undergo lengthy approval and purchase processes 
evaluation can take a year or more for complex products based on new technologies such as adsl 
historically  telcos have been cautious in implementing new technologies 
telcos and other customers deployment of adsl technology may be prevented or delayed by a number of factors  including lengthy product approval and purchase processes  decisions to defer product orders in anticipation of new product developments  cost  regulatory barriers that prevent or restrict telcos from providing interactive multimedia services  the lack of demand for interactive multimedia services  the lack of sufficient programming for interactive multimedia services  the availability of alternative technologies  such as isdn  cable modems and optical fiber  and policies that favor the use of such alternative technologies over adsl technology 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance that customers will pursue the deployment of products using adsl technology 
even if customers adopt policies favoring full scale implementation of dsl technology  there is no assurance that sales of the company s dsl systems will become significant or that the company will be able to successfully introduce on a timely basis or achieve sales of adsl systems and other products based upon dsl technology planned for future introduction 
due to increased competition  low barriers to entry  product pricing pressures and new product introductions in the company s core ds and ds markets  these ds and ds product groups are not expected to generate sufficient revenues or profits to offset any losses that the company may experience due to a lack of sales of adsl systems and other dsl products currently under development 
as a result  if telcos fail to deploy the company s dsl systems  and the company therefore does not receive significant revenues from dsl sales  then the company s business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected and there can be no assurance that the company will achieve profitability in the future 
fluctuations in quarterly results  lack of backlog the company expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
factors which have had an influence on and may continue to influence the company s results of operations in a particular quarter include the size and timing of customer orders and subsequent shipments  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  timing of product introductions or enhancements by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in the telecommunications industry  competitive pricing pressures  accuracy of customer forecasts of end user demand  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the mix of products sold  quality control of products sold  disruption in sources of supply  regulatory changes  capital spending  delays of payments by customers and general economic conditions 
sales to the company s customers typically involve long approval and procurement cycles and can involve large purchase commitments 
accordingly  cancellation or deferral of one or a small number of orders could cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly results of operations 
because the company generally ships products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in large part on anticipated future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall of orders 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
the company expects to continue to evaluate new product opportunities and engage in extensive research and development activities 
this will require the company to continue to invest heavily in research and development and sales and marketing  which is expected to adversely affect short term results of operations 
due to the company s significant ongoing investment in dsl technology  the company anticipates losses in each of the fiscal quarters 
the company believes that its future revenue growth and profitability will principally depend on its success in increasing sales of adsl products and developing new and enhanced ds and other dsl products 
for instance  in the current fiscal year  the majority of the dsl revenue has been generated by data dial tone adsl shipments 
customer focus has migrated from video dial tone applications for example  video on demand  distance learning  etc 
to data dial tone applications for example  internet access and work at home due to the growth in users accessing the world wide web through the internet and end users need to increase the transmission speed when down loading large text  graphics  and video files 
in view of the company s reliance on the emerging adsl market for growth and the unpredictability of orders and subsequent revenues  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
revenues from ds products have declined in recent years as telcos continue to move from analog to digital transmission services 
the company also expects that revenues from niu products in its ds product group may decline as telcos increase the use of alternative technologies such as hdsl 
failure to increase revenues from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and quarterly results of operations 
rapid technological change  dependence on new products there can be no assurance that the company s future development efforts will result in commercially successful products or that the company s products will not be rendered obsolete by changing technology  new industry standards or new product announcements by competitors 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  and evolving telco service offerings 
if technologies or standards applicable to the company s products or telco service offerings based on the company s products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance  then the company s business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
moreover  the introduction of products embodying new technology  the emergence of new industry standards or changes in telco services could render the company s existing products  as well as products under development  obsolete and unmarketable 
for instance  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company reserved for million in piece part inventory primarily as a the result of a new generation radsl product reducing demand for prior generation flexcap phase iii adsl products 
in addition  the company believes that the continued deployment of new technologies in the us  such as hdsl  in the local access network will adversely affect demand for certain of its existing products such as nius  which accounted for and of the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively  and that its future success will largely depend upon its ability to continue to enhance its existing products and to successfully develop and market new products on a cost effective and timely basis 
in this regard  most of the company s current product offerings apply primarily to the delivery of digital communications over copper wire in the local access network 
while the company has competed successfully to date by developing high performance products for transmission over copper wire  it expects that the increasing deployment of fiber and wireless broadband transmission in the local access network each of which uses a significantly different process of delivery will require the company to develop new products to meet the demands of these emerging transmission media 
the company s past sales and profitability have resulted  to a significant extent  from its ability to anticipate changes in technology  industry standards and telco service offerings  and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products 
the company s continued ability to adapt to such changes will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving its competitive position and its prospects for growth 
due to rapid technological changes in the telecommunications industry  the rbocs lengthy product approval and purchase processes and the company s reliance on third party technology for the development of new products  however  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully introduce new products on a timely basis or achieve sales of new products in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will have the financial and manufacturing resources necessary to continue to successfully develop new products based on emerging technology or to otherwise successfully respond to changing technology  industry standards and telco service offerings 
competition the markets for the company s products are intensely competitive and the company expects competition to increase in the future  especially in the emerging adsl market 
westell s principal competitors in the ds market are adtran  inc  pulsecom  tellabs  inc 
and teltrend  inc 
westell s principal competitors in the ds market are adc telecommunications  inc  applied digital access  inc  pairgain technologies  inc 
and teltrend  inc 
the company s current competitors in the adsl market include alcatel network systems  amati communications corp  paradyne  eci telecom  inc  ericsson  netspeed  agcs  diamond lane  us robotics  pairgain technologies  inc  orckit communications  ltd 
and performance telecom corp 
the company expects competition in the adsl market in the near future from numerous other companies 
in addition  the telecommunications act which was signed into law on february   permits the rbocs to engage in manufacturing activities after the fcc authorizes an rboc to provide long distance services within its service territory 
an rboc must first meet specific statutory and regulatory tests demonstrating that its monopoly market for local exchange services is open to competition before it will be permitted to enter the long distance market 
when these tests are met  an rboc will be permitted to engage in manufacturing activities 
therefore  rbocs  which are the company s largest customers  may potentially become the company s competitors as well 
many of the company s competitors and potential competitors have greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and human resources than the company 
any increase in competition could reduce the company s gross margin  require increased spending by the company on research and development and sales and marketing  and otherwise materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
products that increase the efficiency of digital transmission over copper wire face competition from fiber  wireless  cable modems and other products delivering broadband digital transmission 
many telcos have adopted policies that favor the deployment of fiber 
to the extent that telcos choose to install fiber and other transmission media between the central office and the end user  the company expects that demand for its copper wire based products will decline 
telcos face competition from cable operators  new local access providers and wireless service providers that are capable of providing high speed digital transmission to end users 
to the extent telcos decide not to aggressively respond to this competition and fail to offer high speed digital transmission  the overall demand for adsl products could decline 
in addition  the deployment of certain products and technologies for copper wire may also reduce the demand for the types of products currently manufactured by the company 
specifically  the deployment of hdsl in the us  which reduces telcos need for t repeaters and nius  may result in a decrease in demand for westell s ds based products 
further  the company believes that the domestic market for many of its ds based products is decreasing  and will likely continue to decrease  as high capacity digital transmission becomes less expensive and more widely deployed 
dependence on limited number of customers  lengthy sales cycles the company depends  and will continue to depend  on the rbocs and other independent local exchange carriers for substantially all of its revenues 
sales to the rbocs accounted for  and of the company s revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
consequently  the company s future success will depend significantly upon the timeliness and size of future purchase orders from the rbocs  the product requirements of the rbocs  the financial and operating success of the rbocs  and the success of the rbocs services that use the company s products 
any attempt by an rboc or other telco access providers to seek out additional or alternative suppliers or to undertake  as permitted under applicable regulations  the internal production of products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  the company s sales to its largest customers have in the past fluctuated and in the future are expected to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
the loss of such customers or the occurrence of such sales fluctuations would materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
bell atlantic and nynex and pacific telesis and sbc communications  respectively  have recently announced their intent to merge 
the company is unable to predict what effect either of these mergers  if completed  would have on the demand for the company s adsl systems or other products 
the rbocs and the company s other customers are significantly larger than  and are able to exert a high degree of influence over  the company 
prior to selling its products to telcos  the company must undergo lengthy approval and purchase processes 
evaluation can take as little as a few months for products that vary slightly from existing products or up to a year or more for products based on new technologies such as radsl 
accordingly  the company is continually submitting successive generations of its current products as well as new products to its customers for approval 
the length of the approval process can vary and is affected by a number of factors  including the complexity of the product involved  priorities of telcos  telcos budgets and regulatory issues affecting telcos 
the requirement that telcos obtain fcc approval for certain new telco services prior to their implementation has in the past delayed the approval process 
there can be no assurance that such delays  if experienced in the future  will not have a material adverse affect on the company s business and results of operations 
while the company has been successful in the past in obtaining product approvals from its customers  there can be no assurance that such approvals or that ensuing sales of such products will continue to occur 
even if demand for the company s products is high  the rbocs have sufficient bargaining power to demand low prices and other terms and conditions that may materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
dependence on third party technology  relationship with globespan many of the company s products incorporate technology developed and owned by third parties 
consequently  the company must rely upon third parties to develop and introduce technologies which enhance the company s current products and enable the company  in turn  to develop its own products on a timely and cost effective basis to meet changing customer needs and technological trends in the telecommunications industry 
any impairment or termination of the company s relationship with any licensers of third party technology would force the company to find other developers on a timely basis or develop its own technology 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the third party technology necessary to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products  that the company will obtain third party technology on commercially reasonable terms or that the company will be able to replace third party technology in the event such technology becomes unavailable  obsolete or incompatible with future versions of the company s products 
the absence of or any significant delay in the replacement of third party technology would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s adsl products are dependent upon a cap transceiver technology licensed from globespan technologies  inc globespan technologies is currently the sole provider of this cap transceiver technology and the company currently would not be able to produce any of its adsl systems without using this technology 
the globespan license  which expires in december  is nonexclusive and this technology has been licensed to numerous manufacturers 
the company has entered into cooperation and development agreements with other technology suppliers who are developing alternative dsl transceiver technologies  such as dmt technology 
consequently  in the event globespan fails to renew the globespan license  the company believes that it will have sufficient access to alternative sources of dsl technology prior to december so that it will be able to continue to produce adsl systems 
however  the cancellation or failure of globespan to renew the globespan license would materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations if other sources of dsl technology do not become readily available on similar terms or telcos elect not to deploy dsl systems utilizing alternative dsl technologies  such as dmt dsl technology 
in addition  the owner of globespan texas pacific group has formed a business unit paradyne that develops and markets products competitive with the company s products  such as adsl although this business unit does not affect the company s license and is a separate company from globespan  there can be no assurance that the formation of this business unit will not affect the company s ability to license cap transceiver technology from globespan after the license expires 
dependence on sole or limited source suppliers certain key components  such as integrated circuits and other electronic components  used in the company s products are currently available from only one source or a limited number of suppliers 
for instance  the company currently depends on globespan technologies to provide critical integrated circuits used in the company s adsl products 
in addition  certain electronic components are currently in short supply and are provided on an allocation basis to the company and other users  based upon past usage 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain sufficient quantities of integrated circuits or other electronic components as required  or that such components  if obtained  will be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms 
the company purchases integrated circuits from globespan technologies on a purchase order basis under a formal supply arrangement 
globespan technologies in turn sources the integrated circuits from lucent technologies 
the company anticipates that integrated circuit production capacity and availability of certain electronic components of its suppliers may be insufficient to meet demand for such components in the future 
integrated circuits and electronic components are key components in all of the company s products and are fundamental to the company s business strategy of developing new and succeeding generations of products at reduced unit costs without compromising functionality or serviceability 
in the past  however  the company has experienced delays in the receipt of certain of its key components  such as integrated circuits  which have resulted in delays in related product deliveries 
there can be no assurance that delays in key components or product deliveries will not occur in the future due to shortages resulting from the limited number of suppliers  the financial or other difficulties of such suppliers or the possible limitations in integrated circuit production capacity or electronic component availability because of significant worldwide demand for these components 
the inability to obtain sufficient key components or to develop alternative sources for such components  if and as required in the future  could result in delays or reductions in product shipments  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s customer relationships  its business and results of operations 
government regulation federal and state agencies  including the fcc and various state public utility and service commissions 
while such regulation does not affect the company directly  the effects of such regulations on the company s customers may  in turn  adversely impact the company s business and results of operations 
for example  fcc regulatory policies affecting the availability of telco services and other terms on which telcos conduct their business may impede the company s penetration of certain markets 
the telecommunications act lifted certain restrictions on telcos ability to provide interactive multimedia services including video on demand 
the telecommunications act establishes new regulations whereby telcos may provide various types of video services 
rules to implement these new statutory provisions are now being considered by the fcc 
while the statutory and regulatory framework for telcos providing video products has become more favorable  it is uncertain at this time how this will affect telcos demand for products based upon adsl technology 
in addition  the company s business and operating results may also be adversely affected by the imposition of certain tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on components that the company obtains from non domestic suppliers or by the imposition of export restrictions on products that the company sells internationally 
internationally  governments of the united kingdom  canada  australia and numerous other countries actively promote and create competition in the telecommunications industry 
changes in current or future laws or regulations  in the us or elsewhere  could materially and adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  the telecommunications act permits the rbocs to engage in manufacturing activities after the fcc authorizes an rboc to provide long distance services within its service territory 
an rboc must first meet specific statutory and regulatory tests demonstrating that its monopoly market for local exchange services is open to competition before it will be permitted to enter the long distance market 
when these tests are met  an rboc will be permitted to engage in manufacturing activities and the rbocs  which are the company s largest customers  may become the company s competitors as well 
potential product recalls  warranty expenses the company s products are required to meet rigorous standards imposed by its customers 
most of the company s products carry a limited warranty ranging from one to seven years  which generally covers defects in materials or workmanship and failure to meet published specifications  but excludes damages caused by improper use and all other express or implied warranties 
in the event there are material deficiencies or defects in the design or manufacture of the company s products  the affected products could be subject to recall 
for the past five fiscal years  the company s warranty expenses have been relatively insignificant 
although the company maintains a comprehensive quality control program  there can be no assurance that the company s products will not suffer from defects or other deficiencies or that the company will not experience a material product recall in the future 
complex products such as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
any product recall as a result of such errors or failures  and the associated negative publicity  could result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of the company s products and have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s standard limited warranty for its adsl products ranges from one to five years 
since the company s dsl products are new  with limited time in service  the company cannot predict the level of warranty claims that it will experience for these products 
despite testing by the company and its customers  there can be no assurance that existing or future products based on dsl or other technology will not contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
such errors or failures could result in warranty returns in excess of those historically experienced by the company and have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
risks due to expanding international operations international revenues represented and of the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the company believes that international revenues will represent a significant percentage of revenues in the future 
due to its export sales  the company is subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  foreign currency fluctuations which could result in reduced revenues or increased operating expenses  tariffs and trade barriers  potentially longer payment cycles  difficulty in accounts receivable collection  foreign taxes  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and telecommunications standards 
the company s contracts with its international customers are typically denominated in foreign currency and any decline in the value of such currency could have a significant impact on the company s business and results of operations 
for example  in fiscal  the company incurred a  transaction loss on receivable due to foreign currency fluctuations 
to date  the company has not engaged in hedging with respect to its foreign currency exposure but may do so in the future 
the company also is subject to general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  in connection with its international operations 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the company s proprietary technology to the same extent as do the laws of the us there can be no assurance that the risks associated with the company s international operations will not materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations in the future or require the company to modify significantly its current business practices 
factors affecting ability to manage and sustain growth the company is in the process of developing the manufacturing capabilities necessary to supply and support large volumes of adsl systems and in the future may become increasingly dependent on subcontractors 
the company has entered into discussions to establish subcontracting relationships for the assembly of its adsl systems 
a reliance on third party subcontractors involves several risks  including the potential absence of adequate capacity and reduced control over product quality  delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
although the company believes that alternative subcontractors or sources could be developed if necessary  the use of subcontractors could result in material delays or interruption of supply as a consequence of required re tooling  retraining and other activities related to establishing and developing a new subcontractor or supplier relationship 
any material delays or difficulties in connection with increased manufacturing production or the use of subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in increasing its manufacturing capacity in a timely and cost effective manner or that the possible transition to subcontracting will not materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
the company s failure to effectively manage its growth would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
proprietary technology  risk of third party claims of infringement the company s success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on its ability to protect trade secrets  obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the rights of others 
although the company regards its technology as proprietary  it has only one patent on such technology related to nius 
the company expects to seek additional patents from time to time related to its research and development activities 
the company relies on a combination of technical leadership  trade secrets  copyright and trademark law and nondisclosure agreements to protect its unpatented proprietary know how 
there can be no assurance  however  that these measures will provide meaningful protection for the company s trade secrets or other proprietary information 
moreover  the company s business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by competitors who independently develop substantially equivalent technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as us law 
the telecommunications industry is also characterized by the existence of an increasing number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement 
from time to time  the company receives communications from third parties alleging infringement of exclusive patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future  that assertions by such parties will not result in costly litigation  or that the company would prevail in any such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms 
further  such litigation  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by the company 
any infringement claim or other litigation against or by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel the success of the company is dependent  in part  on its ability to attract and retain qualified technical  marketing  sales and management personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and the company s inability to attract and retain additional key employees or the loss of one or more of its current key employees could materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
the company does not have employment contracts or noncompete agreements with any of its executive officers except richard riviere  the vice president of transaction services and president of conference plus  inc  a subsidiary of the company 
mr 
riviere has agreed not to compete with the company for two years after the termination of his employment with the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring or retaining key personnel 
expected volatility of stock price the market price of the company s class a common stock has been highly volatile since the company s initial public offering in november and has experienced extreme price fluctuations 
the class a common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market  which market has experienced and is likely to experience in the future significant price and volume fluctuations 
market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s class a common stock without regard to the operating performance of the company 
in addition  the company believes that factors such as announcements of developments related to the company s business  fluctuations in the company s results of operations  sales of substantial amounts of securities of the company into the marketplace  general conditions in the telecommunications industry or the worldwide economy  an outbreak of hostilities  a shortfall in revenues or earnings compared to analysts expectations  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  announcements of new products by the company or its competitors or developments in the company s relationships with its suppliers or customers could cause the price of the class a common stock to fluctuate in the future  perhaps substantially 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the company s class a common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations that are unrelated to the company s performance 
general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the market price of the class a common stock  and the current market price of the class a common stock may not be indicative of future market prices 
control by principal stockholders the company s capital stock consists of class a common stock and class b common stock collectively  the common stock 
holders of class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of the class b common stock are entitled to four votes per share 
at june   as trustees of the voting trust  robert c 
penny iii and melvin j 
simon have the exclusive power to vote over of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the company s common stock  according to the mutual determination by messrs 
penny and simon as to the best interests of the beneficiaries of the voting trust  consisting of the penny family and the simon family 
in addition  all members of the penny family who are beneficiaries under the voting trust are parties to a stock transfer restriction agreement which prohibits such beneficiaries from transferring any common stock or their beneficial interests in the voting trust acquired prior to november  without first offering such common stock to the other members of the penny family 
consequently  messrs 
penny and simon  as trustees  will effectively control the company and generally have sufficient voting power to elect all of the directors and to determine the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the stockholders for approval 
such control may have the effect of discouraging certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of the company  including transactions in which the holders of class a common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
anti takeover provisions the company s board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the relative preferences  limitations and relative rights of those shares with respect to dividends  redemption  payments on liquidation  sinking fund provisions  conversion privileges and voting rights without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of class a common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
while the company has no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock  any such issuance could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the company 
in addition  the company is subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company 
furthermore  certain provisions of the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation the amended certificate of incorporation and by laws may individually or collectively have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company and could have a depressive effect on the market price of the company s class a common stock 
for example  the company s amended certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that limit the right of stockholders to call special stockholders meetings and require that stockholders follow an advance notification procedure for certain stockholder nominations of candidates to the board of directors and for new business to be conducted at stockholders meetings 
no dividends the company intends to retain all future earnings for use in the development of its business and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future
