item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company designs  manufactures and markets radio frequency power delivery systems 
a power delivery system consists of a generator  which provides radio frequency power  and  in many cases  a matching network  which controls the flow of power into the customer s equipment 
the company s products are sold principally to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers  which use them as a critical component of the process chambers of the semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
the company s products are also sold to capital equipment manufacturers in the flat panel display and thin film disk media industries 
the semiconductor equipment industry accounted for approximately and of the company s sales in and  respectively 
over the past few years the semiconductor industry has experienced strong growth which has benefited the company 
in the second half of the fiscal year there has been a significant decrease in spending in the semiconductor equipment industry 
this impacted the company s second half fiscal year operations  most notably  the company s net sales and gross profit 
due to this slowdown the company has implemented a cost reduction program 
the future growth of the company will depend in substantial part on continued growth of the semiconductor equipment industry 
to date the company has been successful in achieving a number of design wins which have resulted in the company obtaining new customers and expanding relationships with existing customers 
the company believes that its ability to continue to achieve design wins with existing and new customers will be critical to its future success 
over fiscal years and  the company had experienced significant sales growth 
this growth has outpaced increases in operating expenses  resulting in significant increases in gross margins during this period 
in fiscal year  more specifically in the second half of fiscal year  sales in the semiconductor capital equipment market decreased significantly 
this affected the company s results  especially in operating expenses  which resulted in unabsorbed labor and overhead costs which are expensed as incurred 
the company has taken steps to reduce fixed costs and to bring variable expenses into line with the current pace of operations 
the company feels it is important to continue investing in the development of new products for the next generation of semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturing equipment  as well as for new applications of radio frequency technology in medical devices  food and material processing 
this is reflected in the research and development expenses incurred in fiscal year results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales

net sales to these industries increased for and for applied materials and lam research accounted for and of net sales for and  respectively 
gross profit the company s gross profit expressed as a percentage of sales was  and for the years ended november   and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit in is the result of the decline in sales to the semiconductor market which resulted in under absorbed labor and overhead costs and the additional inventory obsolescence reserves 
the increase in gross profit percentage  for years and  is due primarily to lower material costs and production efficiencies 
production efficiencies resulted from full integration of a computerized manufacturing system 
volume purchasing and lower costs resulted in a reduced cost of product 
research and development the company s research and development expenses are associated with developing new products and improving existing product designs 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended november    and  respectively  which represents an increase of from to and from to research and development expenses increased primarily due to the purchase of technology for the next generation of radio frequency power supplies and additional engineering staff to support the company s development program 
the company s ability to increase its research and development efforts is dependent upon its ability to continue to attract or train radio frequency engineers 
the company can not be assured of finding experienced radio frequency engineers because of their scarcity and the competitiveness of the market for these individuals 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
this represents of sales for the years ended november   and this represents a increase from to and a increase from to selling and administrative expenses rose 
million in and as a percent of sales was comparable to the increase is the result of costs related to the opening of a korean office and for its staff  a reserve for rent and other expenses for the company s old facility  write off of expenses related to a terminated secondary offering of the company s stock and professional fees related to a medical joint venture 
the increase of million in is the result of increased personnel in sales  marketing and service  increase in commissions resulting from increased sales levels and bonuses to company personnel based on profitability 
compensation from stock purchase agreements compensation from stock purchase agreements of  in fiscal resulted from settlement agreements entered into by the company  its former legal counsel and three of its executives to correct unintended tax consequences of these executives stock purchase agreements 
the settlement and compensation charge had no effect on cash  working capital or equity over what would have occurred had the unintended tax consequences not resulted 
income taxes in  the effective tax rate was which increased over the past year due primarily to an increase in state taxes 
excluding the  adjustment  representing a permanent difference  the effective rate for was 
the company s effective tax rate was for in the year ended november   the company changed its method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment which increased income by  liquidity and capital resources the company s cash requirements are currently being funded through operations coupled with the proceeds of stock options and bank financing 
funding in was provided from operations of  long and short term debt of  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of  the increase in capital expenditures of  in resulted from the purchase of machinery and equipment  computer software and hardware and leasehold improvements 
also   was spent in for a technology purchase consisting of the design for a switching system for the next generation of radio frequency power supplies 
in funds were provided primarily from operations of  and  of debt 
approximately  of funds were used for the purchase of machinery and equipment and computer equipment and an additional  was expended for a technology purchase discussed above 
excess funds were used to repay  of debt 
in funds were provided primarily from operations of  and  of debt 
approximately  was used for the purchase of machinery and equipment  computer equipment and transportation vehicles 
additional funds were used to repay  of debt 
in may  the company established a new banking relationship with a local commercial bank and terminated its relationship with its prior bank 
the company repaid it s prior bank s term loan and the outstanding balance on its line of credit from a new credit facility provided by the company s new bank 
the new credit facility is for a  term loan and a  revolving line of credit 
this increases the company s lines of credit from  to  as of november   approximately  is available through may on january  the company signed an amendment to the credit facility that revised a financial covenant in order to satisfy the company s compliance with such covenant at november  the company has the option to term out a portion of the line of credit  which if exercised  reduces the line of credit by the amount termed out 
in february  the company exercised this option for a  term loan 
in december  the company entered into a  loan agreement with the new jersey economic development authority to finance certain purchases of equipment for its new facility 
the loan is for a five year term at an interest rate of with principal and interest paid monthly 
the loan is secured by the equipment purchased with the proceeds of the loan 
the decrease in the company s trade receivables and inventories coupled with the related decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses are the result of the decreased sales volume to the semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers 
the company believes that funds generated from operations  in addition to its current banking line of credit  should be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements for the immediate future 
the company requires substantial capital for research and development and inventories 
however  the company s capital equipment requirements  although significant this year and also for the first quarter of fiscal  which will approximate  related to its new facility  will not continue to be substantial 
management of the company believes that the aforementioned funding  coupled with working capital generated by operations and the company s cost reduction program should be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements for the immediate future
