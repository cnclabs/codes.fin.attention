gross profit as a percentage of sales and operating revenues was  and during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit percentage in fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in perchlorate  sodium azide and environmental protection equipment margins 
the decrease was offset by increases in halotron and real estate margins

in october  the company received a purchase order for the delivery of ap to another customer from october through having a value in the range of million to million 
approximately million of this purchase order was delivered in fiscal this purchase order includes options that could increase the order during the period  and that could extend the purchase order to the year as a result of the above purchase orders  the company has a backlog of approximately million for deliveries of ap in fiscal in october  the company entered into the agreement with kerr mcgee

the company has entered into long term pricing agreements for ap with its major customers that are contingent upon the closing of the transaction and  on a continuing basis  that will be contingent upon agreement on terms of specific purchase orders 
there can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the transaction will be satisfied  or that the transaction will close 
sodium azide operations sodium azide sales were   and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
in may  the company entered into a three year contract with autoliv 
the contract provides for the company to supply sodium azide used by autoliv in the manufacture of automotive airbags 
deliveries under the contract commenced in july the estimated sales value of the contract is approximately million over the three year period 
the actual sales value  however  will depend upon many factors beyond the control of the company  such as the number of automobiles and light trucks manufactured and competitive conditions in the airbag market  that will influence the actual magnitude of autoliv s sodium azide requirements  and there can therefore be no assurance as to the actual sales value of the contract 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status of an antidumping petition the company filed with the itc and commerce in january  the company has incurred significant operating losses in its sodium azide operation during the last three fiscal years 
sodium azide performance improved in the fourth quarter of fiscal  principally as a result of additional sodium azide deliveries under the autoliv agreement referred to above  and the operations were cash flow positive during the year ended september  however  management s view of the economics of the sodium azide market indicated that the cash flows associated with sodium azide operations would not be sufficient to recover the company s investment in sodium azide related fixed assets 
as quoted market prices were not available  the present value of estimated future cash flows was used to estimate the fair value of sodium azide fixed assets 
under the requirements of sfas no

the company s equity in the earnings of the project amounted to approximately  and  respectively 
profits and losses of grllc are split equally between the company and its venture partner  a local real estate development company 
grllc s profits increased substantially during fiscal as a result of the sale of improved land zoned for an apartment site to an outside developer and a significant increase in residential sales 
the nature of real estate development and sales is such that the company is unable reliably to predict any pattern of future real estate sales or the recognition of equity in earnings of grllc

as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recognized a charge of  associated with employee separations and management reorganization costs 
in addition  relocation costs of approximately  grouped with operating expenses in the statement of operations  were incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company expects operating expenses to be approximately  to  lower in fiscal as a result of these separations and relocations

under this settlement  the company was reimbursed for approximately  in costs that had previously been expensed and incurred in connection with such defense

the company recognized a charge to operating expense of approximately  as a result of these terminations and the acceptance of the offer of enhanced retirement benefits by certain employees 
interest and other income the decreases in interest and other income in fiscal and are primarily due to lower average cash and cash equivalents balances 
interest and other expense interest and other expense was   and  during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the cessation of interest capitalization on the sodium azide facility

litigation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of litigation and contingencies 
inflation inflation did not have a significant effect on the company s sales and operating revenues or costs during the three year period ended september  the company does not expect inflation to have a material effect on gross profit in the future  because any increases in production costs should be recovered through increases in product prices  although there can be no assurance in that regard 
liquidity and capital resources as a result of the litigation and contingencies described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has incurred legal and other costs and may incur material legal and other costs associated with the resolution of these matters in future periods 
certain of the costs  if any  may be reimbursable under policies providing for insurance coverage 
the company has adopted certain policies in its charter and bylaws as a result of which the company may be required to indemnify its affected officers and directors to the extent  if at all  that existing insurance coverages relating to the shareholder lawsuits are insufficient 
the company has in force substantial insurance covering this risk 
the company s insurance carriers have reserved the right to exclude or disclaim coverage under certain circumstances 
defense costs and any potential settlement or judgment costs associated with litigation  to the extent borne by the company and not recovered through insurance  would adversely affect the company s liquidity 
the company is currently unable to predict or quantify the amount or range of such costs  if any  or the period of time that litigation related costs will be incurred 
cash flows provided by operating activities were   and  during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities declined in fiscal and increased in fiscal principally as a result of changes in certain working capital balances 
the company believes that its cash flows from operations and existing cash balances will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of its operations 
however  the resolution of litigation and contingencies  and the timing  pricing and magnitude of orders for ap  sodium azide and halotron  may have an effect on the use and availability of cash 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating its computer software and databases to determine whether or not modifications will be required to prevent problems related to the year these problems  which have been widely reported in the media  could cause malfunctions in certain software and databases with respect to dates on or after january   unless corrected 
at this time  the company has not yet determined the cost of evaluating its computer software or databases or of making any modifications required to correct any year problems 
as a condition of the agreement with kerr mcgee  the company will be required to obtain financing for percent of the purchase price 
the company currently expects that such financing will be available on customary commercial terms  although there can be no assurance given with respect thereto
