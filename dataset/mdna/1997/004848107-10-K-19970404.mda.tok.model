during  tower manufactured for its customers over sophisticated semiconductor products that are used by its customers or end users in a wide variety of applications 
these applications include personal computer products and peripherals such as microprocessors  local area networks and super i o devices  communications products such as pagers  office automation products such as facsimile machines  answering machines and advanced printers  cellular products such as cellular telephones and consumer products such as televisions and multimedia products 
the number of products which tower manufactures in and in future periods  and their end market distribution  is and will be determined by customer orders 
process technology tower s manufacturing process currently uses the following cmos complementary metal oxide silicon technologies micron double level metal  micron double level metal  micron triple level metal  micron double level metal  and micron triple level metal 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid changes in both product and manufacturing process technology 
as a result  tower s profitability will depend on its ability to successfully develop and introduce to production advanced process technologies which meet its customers needs 
tower is currently working on the development of i a specialized micron process for use in manufacturing wafers utilizing the proprietary embedded memory technology described above  ii a micron process and iii a micron process 
tower is currently running customer prototypes on the micron processes and expects to begin running prototypes on the specialized micron eprom process during the second quarter of tower expects to introduce both these new processes into production during  although there can be no assurance of this 
the process is scheduled for introduction in the development and introduction to production of advanced technologies is a complex process  the success of which is dependent on many factors  some of which may be beyond tower s control 
tower has in the past experienced unforeseen delays in the development and introduction of new processes 
tower can  therefore  not predict when or if the development and introduction to production of these new processes will be successfully completed 
the failure by tower to develop and introduce new process technologies successfully and in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on tower s business and financial condition 
see item description of business factors that may influence future results factors related to tower need to advance process technology 
manufacturing facility due to the sensitivity and complexity of the semiconductor manufacturing process  a semiconductor manufacturing facility requires a special clean room in which most of the manufacturing functions are performed 
tower s manufacturing facility includes an approximately  square foot clean room 
tower has obtained iso certification a certification with respect to business process quality standards for its manufacturing operations 
at the time of its organization in  tower s facility had a capacity of  wafer starts per month  using and micron processes 
since that time tower has increased its capacity to approximately  wafer starts per month at the current product mix utilizing  and micron processes 
this increase in capacity has been achieved through the addition of equipment  improvement in equipment utilization  the reconfiguration and expansion of its existing clean room area  and the construction of an additional clean room area 
tower does not currently intend to significantly increase the overall capacity of its facility 
tower intends  however  to continue to make significant expenditures during to fund its process technology advancement program and to purchase equipment to increase tower s capacity to manufacture wafers using advanced processes  including those currently under development by tower 
see item description of business semiconductor segment process technology 
competition the semiconductor foundry industry is highly competitive 
tower competes with other dedicated foundries and with integrated semiconductor companies and end product manufacturers that produce ics for their own use and or allocate a portion of their manufacturing capacity to foundry operations 
particularly during periods of market downturn  tower may face increased competition from its customers internal manufacturing capacity and from other semiconductor manufacturers who have underutilized capacity 
many of tower s competitors have more advanced technological capabilities  a more diverse and established customer base  and greater financial  marketing  distribution and other resources than tower 
in addition  some competitors of tower may have lower labor costs 
tower competes primarily by seeking to offer customers competitive pricing and a high level of service and process customization 
proprietary rights tower uses internally developed process technologies and process technologies licensed from customers 
the micron process used by tower and elements of the process used by tower are licensed from customers under royalty free licenses 
the micron process currently used by tower and specialized micron embedded memory process currently under development were internally developed 
elements of the micron and micron process currently under development will be used under royalty bearing licenses from third parties

factors which may affect future results the company may from time to time issue certain statements  either in writing or orally  that contain or may contain forward looking information 
there can be no assurance  however  that actual results will not differ materially from the company s expectations  statements or projections 
factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s expectations  statements or projections include the risks and uncertainties relating to the company s business described below 
general factors entry into new markets 
the company has recently devoted substantial resources to ventures to design and develop software products designed to address mass market product areas 
the company believes that these markets provide an opportunity to generate substantially greater revenues and profit margins than its traditional services markets 
however  the company has had relatively limited experience with marketing and distribution of such products and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop the marketing expertise and relationships necessary to identify and capitalize on opportunities in these product areas 
the limited operating histories of the company s new product ventures make prediction of their results and prospects difficult 
while the company believes that initial market reaction to its product introductions has been positive  it is too early to tell whether these ventures will become profitable and or whether the company will be able to recover the costs invested in such new products to date 
capitalization of software development costs  possibility of future writedowns 
the company generally capitalizes the costs of new software product development and amortizes these costs over the useful life of the product 
if the company is not able to complete development or is unsuccessful in marketing any of its software products  the company may be required to writedown any capitalized development costs related to such products 
as of december  the company had unamortized capitalized software development costs of approximately million associated with new software products and additional investments in development costs may be necessary to continue existing product development projects 
in the past  the company has taken significant write downs of software development costs and there can be no assurances that additional write downs will not be required in the future 
the write down of any substantial amounts of such capitalized costs could have a material adverse impact on the results of the company for the period or periods in which any such write down is required to be made 
minority interests in operating subsidiaries 
the company has a number of subsidiaries that are not wholly owned including its principal subsidiaries  dsi israel and tower 
cash of subsidiaries that are not wholly owned is generally not available for use by the company or other subsidiaries except to the extent paid to the company as reimbursement for general overhead or as management fees or as dividends 
dividends from the company s israeli subsidiaries are subject to a withholding tax of to 
competition 
in its computer consulting and development services business  the company faces competition from numerous other competitors  both large and small  operating in the israeli and united states markets  some with substantially greater financial and marketing resources 
in the help desk market  the company faces competition from a variety of companies with greater experience in the marketplace and greater resources available for product development  sales and marketing and product support 
these competitors include i companies that target enterprise wide information systems  ii companies with specific help desk applications  iii professional systems integration and services companies that design and implement custom systems  iv large information systems providers  as well as v the internal information systems departments of potential customers 
while the company believes that phd has certain product and price advantages over its competition  it may be difficult to educate its potential customers of the advantages of phd in light of the broad range of competing solutions 
the multimedia software market is characterized by intense competition among several large  well financed competitors  many of which have a comparatively long history of success in developing game and entertainment software 
entertainment software developed and distributed by these competitors vie for limited shelf space in computer and software retail establishments 
most  if not all  significant competitors have significantly greater experience in the development of entertainment related software than does the company 
in addition  many of such competitors have significantly greater numbers of sales and marketing personnel  larger advertising budgets and other resources to promote and support their products 
the market for personal computer and related peripheral hardware sales in which the company s databit subsidiary operates is characterized by severe competition in price performance  breadth of product line  financing capabilities  technical expertise  service and overall reputation 
trends have been for ongoing price reductions by manufacturers to end users  thereby reducing profit margins for distributors and value added resellers such as databit 
competitors include manufacturers  other var s  large equipment aggregators some of whom sell to the company and systems integrators 
many of the company s competitors have longer operating histories  greater financial resources and buying power and larger installed bases of customers 
the company feels that it competes primarily on the basis of its responsiveness and technical expertise in evaluating customer needs and tailoring specific solutions to those needs  as well as price 
dependence on intellectual property of third parties 
certain of the company s products development efforts are dependent upon intellectual property owned by third parties 
for example  the company s cybrcard products utilize intellectual property licensed from major sports leagues and players associations and related licensors while the company believes it is in continuing compliance with these licensing agreements and that the licensing agreements adequately protect the company s rights to integrate such intellectual property into its products  failure to maintain such licenses could have a material adverse effect on the business and prospects of the company 
rapid technological change  need for continued product development 
the market for the company s phd and cybrcard products are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving computer hardware and software standards  frequent new product introductions and continuing customer demands for expanded features and functions 
accordingly  it will be necessary for the company to continue to invest in product development to ensure that such products continue to evolve and remain competitive 
there can be no assurance that the company will have the resources to invest in such product development or if such product development efforts will be successful 
operations in israel 
a substantial portion of the company s operations are conducted in the state of israel and  consequently  the company is directly affected by economic  political and military conditions in israel 
accordingly  any major hostilities involving israel or the curtailment of trade between israel and its current trading partners could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
in addition  certain subsidiaries of the company receive grants and tax benefits from  and participate in  various programs sponsored by the government of israel 
there can be no assurance that such grants and tax benefits will be continued in the future at their current levels or at all 
the termination or reduction of certain grants  programs and tax benefits could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations 
substantially all of the company s sales are made in dollars or in nis linked to the dollar 
in  approximately of tower s expenses were in dollars or dollar linked nis and virtually all the remaining expenses were in nis 
the dollar cost of tower s operations in israel is influenced by the extent to which any inflation in israel is not offset or is offset on a lagging basis by the devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar 
there can be no assurance that tower will not be materially adversely affected in the future if inflation in israel exceeds the devaluation of the nis against the dollar or if the timing of such devaluation lags behind increases in inflation in israel 
as of december   the net amount of the company s monetary assets that were not denominated in dollars or in nis linked to the dollar was not material 
in the event that in the future the company has material net monetary assets that are not denominated in dollar linked nis  such net assets would be subject to the risk of currency fluctuations 
factors related to tower dependence on principal customers  need to expand customer base 
tower is currently operating significantly below capacity 
tower is making efforts to attract new customers to utilize all or a portion of its unused capacity 
tower is currently engaged in discussions with several potential new customers 
the process of attracting new customers includes extensive exchange of product and process information between tower and potential customers  including the running of test wafers and prototypes 
this process can be expected to take up to six months or more 
there is no assurance that tower will be able to attract additional business from new customers  in the near future  if at all 
tower currently has a limited number of customers and is dependent on its two principal customers 
if one of these principal customers were to reduce its commitment or orders  and tower were to be unsuccessful in selling to new or existing customers the capacity that becomes available as a result thereof  such event would have a material adverse effect on tower s business and financial condition 
risk of operating below full capacity 
fixed costs represent a substantial portion of the total operating costs of a semiconductor manufacturing operation 
as a result  any failure by tower to operate at or near full capacity  whether due to mechanical failure  lack of orders  fire or natural disaster  or otherwise  could result in losses or diminished profitability 
need to advance process technology 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid changes in both product and manufacturing process technology 
as a result  tower s profitability will depend on its ability to successfully develop and introduce to production advanced process technologies which meet its customers needs 
tower is currently working on the development of a number of advanced processes 
the development and introduction to production of advanced technologies is a complex process  the success of which is dependent on many factors  some of which may be beyond tower s control 
tower has in the past experienced unforeseen delays in the development and introduction of new processes 
tower can  therefore  not predict when or if the development and introduction to production of these new processes will be successfully completed 
the failure by tower to develop and introduce new process technologies successfully and in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings and financial condition 
risk of semiconductor process yield problems 
the process technology for the manufacture of semiconductor products is highly complex and sensitive to dust and other contaminants 
minor impurities or difficulties in the production process or defects in the masks used to manufacture a particular device can cause a percentage of the wafers to be rejected or individual ics or die on specific wafers to be non functional  which in each case negatively affects manufacturing yields 
although tower has implemented manufacturing control procedures  tests its products at various stages in the manufacturing process and conducts numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production process  tower in the past has experienced lower than expected production yields including yield problems with a specialized  advanced micron process in march  which have delayed product shipments and reduced profits 
there can be no assurance that tower will not experience lower than anticipated production yields in the future  which  if not cured in a timely manner  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
current downturn in semiconductor market  cyclical nature of semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry historically has been characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  the industry also has experienced significant downturns 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity and accelerated erosion of average selling prices of semiconductor products 
in some cases  these downturns have lasted for more than a year 
during  there was a downturn in the market for semiconductor products generally  which resulted in reductions in orders from customers and downward pressures on prices from both current and potential new customers 
no assurance can be given that tower s business will not be adversely affected in the future by cyclical conditions in the semiconductor industry 
procurement and sourcing 
tower s manufacturing processes use many raw materials  including silicon wafers  chemicals  gases and various metals 
these raw materials generally are available from several suppliers and tower is not dependent upon any single source of supply  although  in some instances  tower elects to purchase certain raw materials from a single source 
in those instances  tower generally identifies and qualifies alternative sources of supply 
although supplies for raw materials used by tower currently are adequate  shortages could occur in various critical materials due to interruption of supply or increased industry demand 
any such shortages could result in production delays which could have a material adverse effect on tower s business and financial condition 
in connection with implementing its technology advancement plans  tower expects to continue to make significant purchases of equipment required for semiconductor manufacturing 
some of this equipment is available from only a single vendor or a limited number of vendors and or is manufactured in relatively limited quantities 
in addition  certain equipment has only recently been developed 
delays in delivery and shortages in supply of such equipment  as well as failures of such equipment to operate in accordance with tower s expectations  could result in higher costs and production delays and delay implementation of tower s technology and advancement plans 
any such delays  shortages or failures could have a material adverse effect on tower 
risks relating to israeli government programs 
the investment law for the encouragement of capital investments  the investment law provides that capital investments in certain production facilities or other eligible facilities may  upon application to the investment center of the ministry of industry and trade of the state of israel the investment center  be designated as an approved enterprise 
virtually all of tower s existing facilities and programs  including tower s current million investment program and the million investment program which was substantially completed in  have been granted approved enterprise status under the investment law 
to be eligible for grants and tax benefits  tower must continue to meet certain conditions  including making certain specified investments in fixed assets 
the certificate of approval related to tower s current approved enterprise program requires  among other things  that all investments under the program be completed by the end of should tower fail to meet such conditions in the future  it could be required to refund grants or tax benefits already received together with interest and certain inflation adjustments 
there can be no assurance that such grants and tax benefits will be continued in the future at their current levels or at all 
dependence on senior management and key personnel 
tower is highly dependent upon its senior management team  many of whom have been working at the facility since national commenced the construction of the facility in the loss of the services of any member of senior management could have a material adverse effect on tower s business and financial condition 
tower does not maintain key man life insurance with respect to members of senior management 
tower also is dependent to a substantial degree upon its skilled professional and technical personnel and will be required to increase significantly the number of these employees in the future in order to implement successfully its plans for the future 
there is considerable competition for the services of qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry and  consequently  there can be no assurance that tower will be able either to retain its present personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel as and when needed 
in addition  tower may be required to increase employee compensation levels in order to retain its existing employees and attract and retain the additional personnel that it expects to require 
competition 
the semiconductor foundry industry is highly competitive 
tower competes with other dedicated foundries and with integrated semiconductor and end product manufacturers that produce ics for their own use and or allocate a portion of their manufacturing capacity to foundry operations 
many of tower s competitors have more advanced technological capabilities  a more diverse and established customer base  and greater financial  marketing  distribution and other resources than tower 
in addition some of tower s competitors may have lower labor costs 
possible shortages of raw materials and equipment 
although supplies for raw materials and equipment used by tower currently are adequate  shortages could occur in the future in various critical materials and equipment due to interruption of supply or increased industry demand 
any such shortages could result in higher costs  production delays or delays in tower s expansion  any of which could have a material adverse effect on tower s business and financial condition 
environmental matters 
tower is subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous materials used in its manufacturing process 
any failure by tower to use  discharge or dispose of hazardous materials appropriately could subject it to substantial liability or could require it to suspend or adversely modify its manufacturing operations 
in addition  tower could be liable for remedial measures if its properties are found to be contaminated even if tower is not responsible for such contamination  although tower s risk in this regard is reduced by an indemnity from national for violations of environmental regulations that occurred prior to tower s acquisition of the facility 
although tower believes that it currently is in compliance in all material respects with all existing environmental regulations  during the ordinary course of its operations  tower on occasion has become aware that its operations were not in compliance with certain applicable environmental regulations 
tower has resolved all such matters in a manner that has not had a material adverse effect on its operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that in the future tower will be as successful in this regard and the failure to resolve a significant matter could subject it to substantial liability or could require it to suspend or adversely modify its manufacturing operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that changes in environmental regulations in the future will not require tower to make significant capital expenditures to modify  supplement or replace equipment or to change methods of disposal or discharge or the manner in which tower manufactures products or operates its business 
item properties the company s corporate headquarters as well as the principal office for its united states operations are located in mahwah  new jersey in approximately  square feet of office space  under a lease which expires in september the rent for these premises currently is  per annum

these premises currently are occupied under a long term capital lease from the israel lands authority which expires in the lease rights under this lease were assigned to tower as part of its acquisition of the facility and the value attributed to the capitalized lease is being amortized by tower over the life of the lease 
tower has no obligation for lease payments related to this lease through the year item legal proceedings the company is a plaintiff in an action in the united states district court for the district of new jersey against a former officer who resigned in april  alleging destruction and misappropriation of property and data owned by the company 
the employee has filed a counterclaim against the company  alleging breach by the company of its employment and resignation agreements with the employee and seeking compensatory damages of  and punitive damages of million 
the company is pursuing its claims against the employee and is vigorously defending against his counterclaims 
the company accrued the full amount of severance payable under the resignation agreement at the time of such employee s resignation 
the company believes it is unlikely to incur additional material liability in connection with the counterclaim 
between june and september  several suits were filed in the united states on behalf of a purported class of tower s shareholders against tower  its co chief executive officers  its chairman of the board of directors  and dssi 
the complaints seek to certify a class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired tower s ordinary shares between may  and june  the actions have been consolidated in the united states district court for the district of new jersey 
the consolidated complaint filed in the actions alleges on behalf of the class that the defendants made misstatements and omissions regarding i the relationship between tower and a major customer and ii tower s process development efforts in connection therewith  in violation of certain us federal securities laws 
tower has indemnified the defendants  up to the limits permitted by the israeli companies ordinance  from any liability arising out of the actions 
tower maintains insurance policies  that  under certain conditions  cover actions of this type up to an aggregate amount of million 
the company is unable to determine at this time with any certainty the ultimate outcome of the aforementioned matter or its effect if any  on the company s financial condition  operating results and business 
however  the company believes it has meritorious defenses and is defending the actions vigorously 
the company is not involved in any other legal proceedings that management believes  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company

the selected statement of income data for the years ended december  and and balance sheet data as at december   and are derived from audited financial statements not included herein 
this data is qualified in its entirety by reference to  and should be read in conjunction with  the company s consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the statement of income data for the year ended december  includes tower s operations for the ten months commencing march  since the results for years prior to do not include results for tower  and the results for include only ten months of tower operations  the company believes that the results for these periods are not directly comparable 
the balance sheet data as of december  reflects the company s interest in tower as an investment on the equity method  not otherwise including tower s balances

whether such statements ultimately prove to be accurate depends upon a variety of factors that may affect the business and operations of the company 
certain of these factors are discussed at item description of business factors that may influence future results 
the company commenced providing consulting and development services for computer software and systems in israel in and in the united states in in march  the company diversified its business through the acquisition of a facility in israel that manufactures semiconductors using cmos process technology and the proprietary ic designs of its customers 
since such date the company conducted its business through two business segments the computer segment and the semiconductor segment 
due to changes in the company s voting control in tower  the balance sheet as at december  does not include tower balances 
the company therefore believes that these balances are not comparable with those of prior years 
commencing in  the company will account for its interest in tower s results using the equity method and will include its prorata share of tower s net income as equity income 
computer software services and systems the company s computer segment commenced operations in israel in with revenues attributable to the company s israeli subsidiaries accounting for   and of the total revenues of this segment during  and  respectively 
the decreasing percentage is primarily due to the increasing revenues from operations in the united states 
the computer segment s operations in the united states have had a cumulative operating loss since commencing operations in  reflecting primarily the significant expenditures intended to generate revenues over the long term rather than in current periods 
the company started to realize the benefits of these expenditures towards the end of  achieving significant revenue growth and improved operating results in these operations in in the company invested heavily in development and marketing of these products  resulting in increased operating losses 
costs relating to software product development are capitalized in accordance with applicable accounting principles for software development to the extent that they are incurred after the technological feasibility of the product has been established and management considers that these costs are recoverable from expected future revenues 
when the foregoing criteria are not satisfied  research and development costs relating to product development are expensed as incurred 
the company s results of operations for  and reflect million   and  respectively  of research and development expenses net of government grants attributable to the computer segment 
in addition  based on an evaluation by management of the net realizable value of software costs associated with certain of its products under development  the company recorded write downs and amortized previously capitalized software costs totaling million   and  in  and respectively  included in research and development expenses and costs of sales 
as of december   and  capitalized software development costs reflected on the balance sheet were million  million and million  respectively 
of such capitalized software costs as of december   million relates to the company s epsm product which is in beta test 
there have been no full product sales of the epsm to date and there can be no assurance that the company will in fact derive significant revenues from epsm 
the remaining balance as of december  relates to the company s phd professional help desk product 
the company has initiated amortization of capitalized costs relating to phd 
costs related to new software modules are capitalized in accordance with applicable accounting principles as described above 
the balance sheet as of december  also includes an investment of million in the company s cybrcard multimedia entertainment product  development of which has only recently been completed 
applicable accounting principles require that capitalized software costs be periodically reviewed and are written down to net realizable value 
possible additional write downs of capitalized software costs associated with the products above may significantly affect operating results in and future periods 
see item business factors which may affect future results general factors capitalization of software development costs  possibility of future writedowns 
gross profit margins in the operations of the computer segment  particularly in israel  continue to experience downward pressure due to increased labor costs resulting from the relative shortage of qualified programmers and engineers 
there can be no assurance that the competitive market place for qualified engineers will not continue to affect margins in future periods 
semiconductor manufacturing tower is an independent foundry manufacturer of semiconductor ics on silicon wafers 
as a foundry  tower manufactures wafers using its advanced production capability and the proprietary ic designs of its customers 
tower manufactures primarily differentiated ics rather than commodity products 
these ics are incorporated into a wide range of products in diverse markets  including computer and office equipment  communication products and consumer electronics 
tower commenced operations as an independent business in march  when it acquired its manufacturing facility from national semiconductor corporation the acquisition 
since the acquisition through the end of  tower increased its sales and profitability by i expanding its customer base  ii expanding its manufacturing capacity  through installation of new equipment  improvement of equipment utilization  reduction of cycle time and streamlining of the manufacturing process  iii reducing costs through improvement of equipment  process yields and operational efficiencies and realization of economies of scale  and iv advancing its process technology 
this allowed tower to improve its gross profit and operating margins from commencement of operations through the end of during  there was a downturn in the market for semiconductor products generally 
in june  tower announced that tower and hewlett packard had mutually agreed on the terms for ending the agreement for the purchase by hewlett packard of wafers from tower 
sales to hewlett packard accounted for and of tower s sales in and  respectively  and had been expected to account for approximately of sales in as a result of i the end of the agreement with hewlett packard  ii the reduction in orders from other customers and iii the prevailing weakness in the demand for semiconductors products generally  tower operated its manufacturing facility substantially below capacity for much of utilization improved during the fourth quarter of and into  primarily as a result of improvement in the personal computer and peripheral end markets and reduction by tower of its prices 
however  the situation in the marketplace remains uncertain and there is no assurance that utilization of tower s facility will continue at the level necessary to maintain profitable operations 
in addition  tower continues to see downward pressure on prices from both current and potential new customers

subsequent thereto  through the date of settlement  amounts are primarily unlinked 
the majority of the company s expenses in were in dollars or dollar linked nis and virtually all the remaining expenses were in nis 
the dollar cost of the company s operations in israel is influenced by the timing of  and the extent to which  any increase in the rate of inflation in israel over the rate of inflation in the united states is not offset by the devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar 
during  the nis was devalued against the dollar by approximately  while the consumer price index in israel increased by 
the company believes that the rate of inflation in israel has had a minor effect on its business to date 
however  the company s dollar costs in israel will increase if inflation in israel continues  as in the past years  to exceed the devaluation of the nis against the dollar or if the timing of such devaluation lags behind inflation in israel
