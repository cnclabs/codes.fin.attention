the company  through its subsidiaries and joint ventures  intends to deploy similar networks internationally 
although management believes these activities will have a positive effect on the company s results of operations in the long term  it is expected to have a substantial negative effect on the company s results of operations in the short term 
the company expects to incur substantial losses and have negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future  attributable primarily to the operating  sales  marketing  general and administrative expenses relating to the roll out of the us network as well as to a high investment in research and development related to its wireless communications activities 
the company may also continue to expend significant resources in pursuit of international opportunities 
there can be no assurance that the company will operate at profitable levels  have positive cash flow from operations  or continue to obtain financing to continue to implement its operating plan 
the company currently groups its operations primarily into two types of activities wireless communications and communications products 
the company s wireless communications subsidiaries are currently engaged primarily in providing trunked mobile radio services in the united kingdom and germany utilizing analog equipment  developing and selling wireless data solutions  implementing a digital wireless communications system for the united states that will provide integrated wireless communications services  and implementing digital wireless communications systems internationally 
the company is presently in the process of rolling out its us network 
the company started providing commercial services in philadelphia  washington  dc  baltimore  new york  boston  miami  dallas and orlando during the company had announced its intention to offer digital wireless communication services in over markets in the united states by the end of however  this roll out schedule was based in part on fcc imposed network build out requirements 
in connection with the company s acquisition of mta licenses in the recent fcc auctions  the company will be permitted additional time to complete the roll out of its us network 
accordingly  to better focus its financial and managerial resources  the company has revised its roll out schedule and currently intends to roll out its us network in additional markets in  three additional markets in and the remaining markets in the company s roll out schedule may be reviewed and revised from time to time in light of changing conditions 
the successful and timely implementation of the us network will depend upon a number of factors  including but not limited to the acquisition of additional financing  the timely and cost effective manufacture  construction and integration of the system infrastructure and software  the acquisition and control of additional radio spectrum  the procurement and preparation of base station and remote sites  the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals  and  the establishment of effective sales and marketing organizations and distribution channels 
the failure or delay with respect to any of these items could adversely affect the timing of the implementation of the us network in one or more of the company s target markets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in march  industry canada  the canadian agency responsible for spectrum allocation  approved in principle an award of certain mhz frequencies in the provinces of alberta  british columbia  ontario and quebec to a joint venture consisting of the company  cogeco cable  inc cogeco and techcom  inc  a canadian smr operator 
these entities had entered into a letter of intent to form the joint venture in canada to launch mobile wireless communications services based on the company s proprietary fhma r technology 
in july  the company announced that it had been unable to reach a final agreement with cogeco 
in october  industry canada granted the company and its remaining partner  techcom  inc  an extension to march  to find a suitable replacement for cogeco 
the company is actively negotiating with other potential canadian partners to replace cogeco so that it can begin deployment of an fhma r based network and comply with canadian foreign ownership and regulatory requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify a joint venture partner or  if such a partner is identified  that an agreement can be reached on terms acceptable to the company 
the company has until march  absent an additional extension to identify a canadian partner and file a site implementation plan with industry canada  or else the company may lose its canadian licenses 
the licenses have no termination date  but are granted at the sole discretion of the agency 
while the company believes that it will be able to retain the license until a satisfactory canadian controlled entity is formed  there is no assurance that the license will not be lost 
moreover  even if the company reaches an agreement with a canadian partner  there can be no assurances that the joint venture will be able to implement a fhma r wireless communications network in canada  which implementation shall be subject to the same risk associated with the implementation of the company s us network

the company s fhma r system currently operates in the mhz frequency band 
although the company believes its mhz development program will result in successfully adapting its fhma r system to the mhz frequency  such adaptation is subject to a number of contingencies and the manufacture of certain equipment required in connection therewith 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully adapt its fhma r system to the mhz frequency on a timely basis

currently  there are no tetra systems available for commercial application 
while some potential vendors have indicated an interest in supplying a tetra based system to nb  management of the company and nb cannot accurately estimate the availability  quality and costs associated with the implementation of a tetra based network 
management is continuing to work with potential vendors and regulatory authorities in the united kingdom regarding implementation of such system 
however  there can be no assurance that nb will be able to implement such a system or  if implemented  when nb will be in a position to roll out a tetra based system

the company s short term cash needs are attributable primarily to capital expenditures  marketing and general and administrative expenses and research and development costs associated with the implementation and deployment of its digital fhma r networks 
one of the advantages of the company s fhma r system is its modularity  which allows the company to execute a flexible roll out plan requiring a relatively low investment in infrastructure in a given geographical area compared to other wireless communications systems in order to provide initial commercial service

the company is currently pursuing various alternatives for raising capital including issuance of equity and debt securities  as well as a combination thereof and other sources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any such financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
the failure to obtain such financing will cause the company to significantly alter its us network roll out plan  financing its international digital wireless networks and joint ventures  and  defer certain discretionary expenditures

although the company believes that the marcrocellular architecture of its fhma r network will permit the company to control its cash expenditures to a limited extent by focusing its activities in certain markets while reducing or delaying its activities in other markets  the failure by the company to obtain necessary financing on a timely basis may prevent the company from expanding coverage  adding subscribers or offering additional services in some or all of its us markets and forego certain international opportunities 
the company is considering a number of alternatives to raise additional financing including  but not limited to  public or private equity or debt financing  bank loans  strategic partners  joint ventures  vendor financing  leasing arrangements or a combination of these sources 
the documents governing the company s outstanding indebtedness impose certain significant operating and financial restrictions on the company  which limit  among other things  the company s ability to incur indebtedness  make prepayments of certain indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments  and engage in mergers and acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional financing on a timely basis or on acceptable terms 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standard board issued statement no 
earnings per share which is applicable for financial statements issued after december  the adoption of this standard will have no impact on the company as the company is in a loss position and only needs to present basic earnings per share as the inclusion of common stock equivalents or convertible securities has an antidilutive effect on the calculation of earnings per share
