the company has foreign exchange rate risk related to international group operations and cash flows 
the company has historically entered into forward foreign exchange contracts and purchased currency options to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
these contracts generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at some future date 
counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
gains and losses on these contracts generally offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
effective in the second quarter of  the company significantly reduced this program  while it reassesses its foreign exchange policy in light of actions taken internally to reduce such exposures 
realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized and offset foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying exposures 
unrealized gains and losses that are designated and effective as hedges on such transactions are deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions 
as of september   the company s european operations had foreign exchange risk in various european currencies tied to the dutch guilder 
these currencies include the belgian franc  german mark  spanish peseta  french franc  british pound  italian lire  australian dollar and us dollar

the company is involved in several environmental related legal actions with various governmental agencies 
while it is difficult to quantify the potential financial impact of actions involving environmental matters  particularly remediation costs at waste disposal sites and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  in the opinion of management  the ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters  taking into account established reserves  should not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  however  there can be no assurance that future quarterly or annual operating results will not be materially affected by the resolution of these matters 
additional information on environmental matters affecting the company is provided in note to the company s consolidated financial statements and in this annual report on form k under the business and legal proceedings sections
