item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
sales and markets forest s us production is generally sold at the wellhead to oil and natural gas purchasing companies in the areas where it is produced 
crude oil and condensate are typically sold at prices which are based upon posted field prices 
natural gas in the us is generally sold month to month on the spot market 
for the month of march  approximately of the company s us natural gas was sold at the wellhead at spot market prices 
the term spot market as used herein refers to contracts with a term of six months or less or contracts which call for a redetermination of sales prices every six months or earlier 
the remainder of the company s us natural gas was committed to both interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline companies  primarily under volumetric production payment agreements and long term contracts 
the company believes that the loss of one or more of its current natural gas spot purchasers should not have a material adverse effect on the company s business in the united states because any individual spot purchaser could be readily replaced by another spot purchaser who would pay approximately the same sales price 
in canada  canadian forest s natural gas production is sold primarily through the promark netback pool 
the netback pool matches major end users with providers of gas supply through arranged transportation channels and uses a netback pricing mechanism to establish the wellhead price paid to producers 
under this netback arrangement  producers receive the blended market price less related transportation and other direct costs 
promark charges a marketing fee for marketing and administering the gas supply pool 
canadian forest sold approximately of its natural gas production through the netback pool in the netback pool gas sales in averaged mmcf per day  of which canadian forest supplied approximately mmcf per day or 
approximately of the volumes sold in the netback pool in were sold at fixed prices under long term contracts 
the loss of one or more of such long term buyers could have a material adverse effect on promark and canadian forest 
in addition to operating the netback pool  promark provides two other marketing services for producers and purchasers of natural gas 
promark manages long term gas supply contracts for its industrial customers by providing full service purchasing  accounting and gas nomination services for these customers on a fee for services basis 
promark also buys and sells gas in its trading operation for terms as short as one day and as long as one to two years 
profits generated by trading are derived from the spread between the prices of gas purchased and sold 
promark endeavors to offset its gas purchase or sales commitments with other gas purchase or sales contracts  thereby limiting its exposure to price risk 
the company is  however  exposed to credit risk in that there exists the possibility that the counterparties to agreements will fail to perform their contractual obligations 
substantially all of forest s oil production in the us and canada is sold under short term contracts at prices which are based upon posted field prices 
for information concerning sales to major customers  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other foreign operations forest considers  from time to time  certain oil and gas opportunities in other foreign countries 
foreign oil and natural gas operations are subject to certain risks  such as nationalization  confiscation  terrorism  renegotiation of existing contracts and currency fluctuations 
forest monitors the political  regulatory and economic developments in any foreign countries in which it operates 
competition the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive 
competition is particularly intense in the acquisition of prospective oil and natural gas properties and oil and gas reserves 
forest s competitive position depends on its geological  geophysical and engineering expertise  on its financial resources  its ability to develop its properties and its ability to select  acquire and develop proved reserves 
forest competes with a substantial number of other companies having larger technical staffs and greater financial and operational resources 
many such companies not only engage in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas reserves  but also carry on refining operations  generate electricity and market refined products 
the company also competes with major and independent oil and gas companies in the marketing and sale of oil and gas to transporters  distributors and end users 
there is also competition between the oil and natural gas industry and other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
forest also competes with other oil and natural gas companies in attempting to secure drilling rigs and other equipment necessary for drilling and completion of wells 
such equipment may be in short supply from time to time 
finally  companies not previously investing in oil and natural gas may choose to acquire reserves to establish a firm supply or simply as an investment 
such companies will also provide competition for forest 
forest s business is affected not only by such competition  but also by general economic developments  governmental regulations and other factors that affect its ability to market its oil and natural gas production 
the prices of oil and natural gas realized by forest are highly volatile 
the price of oil is generally dependent on world supply and demand  while the price forest receives for its natural gas is tied to the specific markets in which such gas is sold 
declines in crude oil prices or natural gas prices adversely impact forest s activities 
the company s financial position and resources may also adversely affect the company s competitive position 
lack of available funds or financing alternatives will prevent the company from executing its operating strategy and from deriving the expected benefits therefrom 
for further information concerning the company s financial position  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
promark also faces significant competition from other gas marketers  some of whom are significantly larger in size and have greater financial resources than promark  canadian forest or the company 
regulation united states 
various aspects of the company s oil and natural gas operations are regulated by administrative agencies under statutory provisions of the states where such operations are conducted and by certain agencies of the federal government for operations on federal leases 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the natural gas act of nga and the natural gas policy act of ngpa 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which oil and gas could be sold 
while sales by producers of natural gas  and all sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
deregulation of wellhead sales in the natural gas industry began with the enactment of the ngpa in in  congress enacted the natural gas wellhead decontrol act the decontrol act 
the decontrol act removed all nga and ngpa price and nonprice controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  commencing in april  the ferc issued order nos 
 a  b and c order no 
 which require interstate pipelines to provide transportation separate  or unbundled  from the pipelines sales of gas 
also  order no 
requires pipelines to provide open access transportation on a basis that is equal for all gas supplies 
although order no 
does not directly regulate the company s activities  the ferc has stated that it intends for order no 
to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
it is unclear what impact  if any  increased competition within the natural gas industry under order no 
will have on the company s activities 
although order no 
 assuming it is upheld in its entirety  could provide the company with additional market access and more fairly applied transportation service rates  order no 
could also subject the company to more restrictive pipeline imbalance tolerances and greater penalties for violation of those tolerances 
order and subsequent ferc orders issued in individual pipeline restructuring proceedings have been the subject of appeals  the results of which have generally supported the ferc s open access policy 
last year  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit largely upheld order no 
because further review of certain of these orders is still possible and other appeals remain pending  it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of the orders on the company and its production efforts 
the ferc has announced several important transportation related policy statements and proposed rule changes  including the appropriate manner in which interstate pipelines release capacity under order no 
and  more recently  the price which shippers can charge for their released capacity 
in addition  in  ferc issued a policy statement on how interstate natural gas pipelines can recover the costs of new pipeline facilities 
in january  the ferc issued a policy statement and a request for comments concerning alternatives to its traditional cost of service ratemaking methodology 
a number of pipelines have obtained ferc authorization to charge negotiated rates as one such alternative 
while any additional ferc action on these matters would affect the company only indirectly  these policy statements and proposed rule changes are intended to further enhance competition in natural gas markets 
the company cannot predict what action the ferc will take on these matters  nor can it predict whether the ferc s actions will achieve its stated goal of increasing competition in natural gas markets 
however  the company does not believe that it will be treated materially differently than other natural gas producers and markets with which it competes 
commencing in october  the ferc issued a series of rules order nos 
and a establishing an indexing system under which oil pipelines will be able to change their transportation rates  subject to prescribed ceiling levels 
the indexing system  which allows or may require pipelines to make rate changes to track changes in the producer price index for finished goods  minus one percent  became effective january  the company is not able at this time to predict the effects of order nos 
and a  if any  on the transportation costs associated with oil production from the company s oil producing operations 
the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf the ocs provide open access  non discriminatory service 
although the ferc has opted not to impose the regulations of order no 
 in which the ferc implemented the ocsla  on gatherers and other non jurisdictional entities  the ferc has retained the authority to exercise jurisdiction over those entities if necessary to permit non discriminatory access to service or the ocs 
certain operations the company conducts are on federal oil and gas leases  which the minerals management service mms administers 
the mms issues such leases through competitive bidding 
these leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed mms regulations and orders pursuant to the ocsla which are subject to change by the mms 
for offshore operations  lessees must obtain mms approval for exploration plans and development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations 
in addition to permits required from other agencies such as the coast guard  the army corps of engineers and the environmental protection agency  lessees must obtain a permit from the mms prior to the commencement of drilling 
the mms has promulgated regulations requiring offshore production facilities located on the ocs to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications 
the mms proposed additional safety related regulations concerning the design and operating procedures for ocs production platforms and pipelines 
these proposed regulations were withdrawn pending further discussions among interested federal agencies 
the mms also has regulations restricting the flaring or venting of natural gas and has recently proposed to amend such regulations to prohibit the flaring of liquid hydrocarbons and oil without prior authorization 
similarly  the mms has promulgated other regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the removal of all production facilities 
to cover the various obligations of lessees on the ocs  the mms generally requires that lessees post substantial bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met 
the cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that the company can continue to obtain bonds or other surety in all cases 
under certain circumstances  the mms may require any company operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated 
any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition and operations 
in addition  the mms is conducting an inquiry into certain contract agreements from which producers on mms leases have received settlement proceeds that are royalty bearing and the extent to which producers have paid the appropriate royalties on those proceeds 
the company believes that this inquiry will not have a material impact on its financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
the mms has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in which it proposes to amend its regulations governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of natural gas produced from federal leases 
the principal feature in the amendments  as proposed  would establish an alternative market index based method to calculate royalties on certain natural gas production sold to affiliates or pursuant to non arm s length sales contracts 
the mms has proposed this rulemaking to facilitate royalty valuation in light of changes in the gas marketing environment 
the company cannot predict what action the mms will take on these matters  nor can it predict at this stage of the rulemaking proceeding how the company might be affected by amendments to the regulations 
the mms has also issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in which it proposes to amend its regulations governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases 
this proposed rule would modify the valuation procedures for both arm s length and non arm s length crude oil transactions to decrease reliance on oil posted prices and assign a value to crude oil that better reflects market value  establish a new mms form for collecting value differential data  and amend the valuation procedure for the sale of federal royalty oil 
the company cannot predict what action the mms will take on this matter  nor can it predict at this stage of the rulemaking proceeding how the company might be affected by this amendment to the mms regulations 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are pending before the ferc and the courts 
the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 
in the past  the natural gas industry has been heavily regulated 
there is no assurance that the regulatory approach currently pursued by the ferc will continue indefinitely 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the company does not anticipate that compliance with existing federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations will have a material or significantly adverse effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of the company or its subsidiaries 
no material portion of forest s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the federal government 
oil spill financial responsibility requirements united states 
as originally enacted  the oil pollution act of opa would have required the company to establish million in financial responsibility to cover oil spill related liabilities 
under recent amendments to the opa  the responsible person for an offshore facility located seaward of state waters  including ocs facilities  will be required to provide evidence of financial responsibility in the amount of million 
although the financial responsibility requirement for offshore facilities located landward of the seaward boundary of state waters including certain facilities in coastal inland waters is a lesser amount million  the company currently has a number of offshore facilities located beyond state waters and  thus  is subject to the million financial responsibility requirement 
the amount of financial responsibility may be increased  to a maximum of million  if the mms determines that a greater amount is justified based on specific risks posed by the operations 
the company expects that financial responsibility could be established through insurance  guaranty  indemnity  surety bond  letter of credit  qualification as a self insurer or a combination thereof 
the company cannot predict the final form of any financial responsibility rule that may be adopted by the mms under opa  but in any event  the impact of the rule is not expected to be any more burdensome to the company than it will be to other similarly situated companies involved in oil and gas exploration and production 
the company currently satisfies similar requirements for its ocs leases under ocsla 
canada 
the oil and natural gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government 
it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect the operations of the company in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size 
in canada  producers of oil negotiate sales contracts directly with oil purchasers  with the result that the market determines the price of oil 
the price depends in part on oil quality  prices of competing fuels  distance to market and the value of refined products 
oil exports may be made pursuant to export contracts with terms not exceeding one year in the case of light crude  and not exceeding two years in the case of heavy crude  provided that an order approving any such export has been obtained from the national energy board neb 
any oil export to be made pursuant to a contract of longer duration requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the neb and the issue of such a license requires the approval of the canadian federal government 
in canada  the price of natural gas sold in interprovincial and international trade is determined by negotiation between buyers and sellers 
natural gas exported from canada is subject to regulation by the government of canada through the neb 
producers and exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with purchasers  provided that the export contracts must continue to meet certain criteria prescribed by the neb 
as is the case with oil  natural gas exports for a term of less than two years must be made pursuant to an neb order  or  in the case of exports for a longer duration  pursuant to an neb license and canadian federal government approval 
the provincial governments of alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve availability  transportation arrangements and market considerations 
on january  the north american free trade agreement nafta among the governments of canada  the united states and mexico became effective 
nafta carries forward most of the material energy terms contained in the canada us free trade agreement 
in the context of energy resources  canada continues to remain free to determine whether exports to the united states or mexico will be allowed provided that any export restrictions do not i reduce the proportion of energy resource exported relative to domestic use  ii impose an export price higher than the domestic price  and iii disrupt normal channels of supply 
all three countries are prohibited from imposing minimum export or import price requirements 
nafta contemplates clearer disciplines on regulators to ensure fair implementation of any regulatory changes and to minimize disruption of contractual arrangements  which is important for canadian natural gas exports 
in addition to federal regulation  each province has legislation and regulations which govern land tenure  royalties  production rates  environmental protection and other matters 
the royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production 
royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee 
crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production  and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices  well productivity  geographical location  field discovery date and the type or quality of the petroleum product produced 
from time to time the governments of canada  alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan have established incentive programs which have included royalty rate deductions  royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects 
in alberta  a producer of oil or natural gas is entitled to a credit against the royalties payable to the crown by virtue of the artc alberta royalty tax credit program 
the artc program is based on a price sensitive formula  and the artc rate varies between  at prices for oil below per cubic meter  and  at prices above per cubic meter 
the artc rate is applied to a maximum of  of alberta crown royalties payable for each producer or associated group of producers 
crown royalties on production from producing properties acquired from corporations claiming maximum entitlement to artc will generally not be eligible for artc 
the rate is established quarterly based on the average par price  as determined by the alberta department of energy for the previous quarterly period 
canadian forest is eligible for artc credits only on eligible properties acquired and wells drilled after the change of control 
oil and natural gas royalty holidays and reductions for specific wells reduce the amount of crown royalties paid by the company to the provincial governments 
the artc program provides a rebate on crown royalties paid in respect of eligible producing properties 
environmental matters 
extensive federal  state  provincial and local laws govern oil and natural gas operations regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply 
some laws  rules and regulations relating to protection of the environment may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering a person liable for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
other laws  rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist or even prohibit exploration or production activities in sensitive areas 
in addition  state laws often require some form of remedial action to prevent pollution from former operations  such as closure of inactive pits and plugging of abandoned wells 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability 
these laws  rules and regulations affect the operations of the company 
compliance with environmental requirements generally could have a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of forest and its subsidiaries 
the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on the company 
nevertheless  changes in environmental law have the potential to adversely affect the company s operations 
for instance  at least two separate courts have recently ruled that certain wastes associated with the production of crude oil may be classified as hazardous substances under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act commonly called superfund and thus the company could become subject to the burdensome cleanup and liability standards established under the federal superfund program if significant concentrations of such wastes were determined to be present at the company s properties or to have been produced as a result of the company s operations 
alternately  pending amendments to superfund presently under consideration by the us congress could relax many of the burdensome cleanup and liability standards established under the statute 
in canada  the oil and natural gas industry is currently subject to environmental regulation pursuant to provincial and federal legislation 
environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with certain oil and gas industry operations 
in addition  legislation requires that well and facility sites be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities 
a breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties 
environmental legislation in alberta has undergone a major revision and has been consolidated into the environmental protection and enhancement act 
under the new act  environmental standards and compliance for releases  clean up and reporting are stricter 
also  the range of enforcement actions available and the severity of penalties have been significantly increased 
these changes will have an incremental effect on the cost of conducting operations in alberta 
although the company maintains insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above  including insuring the costs of clean up operations  public liability and physical damage  there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future or that such insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase 
the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operations 
the company has established guidelines to be followed to comply with environmental laws  rules and regulations 
the company has designated a compliance officer whose responsibility is to monitor regulatory requirements and their impacts on the company and to implement appropriate compliance procedures 
the company also employs an environmental manager whose responsibilities include causing forest s operations to be carried out in accordance with applicable environmental guidelines and implementing adequate safety precautions 
although the company maintains pollution insurance against the costs of clean up operations  public liability and physical damage  there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future 
forward looking statements and risk factors certain of the statements set forth under item business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this form k  such as the statements regarding planned capital expenditures and the availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures are forward looking and are based upon the company s current belief as to the outcome and timing of such future events 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties that can affect the outcome and timing of such events  including many factors beyond the control of the company 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the matters described below 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  the company s actual results and plans for and beyond could differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
many of the factors which may affect the company s future operating performance and long term liquidity are beyond the company s control  including  but not limited to  oil and natural gas prices  governmental actions and taxes  the availability and attractiveness of properties for acquisition  the adequacy and attractiveness of financing and operational results 
the company is subject to the following risk factors 
availability of financing 
the company has historically addressed its long term liquidity needs through the issuance of debt and equity securities  when market conditions permit  and through the use of nonrecourse production based financing 
the company continues to examine alternative sources of long term capital  including bank borrowings or the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities of the company  the issuance of net profits interests  sales of non strategic properties  prospects and technical information  or joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  therefore  the company s ability to execute its operating strategy will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
replacement of reserves 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics and vary from the steep declines characteristic of gulf of mexico reservoirs  where the company has a significant portion of its production  to the relatively slow declines characteristic of long lived fields in other regions 
except to the extent the company acquires properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful development and exploration activities  or both  the proved reserves of the company will decline as reserves are produced 
the company s future natural gas and oil production is  therefore  highly dependent upon its level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive 
to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable  the company s ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand its asset base of oil and gas reserves would be impaired 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s future development  acquisition and exploration activities will result in additional proved reserves or that the company will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
volatility of natural gas prices 
the company s revenues  profitability and future rate of growth  if any  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and the ability of the company to discover or acquire proved reserves 
historically  the prices for oil and natural gas have been quite volatile 
the company anticipates that such markets will continue to be volatile over the next year 
the company is impacted more by natural gas prices than by oil prices  because the majority of its production is natural gas 
at december  of the company s estimated proved reserves consisted of natural gas on an mcfe basis 
during  of the company s total production consisted of natural gas 
the volatility of the spot market for natural gas is due to factors beyond the company s control  including seasonality of demand which may cause the price received for spot market natural gas to vary significantly between seasonal periods 
prices are also affected by actions of state and local agencies  the united states and foreign governments  and international cartels  all of which are beyond the company s control 
these external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to estimate future prices of oil and natural gas 
any substantial or extended decline in the price of oil or natural gas would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in order to attempt to minimize the product price volatility to which the company is subject  the company  from time to time  enters into energy swap agreements and other financial arrangements with third parties to attempt to reduce the company s short term exposure to fluctuations in future oil and natural gas prices 
long term contracts entered into by the netback pool and the volumetric production payment agreements that the company has entered into further minimize the price volatility to which the company is subject 
for further information concerning market conditions  long term contracts  production payments and energy swap agreements  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
ceiling limitation writedowns 
the company reports its operations using the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
the company capitalizes the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  the company is subject to a ceiling limitation writedown to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling limitation writedown is a charge to earnings which does not impact cash flow from operating activities 
however  such writedowns impact the amount of the company s shareholders equity 
the risk that the company will be required to write down the carrying value of its oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  writedowns may occur if the company has substantial downward revisions in its estimated proved reserves or if purchasers or governmental action cause an abrogation of  or the company voluntarily cancels  long term contracts for its natural gas 
although the company did not have a writedown in or  the company had a writedown of  in no assurance can be given that the company will not experience additional writedowns in the future 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
gas marketing 
the company s operations include gas marketing as a result of the canadian forest acquisition 
promark s gas marketing operations consist of the marketing of its own gas production  the purchase and direct sale of third parties natural gas  the handling of transportation and operations of such third party gas and spot purchasing and selling of natural gas 
the profitability of such natural gas marketing operations depends in large part on the ability of the company to assess and respond to changing market conditions  including credit risk 
profitability of such natural gas marketing operations also depends in large part on the ability of the company to maximize the volume of third party natural gas which the company purchases and resells and on the ability of the company to obtain a satisfactory margin between the purchase price and the sales price for such volumes 
the inability of the company to respond appropriately to changing conditions in the gas marketing business could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
gas processing 
as a result of the canadian forest acquisition  the company s operations include processing of natural gas to extract various natural gas liquids 
canadian forest s gas processing operations primarily consist of an interest in an ethane extraction plant located near edmonton  alberta 
in order to obtain from natural gas suppliers volumes of committed natural gas reserves to maintain natural gas throughput at optimal levels  the plant must periodically contract to process additional natural gas volumes provided from new or existing sources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in contracting additional natural gas to maintain optimal levels of throughput 
credit risk 
promark buys and sells gas in its trading operation for terms as short as one day and as long as one to two years 
profits generated by trading are derived from the spread between the prices of gas purchased and sold 
promark endeavors to offset its gas purchase or sales commitments with other gas purchase or sales contracts  thereby limiting its exposure to price risk 
the company is  however  exposed to credit risk in that there exists the possibility that the counterparties to agreements will fail to perform their contractual obligations 
currency risk 
following the acquisition of canadian forest in january  a substantial portion of the company s operations is located in canada 
the expenses of such operations are payable in canadian dollars and most of the revenue derived from natural gas and oil sales is based upon us dollar prices 
the results of such canadian operations will therefore be subject to the risks of fluctuation in the relative values of canadian and us dollars 
general risks of oil and gas operations 
the nature of the oil and gas business involves a variety of risks  including  but not limited to  the risks of operating hazards such as fires  explosions  cratering  blow outs  adverse weather conditions  pollution  environmental hazards such as oil spills  gas leaks  ruptures and discharges of toxic gases  encountering formations with abnormal pressures and  in horizontal wellbores  the increased risk of mechanical failure and collapsed holes  the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to the company 
the company conducts a substantial portion of its operations offshore in the gulf of mexico 
such operations are subject to certain risks including  but not limited to  capsizing  collision  sinking and grounding of rigs and vessels and adverse weather and sea conditions 
these risks could result in substantial losses to the company due to personal injury or loss of life  severe damage or destruction of property and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage clean up costs  regulatory investigation and penalties and the suspension of operations 
the company maintains insurance against some  but not all  of these risks in amounts that management believes to be reasonable and in accordance with customary oil and gas industry practices 
the occurrence of a significant event  however  that is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
the company competes with major and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and gas properties  as well as the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties 
the company also competes with major and independent oil and gas companies in the marketing and sale of oil and natural gas to marketers and end users 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those of the company 
drilling risks 
drilling involves numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered 
the cost of drilling and completing wells is often unpredictable  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  weather conditions and shortages or delays in delivery of equipment 
there can be no assurance as to the success of the company s future drilling activities 
the company s current inventory of d and d seismic surveys will not necessarily increase the likelihood that the company will drill or complete commercially productive wells or that the volumes of reserves discounted  if any  would necessarily be greater than the company would have discovered without its current inventory of seismic surveys 
acquisition risks 
the company s growth has been attributable in part to acquisitions of producing properties 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs  potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond the company s control 
such assessments are necessarily inexact and their accuracy inherently uncertain 
in connection with such an assessment  the company performs a review of the subject properties that it believes to be generally consistent with industry practices 
such a review  however  will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
inspections may not always be performed on every platform or well  and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
the company is generally not entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities  including environmental liabilities  and generally acquires interests in the properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties 
marketability of oil and gas production 
the marketability of the company s production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
us federal and state regulation and canadian regulation of oil and gas production and transportation  general economic conditions  and changes in supply and demand all could adversely affect the company s ability to produce and market its oil and natural gas 
if market factors were to change dramatically  the financial impact on the company could be substantial 
the availability of markets is beyond the control of the company and thus represents a significant risk 
seasonality of demand for natural gas 
demand for natural gas is highly seasonal  with demand generally higher in the colder winter months and in hot summer months 
to date  the company generally has been able to sell all of its available spot market natural gas at prevailing spot market prices  thus  the volumes sold by the company have not fluctuated materially with seasonality 
there is no assurance  however  that the company will be able to continue to achieve this result 
government regulation  environmental risks and taxes 
various aspects of the company s oil and natural gas operations are regulated by administrative agencies under statutory provisions of the states and provinces where such operations are conducted  by certain agencies of the federal government for operations on federal leases and by the canadian government 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which oil and natural gas could be sold 
while sales by producers of natural gas  and all sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
extensive us  state and local laws and canadian laws govern oil and gas operations regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply 
these laws  rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability 
these laws  rules and regulations affect the operations of the company 
compliance with environmental requirements generally could have a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of forest 
although forest s experience has been to the contrary  there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case 
item properties forest s principal reserves and producing properties are oil and gas properties located in the gulf of mexico  texas  oklahoma and alberta  canada 
reserves information regarding the company s proved and proved developed oil and gas reserves and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes therein is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
since january  forest has not filed any oil or natural gas reserve estimates or included any such estimates in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency  other than the securities and exchange commission sec  the mms and the department of energy doe

alberta s royalty program was restructured in and remained uncertain throughout much of and canadian production of natural gas liquids for the year ended december  was reduced by  barrels as a result of royalty adjustments  resulting in an increase in the reported average sales price for natural gas liquids in canada to per barrel from or by approximately 
the royalty adjustments did not have a significant effect on reported volumes or average sales prices for natural gas or oil and condensate 
canadian forest continues to receive additional information with respect to royalty calculations and anticipates that revisions to such calculations will continue to occur throughout the effects of future royalty adjustments cannot be predicted at this time 
production costs were converted to common units of measure using a conversion ratio of one barrel of oil to six mcf of natural gas and one long ton of sulfur to mcf of natural gas 
such production costs exclude all depreciation  depletion and provision for impairment associated with property and equipment

item legal proceedings royalty owners had filed two separate class action lawsuits against the company in the state district court of caddo county  oklahoma 
in each case the plaintiff alleged unjust enrichment  breach of fiduciary duty  constructive fraud and breach of contract 
the claims in both suits were based on the allegation that the company underpaid royalties on the consideration received pursuant to settlement agreements with oneok  inc in and modrall v 
forest oil corporation  case no 
cj  was filed on march   and the court  on september   certified a class comprised of the royalty and overriding royalty owners in the three wells involved in the oneok  inc settlement 
merco of oklahoma  inc 
v 
forest oil corporation  case no 
cj  was filed on september  this suit involves the oneok  inc settlement 
the plaintiffs in both suits sought actual damages in excess of  punitive damages in excess of  an accounting  interest and costs 
there had been no specific determination of the amount in controversy in either case 
the plaintiffs alleged in both cases that they were entitled to share in all value received by the company under the aforesaid settlements  including proceeds not attributable to actual gas production 
as a result of a ruling by the oklahoma supreme court in a case involving similar issues  both of these cases were dismissed without prejudice on september  the company entered into a settlement agreement and release with el paso natural gas company el paso  effective may   which was later modified by a partial termination of settlement agreement and release and gas purchase agreement  effective january  these agreements settled the parties disputes concerning take or pay deficiencies under eight gas purchase contracts covering wells located in washita county  oklahoma 
the company received a demand letter dated november  from the same attorney who represented modrall and merco  on behalf of a royalty owner in one of the wells covered by the el paso settlements 
a class action petition was filed january  in wright v 
forest oil corporation  et al  case no 
cj in the state district court of washita county  oklahoma 
like the plaintiffs in the modrall and merco cases  the plaintiff in this case contended that forest underpaid royalties on the consideration it received under the el paso settlement 
he asserted claims for breach of contract  unjust enrichment  breach of fiduciary duty  constructive fraud and bad faith breach of contract  and sought an accounting and an unspecified amount of actual and punitive damages  interest and costs 
this case was also dismissed without prejudice on september  for the same reasons as set forth above 
a petition for rehearing asking the oklahoma supreme court to reconsider its ruling in the related case was denied 
the company  in the ordinary course of business  is a party to various other legal actions

accounting policies 
the company changed its method of accounting for oil and gas sales from the sales method to the entitlements method effective january  under the sales method previously used by the company  all proceeds from production credited to the company were recorded as revenue until such time as the company had produced its share of related reserves 
under the entitlements method  revenue is recorded based upon the company s share of volumes sold  regardless of whether the company has taken its proportionate share of volumes produced 
under the entitlements method  the company records a receivable or payable to the extent it receives less or more than its proportionate share of the related revenue 
the company believes that the entitlements method is preferable because it allows for recognition of revenue based on the company s actual share of jointly owned production and provides a better matching of revenue and related expenses 
the cumulative effect of the change for the periods through december   was a charge of  the effect of this change on was an increase in earnings from operations of  and an increase in production volumes of  mcf

many of the factors which may affect the company s future operating performance and long term liquidity are beyond the company s control  including  but not limited to  oil and natural gas prices  governmental actions and taxes  the availability and attractiveness of properties for acquisition  the adequacy and attractiveness of financing and operational results 
the company continues to examine alternative sources of long term capital  including bank borrowings  the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities of the company  the issuance of net profits interests  sales of non strategic assets  prospects and technical information  or joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  therefore  the company s ability to execute its operating strategy will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
cash flow 
historically  one of the company s primary sources of capital has been net cash provided by operating activities operating cash flow 
the following summary table reflects comparative cash flow data for the company for the years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands net cash provided used by operating activities    net cash used by investing activities    net cash provided used by financing activities    net cash provided by operating activities increased to  in compared to a net use of cash for operating activities of  in  due to higher natural gas and liquids prices  increased natural gas and liquids production as a result of the saxon and canadian forest acquisitions and the contribution made by promark and an increase in accounts payable during the company used  for investing activities in compared to  in the increase is due primarily to the use of funds to acquire canadian forest and higher capital expenditures 
cash provided by financing activities was  in compared to  in the increase is due primarily to the net proceeds received from the public offering and the exercise by anschutz of options and warrants 
capital expenditures 
the company s expenditures for property acquisition  exploration and development for the past three years were as follows years ended december  in thousands property acquisition costs proved properties    undeveloped properties  exploration costs direct costs    overhead capitalized   development costs direct costs    overhead capitalized    amounts consist primarily of the allocation of purchase price to the oil and gas properties acquired in the purchase of canadian forest 
amounts consist primarily of the allocation of purchase price to the oil and gas properties acquired in the purchase of saxon 
the company s budgeted direct expenditures for exploration and development are approximately  and  respectively 
capitalized overhead in is expected to be approximately  the company expects to be able to meet its capital expenditure financing requirements using cash flows generated by operations  sales of non strategic assets and borrowings under existing lines of credit 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will have access to sufficient capital to meet its capital requirements 
the planned levels of capital expenditures could be reduced if the company experiences lower than anticipated net cash provided by operations or other liquidity needs or could be increased if the company experiences increased cash flow or accesses additional sources of capital 
the prices the company receives for its future oil and natural gas production will significantly impact future operating cash flows 
no prediction can be made as to the prices the company will receive for its future oil and gas production 
in addition  while the company intends to continue a strategy of acquiring reserves that meet its investment criteria  no assurance can be given that the company can locate or finance any property acquisitions 
pending acquisition on march  saxon announced an offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding class a shares of truax resources corporation truax 
truax shareholders may elect to receive either cdn or two saxon shares for each truax share tendered  subject to certain minimum and maximum aggregate amounts of saxon shares 
the value of the offer is approximately  cdn 
the offer expires april  and is subject to a minimum of two thirds of the outstanding class a shares of truax being tendered and the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals

canadian forest is obligated to deliver approximately of the volumes of natural gas subject to these contracts 
hedging program 
in addition to the volumes of natural gas and oil sold under long term sales contracts and dedicated to volumetric production payments  the company also uses energy swaps and other financial agreements to hedge against the effects of fluctuations in the sales prices for oil and natural gas produced 
in a typical swap agreement  the company receives the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon third party index if the index price is lower 
if the index price is higher  the company pays the difference 
the company s current swaps are settled on a monthly basis 
at december  the company had natural gas swaps and collars for an aggregate of approximately bbtu billion british thermal units per day of natural gas during at fixed prices ranging from per mmbtu million british thermal units on an alberta energy company c aeco c basis to per mmbtu on a new york mercantile exchange nymex basis and an aggregate of approximately bbtu per day of natural gas during at fixed prices ranging from aeco c basis to nymex basis per mmbtu 
the weighted average hedged price for natural gas under such agreements is and per mmbtu in and  respectively
