competition 
competition is intense in the markets in which the company sells its products 
the company competes with a large number of other companies  both domestic and foreign  several of which have diversified products lines  well known brands and financial  distribution and marketing resources substantially greater than those of the company 
the principal competitors for the company s saucony products are nike  new balance and asics 
the principal competitors for the company s brookfield products are variflex  roller derby  blade runner and fisher price 
dependence on foreign suppliers 
a number of manufacturers located in the far east  primarily in china  taiwan and thailand  supply products and product components to the company 
during fiscal  one of such suppliers  located in china  accounted for approximately of the company s total purchases by dollar volume 
the company is subject to the usual risks of a business involving foreign suppliers  such as currency fluctuations  government regulation of fund transfers  export and import duties  trade limitations imposed by the united states or foreign governments and political and labor instability 
in particular  there are a number of trade related and other issues creating significant friction between the governments of the united states and china  and the imposition of punitive import duties on certain categories of chinese products has been threatened in the past and may be implemented in the future 
in addition  the company has no long term manufacturing agreements with its foreign suppliers and competes with other athletic shoe and recreational product companies  including companies that are much larger than the company  for access to production facilities 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including the timing and shipment of individual orders  market acceptance of new athletic footwear or outdoor recreational products for children  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  mix of products sold  changes in product pricing and general economic conditions 
in addition  a substantial portion of the company s revenue is realized during the last few weeks of each quarter  therefore  any delays in orders or shipments are more likely to result in revenue not being recognized until the following quarter  which could adversely impact the results of operations for that quarter 
the company s current expense levels are based in part on its expectations of future revenue and  as a result  net income for a given period could be disproportionately affected by any reduction in revenue 
it is possible that in some future quarter the company s revenue or operating results will be below the expectations of stock market securities analysts and investors  if that were to occur  the market price of the common stock could be materially adversely affected 
management of growth 
one element of the company s business strategy is to seek acquisitions of businesses and products that are complementary to those of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effect any acquisitions  operate any such acquired businesses profitably or otherwise implement its growth strategy successfully 
in addition  identifying and effecting acquisitions and integrating the acquired businesses with the operations of the company may place significant demands upon the current management team and operational systems of the company 
in order to effect acquisitions of a certain size  the company may require additional capital  which the company may obtain through additional borrowings under its credit facility 
dependence upon licensing arrangements 
the company sells brookfield products under trade names licensed from other parties 
most of the company s licenses are non exclusive  have a fixed term and limit the types of products that may be sold under the license 
dependence on consumer preferences 
the company is susceptible to fluctuations in its business based upon fashion trends and frequently changing consumer style preferences and product demands  including levels of enthusiasm for athletic activities 
the company believes that its success depends in substantial part on its ability to anticipate  gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner 
moreover  the company could be materially adversely affected by conditions in the retail industry in general  including consolidation and the resulting decline in the number of retailers and other cyclical economic factors 
advertising and marketing programs 
the company s success in the markets in which it competes depends in part upon the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs of the company 
in particular  the company must periodically design and successfully execute new and effective advertising and marketing programs 
dependence on major customers 
although the company had no customer that accounted for ten percent or more of the company s consolidated revenue during  the company s business is susceptible to the loss of certain key customers of the company s product lines  such as foot locker for the company s saucony products and toys r us for the company s brookfield products
