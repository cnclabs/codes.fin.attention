in december  the acc adopted rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona in phases from through the rules establish a framework for introducing competition  however  with respect to certain matters  they also contain requirements for further workshops and acc consideration prior to implementation 
recommendations to the acc from the workshops are expected in late the rules indicate that the acc will allow recovery of unmitigated stranded costs  but do not set forth the mechanisms for determining or recovering such costs
