the laser operation was sold in october consequently  the results of operations of also have been reported as a discontinued business in the accompanying financial statements and in the discussion below 
the company acquired src  pulsarr and ventek in february  march and july  respectively 
the operations of the acquired entities are included in the financial statements from their respective acquisition dates

selling and marketing expenses amounted to of sales in similar expenses in were  or of sales 
research and development expenses were  and  in and  or and of sales  respectively 
the larger research and development level in was due principally to the continuing development of src s advanced vision processor and projects in non food industry sorting applications and  for pulsarr and ventek 
general and administrative expenses increased  to  in from  in the increase in general and administrative expenses is due to the addition of pulsarr and ventek as well as an increase in personnel costs and legal fees at src and arc 
the increase in goodwill amortization is due to the acquisitions of pulsarr and ventek 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  on march   the company acquired pulsarr for approximately million 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process technology  which was charged to expense during the quarter ended march  this charge is not deductible for tax purposes 
the company will need to invest in additional development related to the in process technology in order to make these technologies commercially viable 
these expenditures are expected to be paid out over the next few years and will be funded primarily from cash generated from operations 
in the first quarter of  the company wrote off  of deferred royalty expenses relating to certain technologies  as all royalties have been earned and the company believes that no significant future economic life exists relating to the royalty agreement  as the result of changing technologies

a gain of  was recorded in february relating to the shares recovered 
the increase in interest expense is due to the increase in debt outstanding relating to the acquisitions of pulsarr and ventek 
the net loss for was  as compared to net income of  in the variation is due primarily to the non recurring charges for in process technology and royalty expense  the increased level of research and development expenses  and the non recurring gain in relating to the shares of arc common stock returned pursuant to an arbitration award

sales for increased or  to  as compared to sales of non food machine vision systems increased or  to  total machine vision systems sold in were as compared to systems in cost of sales was of sales in and in the decrease is primarily due to a spreading of fixed manufacturing costs over a larger sales base and better margins on sales of non food industry systems 
cost of sales in also included restructuring charges of  gross profit increased by  to of sales in as compared to of sales in as a result of the factors discussed above 
selling and marketing expenses increased  or from to as a percentage of sales  such expenses were in and in the decrease is due to the spreading of fixed costs over a larger sales base and a relatively larger trade show expense in when compared to sales

during  acquisition related and restructuring costs amounted to  general and administrative expenses were in as compared to in in  general and administrative expenses were spread over a larger sales base 
goodwill expense increased  in because of one extra month of amortization in that period 
goodwill amortization began in february income from continuing operations before other income and expense in was  compared to a loss of  in due to the above reasons 
in february  liviakis financial communications  inc returned approximately  previously issued and outstanding shares of arc class a common stock pursuant to an award in arbitration in favor of the company

the loss from discontinued operations declined to  in from  in the loss included restructuring charges of  the remaining decrease in the loss from discontinued operations was primarily a result of cost reductions implemented in the september restructuring 
net income for was  as compared to a loss of  for  a positive change of  liquidity and capital resources in march  in conjunction with the acquisition of pulsarr  the company received  from the sale of  shares of class a common stock pursuant to a private placement 
in april  the company received  representing the net proceeds of a private placement of a convertible debt 
in october  the company received approximately  from the sale of its laser diode operations 
in april  the company received  representing the net proceeds from a private placement of convertible debt 
the cash generated from these transactions was used to finance the acquisition of pulsarr and to provide funds for working capital purposes 
the company s principal sources of operating capital have been funds from the above transactions  its overseas regulation s offerings in september and october and in and its initial public offering in march as of december   the company had  in working capital 
as a result of the settlement in july of a lawsuit alleging certain patent infringements  src entered into a royalty agreement  pursuant to which src agreed to pay royalties of of certain vision system sales through the earlier of june   and the date at which aggregate royalty payments equal  until aggregate royalty payments equal  maximum annual royalty payments were  through the final  installment was paid on june  during the quarter ended march   the company wrote off against income  of deferred royalty expense related to the settlement as all royalties had been earned and no significant future economic life is estimated to exist 
the company intends to continue to market its vision systems technology and products  and will evaluate selected acquisition opportunities 
additional investments will be required for capital equipment  marketing and research and development for the company to remain competitive 
for example  funds must be expended to complete development of the company s next generation of processor to enhance the company s ability to effectively compete in certain markets with key technology inc s the company s principal competitor product introduction 
furthermore  if the company consummates additional technology intensive acquisitions  additional equipment and r d investments may be necessary  perhaps to a greater extent than for the company s existing operations 
the company s also operation  arc s only business prior to the february acquisition of src  had suffered losses since inception 
also was sold in october in  src generated operating profits before allocation of corporate overhead expenses 
even though src reached operating profitability in four of the last six quarters and had a history of profitable operations prior to its acquisition by arc  there can be no assurance that long term profitability will be realized 
pulsarr operated profitably from through  but at a small loss in due to the push down of acquisition related costs  including interest on acquisition debt 
ventek has operated profitably since the company operates in a highly competitive environment  and delays and difficulties relating to technological changes and turnaround situations often occur  any of which would materially and adversely affect the company s cash flow 
furthermore  operational and marketing difficulties may occur relating to the integration of the recently completed acquisitions of pulsarr and ventek 
the acquisition of pulsarr occurred on march  in connection therewith  the company has paid approximately million to the sellers 
cash received from the march and april placements of stock and notes detailed above generated approximately  the balance of the cash payments of approximately  was paid from the company s current cash balances 
the acquisition of ventek occurred in july consideration for the transaction was approximately million in notes and other securities as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
prior to  the company had a history of negative operating cash flow 
the company believes it will operate at a negative cash flow during certain periods in the future due to payment of notes issued in connection with prior financings  working capital requirements  the need to fund certain development projects  cash required to enter new market areas  and possible cash needed to fully integrate pulsarr s and ventek s operations 
to fulfill its operational goals and to repay approximately million in debt due in april  the company will require approximately million of additional financing 
other than this financing need  management believes that the company has sufficient cash to enable the company to sustain its operations and to adequately fund the cash flow expected to be used in operating activities for the next twelve months 
until the company is able to consistently generate sustained positive cash flow from operations  the company must rely on debt or equity financing 
in january  the company sued credit suisse to fulfill its obligation to fund million pursuant to a subscription agreement dated may  there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in this suit although the company believes it has a contractual right to the funding 
in connection with the acquisition of pulsarr  the company wrote off approximately million of acquired in process technology in the first quarter of this non recurring charge contributed to a substantial reported loss in  even though sales for  including pulsarr and ventek from their respective acquisition dates  increased from levels 
the company is seeking additional financing  however  there can be no assurance the company will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms satisfactory to the company  if at all 
the recent increases in i outstanding shares of the company s class a common stock due to private placements and the restricted stock plan  ii the april and april private placements of convertible debt  iii notes issued in connection with the acquisition of ventek  iv a substantial loss in  and v the number of securities issuable upon exercise of warrants and convertible debt may limit the company s ability to negotiate additional debt or equity financing 
other information arc did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures at december  cash flow summary years ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities    net cash provided by used in investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities    net increase decrease in cash    this information was derived from the consolidated statements of cash flows which are part of the company s financial statements 
other than for fiscal  in each of the fiscal periods set forth in the cash flow summary above  net losses driven by special charges in and minimal revenues in were responsible for the significant cash flow deficits from operating activities 
furthermore  in significant amounts were expended in pursuit of the company s acquisition strategy  including the acquisition of src 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever sustain long term profitability  which could result in cash flow deficits 
historically  the company has financed its cash flow deficits by borrowings and sales of securities  principally with the net proceeds of its regulation s offerings 
inflation the company has not been materially affected by general inflation 
cautionary statements and risk factors the company may  from time to time  make forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
factors associated with the forward looking statements which could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated appear below 
readers should carefully consider the following cautionary statements and risk factors 
history of losses  negative cash flow other than in  the company has had a history of losses and negative operating cash flow 
the company believes it may operate at a negative cash flow in the future due to i the need to fund certain development projects  ii cash required to enter new market areas  iii interest costs associated with recent financings  iv cash required for the repayment of debt  especially million due in april  and v possible cash needed to fully integrate pulsarr s and ventek s operations 
until the company is able to consistently generate sustained positive cash flow from operations  the company must rely on debt or equity financing 
although the company achieved profitability in  there can be no assurance as to the company s profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
furthermore  the non recurring expenses in early resulted in a significant loss for the year 
need for additional financing the company is seeking additional financing  however  there can be no assurance the company will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms satisfactory to the company  if at all 
the recent increases in i outstanding shares of the company s class a common stock due to private placements and implementation of the restricted stock plan  ii the april and april private placements of convertible debt  iii a substantial loss in  iv debt incurred for the acquisition of ventek  and v the number of securities issuable upon exercise of warrants and convertible debt may limit the company s ability to negotiate additional debt or equity financing 
uncertain ability to manage growth and integrate acquired businesses as part of its business strategy  the company intends to pursue rapid growth 
in march and july  the company acquired pulsarr and ventek  respectively  which had sales in of approximately million and million  respectively  and would have added approximately to the company s sales on a proforma basis 
this growth strategy will require the integration of new entities  such as pulsarr and ventek  the establishment of distribution relationships in foreign countries  expanded customer service and support  increased personnel throughout the company and the continued implementation and improvement of the company s operational  financial and management information systems 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to attract qualified personnel or to accomplish other measures necessary for its successful integration of pulsarr  ventek or other acquired entities or for internal growth  or that the company can successfully manage expanded operations 
as the company expands  it may from time to time experience constraints that will adversely affect its ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion 
failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
rapid technological change  product development the markets for the company s machine vision products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
for example  the company believes that the introduction by key technology  inc of its new line of vision sorting equipment adversely affected bookings in late and sales of products such as those offered by the company depend in part on the continuing development and deployment of emerging technology and new services and applications based on such technology 
the company s success will depend to a significant extent upon its ability to enhance its existing products and develop new products that gain market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selecting  developing and manufacturing new products or enhancing its existing products on a timely or cost effective basis or that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products noncompetitive or obsolete 
moreover  the company may encounter technical problems in connection with its product development that could result in the delayed introduction of new products or product enhancements 
failure to develop or introduce on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance would materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
market acceptance of new products the company s future operating results will depend upon its ability to successfully introduce and market  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and enhancements to existing products 
there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements  if developed and manufactured  will achieve market acceptance 
the company is currently in the initial prototype stage of development on a new high speed software and digital signal processing technology designed to significantly improve system performance 
there can be no assurance that a market for this system will develop ie  that a need for the system will exist  that the system will be favored over other products on the market  etc 
or  if a market does develop  that the company will be able  financially or operationally  to market and support the system successfully 
dependence on certain markets and expansion into new markets the future success and growth of the company is dependent upon continuing sales in domestic and international food processing market as well as successful penetration of other existing and potential markets 
a substantial portion of the company s historical sales has been in the potato and vegetable processing markets 
reductions in capital equipment expenditures by such processors due to commodity surpluses  product price fluctuations  changing consumer preferences or other factors could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company also intends to expand the marketing of its processing systems in additional food markets such as meat and granular food products  as well as nonfood markets such as plastics  wood products and tobacco  and to expand its sales activities in foreign markets 
in the case of ventek  the wood products market served is narrow  and saturation of that market and the potential inability to identify and develop new markets could adversely affect ventek s growth rate 
there can be no assurance that the company can successfully penetrate additional food and non food markets or expand further in foreign markets 
lengthy sales cycle the sales cycle in the marketing and sale of the company s machine vision systems  especially in new markets or in a new application  is lengthy and can be as long as three years 
even in existing markets  due to the  to  price range for each system  the purchase of a machine vision system can constitute a substantial capital investment for a customer which may need more than one machine for its particular proposed application requiring lengthy consideration and evaluation 
in particular  a potential customer must develop a high degree of assurance that the product will meet its needs  successfully interface with the customer s own manufacturing  production or processing system  and have minimal warranty  safety and service problems 
accordingly  the time lag from initiation of marketing efforts to final sales can be lengthy 
competition the markets for the company s products are highly competitive 
a major competitor of the company has recently made a new product introduction which has increased the competition that the company faces 
some of the company s competitors may have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company 
important competitive factors in the company s markets include price  performance  reliability  customer support and service 
although the company believes that it currently competes effectively with respect to these factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete effectively in the future 
dependence upon certain suppliers certain key components and subassemblies used in the company s products are currently obtained from sole sources or a limited group of suppliers  and the company does not have any long term supply agreements to ensure an uninterrupted supply of these components 
although the company seeks to reduce dependence on sole or limited source suppliers  the inability to obtain sufficient sole or limited source components as required  or to develop alternative sources if and as required  could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations and damage customer relationships 
the purchase of certain of the components used in the company s products require an to week lead time for delivery 
an unanticipated shortage of such components could delay the company s ability to timely manufacture units  damage customer relations  and have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components or subassemblies could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
dependence upon significant customers and distribution channel the company sold equipment to two unaffiliated customers totaling and of sales in and to two customers totaling and of sales in sales to another unaffiliated customer totaled of sales in ventek s sales have been to a relatively small number of multi location plywood manufacturers 
the company usually receives orders of from one to several machine vision systems  but occasionally receives larger orders 
while the company strives to create long term relationships with its customers and distributors  there can be no assurance that they will continue ordering additional systems from the company 
the company may continue to be dependent on a small number of customers and distributors  the loss of which would adversely affect the company s business 
risk of international sales due to its export sales from the us in the case of src and ventek  or from the netherlands in the case of pulsarr  the company is subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar or dutch guilder  which could increase the sales prices in local currencies of the company s products in international markets  delays in obtaining export licenses  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and the burdens of complying with a variety of international laws 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states or the netherlands 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results  seasonality the company has experienced and may in the future experience significant fluctuations in revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside the control of the company 
these factors include the timing of significant orders and shipments  product mix  delays in shipment  capital spending patterns of customers  competition and pricing  new product introductions by the company or its competitors  the timing of research and development expenditures  expansion of marketing and support operations  changes in material costs  production or quality problems  currency fluctuations  disruptions in sources of supply  regulatory changes and general economic conditions 
these factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
moreover  due to the relatively fixed nature of many of the company s costs  including personnel and facilities costs  the company would not be able to reduce costs in any quarter to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in net sales  and such a shortfall would have a proportionately greater impact on the company s results of operations for that quarter 
for example  a significant portion of the company s quarterly net sales depends upon sales of a relatively small number of high priced systems 
thus  changes in the number of such high priced systems shipped in any given quarter can produce substantial fluctuations in net sales  gross profits  and net income from quarter to quarter 
in addition  in the event the company s machine vision systems average selling price increases  of which there can be no assurance  the addition or cancellation of sales may exacerbate quarterly fluctuations in revenues and operating results 
the company s operating results may also be affected by certain seasonal trends 
the company typically experiences lower sales and order levels in the first quarter when compared with the preceding fourth quarter due primarily to the seasonality of certain harvested food items 
the company expects these seasonal patterns to continue  though their impact on revenues will decline as the company continues to expand its presence in nonagricultural and other markets which are less seasonal 
risks associated with possible acquisitions the company may pursue strategic acquisitions or joint ventures in addition to the acquisitions of pulsarr and ventek as part of its growth strategy 
while the company has no understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any further acquisition  the company anticipates that one or more potential opportunities may become available in the future 
acquisitions and joint ventures would require investment of operational and financial resources and could require integration of dissimilar operations  assimilation of new employees  diversion of management resources  increases in administrative costs and additional costs associated with debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that any acquisition or joint venture by the company will not have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations or will not result in dilution to existing shareholders 
if additional attractive opportunities become available  the company may decide to pursue them actively 
there can be no assurance that the company will complete any future acquisitions or joint ventures or that such a future transaction will not materially and adversely affect the company 
dependence upon key personnel the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the continuing contributions of its key management  technical  sales and marketing and other key personnel 
except for william j 
young  the company s president and chief executive officer  alan r 
steel  the company s chief financial officer  dr 
james ewan  src s president and chief executive officer  jan c 
scholt  pulsarr s managing director  and the four former stockholders of ventek  the company does not have long term employment agreements or other arrangements with such individuals which would encourage them to remain with the company 
the company s future success also depends upon its ability to attract and retain additional skilled personnel 
competition for such employees is intense 
the loss of any current key employees or the inability to attract and retain additional key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its existing personnel or attract such additional skilled employees in the future 
intellectual property the company s competitive position may be affected by its ability to protect its proprietary technology 
although the company has a number of united states and foreign patents  there can be no assurance that any such patents will provide meaningful protection for its product innovations 
the company may experience additional intellectual property risks in international markets where it may lack patent protection 
product liability and other legal claims from time to time  the company may be involved in litigation arising out of the normal course of its business  including product liability and other legal claims 
while the company has a general liability insurance policy which includes product liability coverage up to an aggregate amount of million  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential claims in the future 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company  that any such assertion of infringement will not result in litigation or that the company would prevail in such litigation 
furthermore  litigation  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by the company 
any infringement claims or litigation against the company could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
if a substantial product liability or other legal claim against the company were sustained that was not covered by insurance  there could be an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and marketability of the affected products 
warranty exposure and performance specifications the company generally provides a one year limited warranty on its products 
in addition  for certain custom designed systems  the company contracts to meet certain performance specifications for a specific application 
in the past  the company has incurred higher warranty expenses related to new products than it typically incurs with established products 
for example  pulsarr has sold several water jet cutting machines  a technology that has yet to be proven commercially viable  which have required redesign and warranty type expenditures over the past several years 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur substantial warranty expenses in the future with respect to new products  as well as established products  or with respect to its obligations to meet performance specifications  which may have an adverse effect on its results of operations and customer relationships
