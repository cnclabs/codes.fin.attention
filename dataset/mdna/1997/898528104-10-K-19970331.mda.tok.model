see factors which may impact results 
results of operations revenues for were  a decrease from levels 
the decrease is due primarily to the fact that shipments of et based products  which commenced in volume in the second quarter of  were not sufficient to offset lower shipments and selling prices of the company s second generation accelerator products as these products reached maturation in a rapidly evolving personal computer market 
sales volumes and selling prices of the company s et chip were adversely affected during by both high solution costs for et based solutions as the et was designed primarily for use with mdram and mdram prices did not keep pace with more industry standard edo memory prices and the market transition at the high end of the graphics market to first generation d graphic accelerators which accelerated in the fourth quarter of the company expects operating losses to continue until the company is successful in developing and introducing a d graphics product which receives market acceptance 
while the company is currently attempting to complete development of its first d graphics chip  because of the risks involved in bringing new technologies to market  in the production process of custom integrated circuits  and the competitive nature of the graphics market as a whole  there can be no assurance that revenues and earnings from this product will be sufficient to return the company to profitability 
revenues for were  a decrease from levels 
the decrease in revenues was due primarily to significantly lower shipments of the company s wi based products as these products reached maturation in a rapidly evolving personal computer marketplace 
sales of wi based products to one customer accounted for of revenues in this entity discontinued its wi based computer systems in the first quarter of higher sales of wp based products were not sufficient to offset lower unit shipments of the wi and lower selling prices on all of the company s graphics accelerator products 
the company introduced the first product of its third generation graphics and multimedia family  the et  at comdex in november this product was not in volume production in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was in  in and in the increase in cost of sales in is due both to pricing pressures on the et due to the high solution cost of et based solutions as mdram price reductions did not keep pace with edo memory price reductions in and a one time charge of  for reserves for d graphics inventory and purchase commitments related to the company s decision in the fourth quarter of to focus on the development of d graphics products 
the increase in cost of sales in is due to the fact that the impact of cost reduction programs on the wi and wp graphics accelerator products was not sufficient to offset lower selling prices on all of the company s products 
also contributing to the increase in was a one time reserve of  recorded by the company in the fourth quarter related to establishing a reserve for certain of its older technology based inventory 
in the future  the company s gross margin percentages may be affected by factors including but not limited to increased competition and related decreases in unit average selling price particularly with respect to mature products  timing of volume shipments of new products  the introduction of new products by competitors  the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers and changes in the mix of products sold and customers 
research and development expense in was  a increase from the  incurred in the increase was due to additional personnel and consulting costs to support the development of its third generation graphics products  including completion of the et and development of the company s first d graphics accelerator as well as a one time charge of  related to the write off of investments and commitments in technologies related primarily to d graphics and related multimedia products 
the company anticipates that it will continue to incur significant research and development expenditures as it continues to develop products to address the very competitive graphics market 
research and development expense in was  a increase from the increase was due primarily to increased personnel and outside consulting costs to support the development of the et product line  and due to the pursuit of new opportunities to expand the company s product line to address multimedia applications 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  and of revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in both and is due to lower revenue levels between periods  increased investments in personnel to enhance the company s operations  marketing and sales efforts  and the fixed nature of certain of the company s operating expenses 
one time charges of  related primarily to the write down of an investment in a multimedia company and the company s focus on d graphics also contributed to the increase in in addition  legal costs associated with the successful defense class action lawsuit referred to in note of the consolidated financial statements contributed to the increase in both and the company s effective income tax rate was a benefit of in compared to expenses of and in and  respectively 
the primary reason for the decreases in and is lower pretax income in each period 
also contributing to the decrease in was research and development credits represented a higher percentage of pretax income 
inflation is not expected to have an adverse significant impact on the company s operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s ability to generate cash adequate to meet its requirements results primarily from cash on hand  operating cash flow and the availability of bank borrowing

total working capital was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the company s cash and short term investments decreased to  at december from  at december  the decrease in cash is due primarily to cash used to fund operations  to purchase capital equipment to upgrade research and development capabilities and the advance to the manufacturer of mdram discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company also has a bank line of credit providing total availability of  there were no borrowings on this line in or the company had capital expenditures of approximately  during  related primarily to the purchase of equipment and software utilized in the company s research and development activities 
the company expects its existing sources of liquidity to be sufficient to fund its working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
in order to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  the company has considered and will continue to consider various possible transactions  including the use of take or pay contracts which commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over specified periods or the use of standby letters of credit to secure future capacity on a take or pay basis 
in addition  a number of the company s competitors have entered into various transactions to secure wafer capacity including equity investments in or advances to wafer foundries in exchange for guaranteed production  or the formation of joint ventures to own  construct or operate a wafer fabrication facility 
the company  to date  has not participated in advance funding or joint ventures and will continue to work to secure adequate capacity without such arrangements 
should the company be required to enter into any of the above manufacturing arrangements to secure foundry capacity  such arrangements may require substantial capital investment  which may require the company to seek additional equity or debt financing  and there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
in addition  the company may  from time to time  as business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire businesses  technologies or products that complement the business of the company 
no such investments or acquisitions are being negotiated as of the date of this form k
