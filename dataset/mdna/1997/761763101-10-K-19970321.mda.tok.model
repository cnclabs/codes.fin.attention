item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  related notes and other sections of this report 
in the tables  dollars are in millions  except per share and per pound amounts  and shipments are in thousands of metric tons 
a metric ton is equivalent to  pounds 
management s discussion and analysis contains forecasts  projections  estimates  statements of management s plans and objectives for the company and other forward looking statements 
please refer to the risk factors section beginning on page  where we have summarized factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in a forward looking statement or affect the extent to which a particular projection is realized 
results of operations the company s results in were adversely affected by lower realized prices for primary aluminum approximately lower than  as well as price declines for a number of our fabricated aluminum products 
the results reflect softness in the overall global aluminum market  primarily attributable to slower economic growth that has caused end users to liquidate excess inventories 
other factors affecting results include higher costs for certain raw materials  reduced shipping and manufacturing levels in the can and can sheet businesses due to weaker demand  and severe winter weather conditions early in the year that resulted in facility curtailments and lower volumes 
net income special items included in net income lifo inventory liquidations see note operational restructuring costs see note cumulative effect of accounting change see note gains on sales of assets see note earnings per share special items included in earnings per share lifo inventory liquidations operational restructuring costs cumulative effect of accounting change gains on sales of assets aluminum industry the aluminum industry entered facing carryover effects of the prior year and weakness in key economies 
the aluminum industry had a strong performance in  particularly in the first half of the year  because of improved aluminum supply demand fundamentals 
prices for both primary and fabricated aluminum products improved significantly 
industry shipments increased in late and early  largely as a result of hedge buying by end users who were anticipating price increases 
this created a customer inventory buildup  which resulted in lower shipments in the latter part of and in as end users reduced their excess inventories 
demand for aluminum products was further weakened by the soft landing of the us economy and weakness in european and other aluminum industry continued economies in late and in addition  higher worldwide production and higher exports from russia affected aluminum industry fundamentals in shipments and net sales net net net shipments sales shipments sales shipments sales finished products and other sales packaging and containers aluminum    nonaluminum other aluminum other nonaluminum production and processing primary aluminum sheet and plate    extrusions other aluminum other nonaluminum total       average realized price per pound fabricated aluminum products primary aluminum finished products and other sales aluminum packaging and container shipments decreased in due to lower can shipments 
can shipments decreased because of reduced beer can volumes and lower export sales to latin america as our partially owned can operations there added capacity 
we realized higher shipments of laminated aluminum foil in as a result of acquiring a laminated aluminum products plant in mid higher aluminum packaging and container shipments in resulted primarily from our acquisition of a can operation in mid shipments of other aluminum products were relatively flat in after increasing in severe winter weather conditions in early adversely affected our distribution and construction products businesses 
lower activity in the transportation market  especially for trucks and trailers  also negatively affected our distribution business 
both of these businesses continually strengthened during the year as weather and business conditions improved 
other aluminum shipments increased in due to our acquisition of a metals distribution company in the third quarter of net sales were slightly higher in  with higher nonaluminum sales offsetting the effect of lower aluminum shipments 
nonaluminum sales increased for a broad range of products including plastic packaging  printing cylinders  construction products and can machinery 
the effect of slightly higher prices for cans was offset by lower prices for aluminum distribution products 
higher net sales in as compared to reflected higher aluminum shipments  higher nonaluminum sales principally stainless steel and improved prices for aluminum products 
production and processing primary aluminum shipments fluctuate from year to year because of variations in internal requirements and changes in customer demand for value added foundry ingot and billet 
our acquisition of an additional interest in a canadian primary aluminum plant contributed to the higher shipments in and sheet and plate shipments decreased in due mainly to lower demand for can sheet 
can sheet shipments in were higher because of strong demand and higher shipments to the latin american operations 
the increase in can sheet shipments in was more than offset by a decrease in shipments of other sheet products resulting from a conversion of a portion of the other sheet business to tolling 
the increase in other aluminum shipments in reflected strong demand for deoxidization products used in the steel industry 
wheel shipments were up sharply in both years due to strong demand and the additional capacity in at our new plant in wisconsin 
year to year changes in net sales primarily reflect changes in demand for aluminum products over the past two years as explained earlier under aluminum industry 
the increases in nonaluminum sales in both years resulted from strong demand for alumina and carbon products  although the alumina market slowed later in operating profit finished products and other sales production and processing operating results generally reflect the contrast in the aluminum industry during the past two years 
lower aluminum prices  weaker volumes and lower capacity utilization in fabricating operations affected results 
generally  the opposite was true for with higher prices and volumes 
the year was also impacted by lower shipping levels in our can and can sheet businesses  higher labor costs as discussed below  the favorable effects of lifo liquidations and benefits from a reduction in primary aluminum purchases due to our purchase of an additional interest in a canadian primary aluminum plant 
both years also were affected by higher costs for materials used to produce alumina and the favorable effects of continuous improvement efforts 
selling  administrative and general expenses increased in primarily due to the higher level of business activity 
results for all three periods were negatively affected by unused capacity at our primary aluminum plants 
us production capacity of  metric tons remains temporarily curtailed 
in response to strong demand in the alumina market in  we returned our texas alumina refinery to full production 
in  because of slowing market conditions  we temporarily curtailed of the capacity at this refinery 
we do not expect this temporary curtailment to have a material impact on future operating results or affect our ability to meet the requirements of our primary aluminum operations 
in  we entered into new six year labor contracts with the unions that represent a majority of our domestic hourly employees 
major provisions of the new agreements include wage increases of an hour over the first five years plus incremental increases in and and enhanced pension operating profit continued and other benefits 
at the end of the fifth year  the economic provisions of the contracts will be reopened 
if agreement cannot be reached  the economic provisions will be submitted to arbitration for one additional year 
the company and the unions also agreed to work cooperatively on customer requirements  business objectives and shareholder and union interests 
in addition  the agreements contain broad  new provisions for employee safety  job security and employee participation in the work environment 
in  we closed a can plant in texas 
operational restructuring costs of million pre tax were recognized 
these costs related principally to employee termination costs at the texas plant see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  we closed a can plant in new york 
costs of million were recognized in for the closing of the new york plant and for asset revaluations at certain foreign entities 
this amount was offset by the reversal of existing reserves in resulting from changes in estimated requirements for previously restructured operations 
our current strategy for the us can business is to aggressively reduce costs and increase production efficiencies through modernization programs and new technologies 
geographic area analysis the company has operations in the us  canada and other foreign areas including europe  latin america and australia 
certain of these operations  especially in latin america  consist of equity interests  whose sales are not included in our consolidated net sales 
we also participate in an unincorporated joint venture that mines bauxite and produces alumina in australia 
year to year changes in net sales and operating profits in our three geographic areas domestic  canada and other foreign primarily reflect the previously discussed changes in aluminum industry fundamentals 
interest expense interest expense declined in because of lower effective interest rates and higher amounts of capitalized interest 
these benefits were partially offset by an increase in the amount of debt outstanding 
interest expense increased in due to higher rates 
we use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations after considering market conditions and levels of variable rate and fixed rate debt outstanding see note 
our strategy is to provide for lower interest expense during economic downturns  with the potential for higher interest expense during periods of economic growth 
taxes on income the company pays us federal  state and foreign taxes based on the laws of the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
the effective tax rates reflected in the income statement differ from the us federal statutory rate principally because of foreign taxes at different rates  the effects of percentage depletion allowances and  in  the effect of a non recurring foreign tax benefit 
a reconciliation of the effective rates is included in note taxes on income continued the company has worldwide operations in many tax jurisdictions that generate deferred tax assets and or liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities have been netted by jurisdiction  resulting in both a deferred tax asset and a deferred tax liability on the balance sheet 
at december   we had million of deferred tax assets that relate primarily to us tax positions 
the most significant portions of these assets relate to tax carryforward benefits and accrued costs for employee health care  environmental and restructuring costs 
a major portion of these assets will be realized in the future through the reversal of temporary differences  principally depreciation 
to the extent that these assets are not covered by reversals of depreciation  we expect the remainder to be realized through us income earned in future periods 
the company has a strong history of sustainable earnings 
however  even without considering projections of income  certain tax planning strategies  such as changing the method of valuing inventories from lifo to fifo and or entering into sale leaseback transactions  would generate sufficient taxable income to realize the portion of the deferred tax asset related to us operations 
in addition  we can indefinitely carry forward the majority of our us tax carryforward benefits 
based on our evaluation of these matters  we expect that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we are not aware of any events or uncertainties that could significantly affect our conclusions regarding realization 
we reassess the realization of deferred tax assets quarterly and  if necessary  adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
environmental the company is involved in remedial investigations and actions at various locations  including environmental protection agency superfund sites where we and  in most cases  others have been designated as potentially responsible parties prps 
we accrue remediation costs when it becomes probable that such efforts will be required and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
we evaluate the status of all significant existing or potential environmental issues quarterly  develop or revise cost estimates to satisfy known remediation requirements  and adjust the accrual accordingly 
at december   the accrual was million million at december  
the accrual reflects our best estimate of the ultimate liability for known remediation costs 
in estimating anticipated costs  we consider the extent of our involvement at each site  joint and several liability provisions under applicable law  and the likelihood of obtaining contributions from other prps 
potential insurance recoveries are uncertain and therefore have not been considered 
based on information currently available  we expect to make remediation expenditures relating to costs currently accrued over the next to years with the majority spent by the year we expect cash flows from operations to provide the funds for environmental capital  operating and remediation expenditures 
annual capital expenditures for equipment designed for environmental control purposes averaged approximately million over the past three years 
ongoing environmental operating costs for the same period averaged approximately million per year 
we estimate that operating expenditures for through will remain at approximately these same levels 
we estimate that annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities will be approximately million in  million in and million in the majority of these expenditures are for the capital spending program referred to below at our primary aluminum plant in new york 
environmental continued our spending on environmental compliance will be influenced by future environmental regulations  including those issued and to be issued under the clean air act amendments of we have begun a five year capital spending program of an estimated million at our primary aluminum plant in new york 
the project includes new air emissions controls and a phased modernization of the plant s production lines 
we are accelerating certain expenditures believed necessary to achieve compliance with the clean air act s proposed maximum achievable control technology standards 
based on current information  we estimate that compliance with the clean air act s hazardous air pollutant standards will require in excess of million of capital expenditures including a portion of the expenditures at the new york plant referred to above  principally at our us primary aluminum plants 
for additional information concerning environmental expenditures  see note other information rates for electricity charged by the bonneville power administration bpa  which serves our primary aluminum plants in oregon and washington  are established under a new contract that expires in the new contract establishes fixed rates which are less than rates previously in effect 
these rates  however  are subject to review and approval in a process being conducted by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
third parties are challenging the contract in the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit  and the contract s rates are subject to further appeal in the courts by third parties following ferc review 
should the new contract be rejected in any of these processes  we could renegotiate with bpa or seek service from third parties 
in december  the aluminum  brick and glass workers international union voted to merge with the united steelworkers of america 
this merger was completed in january we do not expect the merger to have a material impact on the company 
liquidity and capital resources working capital december working capital ratio of current assets to current liabilities the decrease in working capital resulted primarily from the success of our inventory management program 
operating activities cash provided from operations cash provided from operating activities over the past three years was used mainly to fund investing activities 
investing activities substantial investments have been aimed at providing us with low cost operations in most of our raw materials  industrial and finished products businesses 
we have also focused on strategic areas for expansion and on further quality and efficiency enhancements 
the following table shows actual and projected capital expenditures in the following categories operational replacement equipment  environmental control projects  etc 
and strategic performance improvement  acquisitions and investments 
projected operational strategic total capital investments in finished products and other sales  strategic projects that have been completed in the past three years or that are underway include expansions and modernizations of can  foil and plastic film plants the participation in the construction of can plants in argentina  brazil  chile and saudi arabia the acquisitions of a can plant and a metals distribution business in  and a printing cylinder engraving company  foil laminating plant  and flexible packaging operation in in production and processing  strategic projects that have been completed in the past three years or that are underway include the acquisitions of additional interests in an australian alumina refinery in and a canadian primary aluminum plant in the expansion of a plant in indiana to produce bumpers and other automotive components completed in investing activities continued the modification and equipping of a purchased facility in wisconsin to produce aluminum wheels completed in a quality improvement program and equipment upgrades at a can sheet operation in alabama the modernization of a primary aluminum plant in new york the construction of a forged wheel plant in virginia as discussed below the participation in a foil and extrusion plant in china as discussed below in addition to these major projects  capacity expansions  equipment upgrades and or improvement programs have been completed or are currently underway at a number of other facilities 
in  we began construction of a million facility in virginia to manufacture aluminum wheels 
production is expected to start in the facility will use a manufacturing process that combines our computer controlled  flow formed casting technology with forging to produce lightweight wheels with added styling flexibility 
also in  we acquired a partial interest in an operation in china that produces aluminum foil and extrusions 
the operation includes a large aluminum fabricating facility that was built in the mid s and expanded later that decade 
the facility manufactures aluminum foil  primarily for the food  pharmaceutical and tobacco industries  and extrusions for the automotive and construction products markets 
capital investments planned for include amounts for those projects now underway and continuing operating requirements 
we expect to fund these capital investments with internally generated funds 
while the planned capital investments do not include amounts for acquisitions  we will evaluate any opportunities that arise 
a part of our strategy is to sell non core assets and use the proceeds in our strategic businesses 
sales over the past three years included real estate principally  developed commercial investment properties remaining gold mining assets in australia real estate principally  developed commercial investment properties austrian can plant a subsidiary that held a investment in an australian gold mine timberland in the pacific northwest financing activities we believe our available financial resources  together with internally generated funds  are sufficient to meet our present and future business needs 
we continue to exceed the financial ratio requirements contained in our financing arrangements and expect to do so in the future 
at december   million of our billion shelf registration remained available for the issuance of debt securities 
we also have a million revolving credit facility 
a summary of significant financing activities over the past three years follows financing activities continued issued million shares of prides sm  convertible preferred stock prides for stated value per share  generating million of net proceeds voluntarily prepaid the remaining balance million of a term loan agreement repaid the balance million of commercial paper outstanding contributed million shares valued at million of the company s common stock to pension plans we used proceeds from the prides issue for capital investments in and and to repay obligations incurred in the fourth quarter of to acquire miller brewing company s can plants 
borrowed million through the issuance of tax exempt bonds that require a single repayment in and bear interest at a variable rate issued million of medium term notes  which bear interest at an average rate of and mature in and contributed million shares valued at million of the company s common stock to pension plans we used proceeds from the tax exempt bonds to finance a portion of the costs of acquiring  constructing and installing environmental control facilities at our primary aluminum plant in new york 
proceeds from the medium term notes were supplemented with cash on hand and cash generated from operations to acquire the additional interest in the canadian primary aluminum plant for approximately million  plus associated working capital 
called for redemption of all outstanding shares of prides see note  which will reduce annual dividend requirements by approximately million based on the current common stock dividend substantially met our goal to fully fund our pension plans entered into million of interest rate swap agreements see note amended the million revolving credit facility arranged in to extend the term and lower the cost see note outlook in  we expect to show improvement over operating results 
this expectation is based primarily on our performance improvement program discussed below 
we also anticipate improvements in aluminum industry fundamentals and are encouraged by increases in primary aluminum prices in early looking forward  we believe the outlook for aluminum is strong 
we are forecasting a increase in us industry shipments and a increase in global aluminum consumption for  with especially strong transportation and packaging markets 
generally  order rates are increasing in all of our businesses 
outlook continued programs are in place to improve operating performance in by at least million pre tax  exclusive of price changes and in excess of inflation 
these programs include significant cost reductions in our us can business  including the closing of our houston  texas can plant completed at the end of and the start up of our modernized and more efficient torrance  california can plant aggressive cost reductions at our alabama rolling mill including reducing the workforce  principally through attrition benefits from a new power contract for our primary aluminum plants in the pacific northwest approximately million annually at our current production levels we also expect the following factors to contribute to improved results in additional soft drink can business improved results from partially owned can operations in latin america and saudi arabia stronger can sheet volume improved demand for alumina anticipated lower costs for natural gas and caustic soda used in the production of alumina we expect to strengthen our balance sheet in by managing our capital expenditures to million continuing to lower our inventory days of supply realizing cash savings from our prides redemption reducing debt by more than million selling non core assets portfolio review we are conducting a review of all our operations and businesses 
we are considering a number of alternatives that include  among other things  asset sales  spin offs and the forming of strategic alliances to increase scale 
no decisions will be made until later in in march we concluded the sale of our residential construction products business in the us included in the sale were four plants that make various aluminum and vinyl construction products  a mini mill in virginia that makes building sheet from recycled aluminum  and service centers 
we have retained our non residential building operations in georgia that produce reynobond aluminum composite panels 
the disposition of this portion of our construction products business will not materially affect the company 
we continue to negotiate the sale of our coal properties in western kentucky 
the properties include surface and mineral rights on about  acres  mineral rights on an additional  acres approximately and varying percentages of oil and gas rights on about  acres 
we have also signed letters of intent for the sale of an aluminum reclamation plant in virginia and an aluminum extrusion plant in texas 
we expect both of these transactions  which are subject to certain conditions  to close in the second quarter of proceeds from these transactions  together with proceeds from the sale of certain real estate assets scheduled to close through mid april  are expected to total approximately million 
we will use these proceeds to reduce current debt 
we expect the sale of our us residential construction products business to result in a modest gain which we will announce with our first quarter results 
risk factors this section should be read in conjunction with items and of this report and the preceding portions of this item 
this report contains and oral communications made by or on behalf of the company may contain forecasts  projections  estimates  statements of management s plans and objectives for the company and other forward looking statements 
the company s expectations for the future and related forward looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and forecasts as to world economic growth and other economic indicators including rates of inflation  industrial production  housing starts and light vehicle sales  trends in the company s key markets  global aluminum supply and demand conditions  and aluminum ingot prices  among other items 
by their nature  forward looking statements involve risk and uncertainty  and various factors could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those projected in a forward looking statement or affect the extent to which a particular projection is realized 
consensus expectations for indicate global economic growth of 
the company is forecasting a increase in us aluminum industry shipments and a increase in global aluminum consumption for the year  with especially strong transportation and packaging markets 
barring a recession in any major world economy  the company expects the improved conditions in aluminum industry supply demand fundamentals that are becoming evident at the beginning of to continue for the next several years 
the company s outlook for growth in aluminum consumption for the remainder of this decade is an average of per year 
the company expects greater use of aluminum around the world in automobiles and other light vehicles 
the company also expects us aluminum beverage can shipments to grow at about per year and global shipments to grow annually  with rapid growth of the aluminum beverage can market in latin america  asia  the middle east and other developing economies 
economic and or market conditions other than as forecast by the company in the preceding paragraph  particularly in the us  japan and germany which are large consumers of aluminum and in latin america  could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those projected in a forward looking statement or affect the extent to which a particular projection is realized 
the following factors also could affect the company s results primary aluminum is an internationally traded commodity 
the price of primary aluminum is subject to worldwide market forces of supply and demand and other influences 
prices can be volatile 
the company s current strategy of being a vertically integrated producer of value added aluminum products  and its use of contractual arrangements including fixed price sales contracts  fixed price supply contracts  and forward  futures and option contracts  reduces its exposure to this volatility but does not eliminate it 
risk factors continued the markets for most aluminum products are highly competitive 
certain of the company s competitors are larger than the company in terms of total assets and operations and have greater financial resources 
certain foreign governments are involved in the operation and or ownership of certain competitors and may be motivated by political  as well as economic considerations 
in addition  aluminum competes with other materials  such as steel  vinyl  plastics and glass  among others  for various applications in the company s key markets 
unanticipated actions or developments by or affecting the company s competitors and or the willingness of customers to accept substitutions for the products sold by the company could affect results 
the company spends substantial capital and operating amounts relating to ongoing compliance with environmental laws 
in addition  the company is involved in remedial investigations and actions in connection with past disposal of wastes 
estimating future environmental compliance and remediation costs is imprecise due to the continuing evolution of environmental laws and regulatory requirements and uncertainties about their application to the company s operations  the availability and application of technology  the identification of currently unknown remediation sites  and the allocation of costs among potentially responsible parties 
unanticipated material legal proceedings or investigations  or the disposition of those currently pending against the company other than as anticipated by management and counsel  could affect the company s results 
changes in the costs of power  resins  caustic soda  green coke and other raw materials can affect results 
a new five year contract with the bonneville power administration for the period october september will provide a fixed rate for electrical power that is less than rates previously in effect for the company s washington and oregon primary aluminum production plants 
these rates are subject to regulatory review and approval 
in addition  third parties are challenging the contract in court  and the rates are subject to further appeal in the courts by third parties following regulatory review 
the company s key transportation market is cyclical  and sales to that market in particular can be influenced by economic conditions 
a strike at a customer facility or a significant downturn in the business of a key customer supplied by the company could affect the company s results 
the company is conducting a portfolio review of all its operations and businesses 
the company is considering alternatives that include  among other things  asset sales  spin offs and formation of strategic alliances 
the timing  nature and magnitude of the actions  if any  that will be taken are not certain 
such actions  if taken  could affect the company s results and ongoing operating performance 
in addition to the factors referred to above  the company is exposed to general financial  political  economic and business risks in connection with its worldwide operations 
the company continues to evaluate and manage its operations in a manner to mitigate the effects from exposure to such risks 
in general  the company s expectations for the future are based on the assumption that conditions relating to costs  currency values  competition and the legal  regulatory  financial  political and business environments in the economies and markets in which the company operates will not change significantly overall
