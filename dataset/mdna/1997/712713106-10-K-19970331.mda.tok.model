item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains descriptions of the company s expectations regarding future trends affecting its business 
these forward looking statements and other forward looking statements made elsewhere in this document are made in reliance upon safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the following discussion sets forth certain factors the company believes could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are identified with footnote the company undertakes no obligation to update the information contained in item results of operations during october of  peoplesoft completed a merger with red pepper accounted for as a pooling of interests 
all financial data presented herein has been restated to include the financial position and results of operations of red pepper beginning january  red pepper s operations in were insignificant 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues and the percentage of period over period growth represented by certain line items in the company s consolidated statements of income years ended december  percentage of percentage of dollar increase total revenues year over year revenues license fees services total revenues costs and expenses cost of license fees cost of services sales and marketing product development general and administrative in process research and development and non recurring acquisition costs n a total costs and expenses operating income other income  interest expense and other income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues the company recognizes revenue when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been shipped  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
for customer license agreements which have payments due within one year  the portion allocated to software license fees will generally be recognized in the current period  while the portion allocated to services is recognized as the services are performed 
when the company enters into a license agreement with a customer requiring significant customization of the software products  the company recognizes revenue related to the license agreement using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
the total dollar amount of customer license agreements contracting activity signed for software license fees and services increased from million in to million in and to million in the aggregate value of customer license agreements related to hrms signed during the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the aggregate value of customer license agreements related to peoplesoft financials  distribution and manufacturing software products during the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
revenues from licensing fees increased by from million in to million in and increased by to million in the increase in license fee revenues was attributable to increased market acceptance of  and breadth of  the company s software product offerings including first commercial shipment in of peoplesoft distribution and peoplesoft financials for the public sector  in march of the first shipment of red pepper products  and the increased capacity created by the continued growth in the company s sales  marketing and customer service organizations 
revenues from services increased by from million in to million in and increased by to million in the company s customer license agreements provide for initial maintenance  training  installation and support services for specified periods or amounts 
therefore increases in customer licensing agreements have resulted in increases in revenues from these services 
service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in the relative percentage of service revenues to total revenues in the these periods was attributable to two primary factors increases in the installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance  training and other support services  and a significant investment in the company s professional services staff  which grew substantially over the comparable  and periods as a result of increased demand for peoplesoft s direct assistance during enterprise implementation projects 
total revenues increased by from million in to million in and increased by to million in during the years ended december   and  the company s international revenues were approximately  and of total revenues  respectively 
the company expects international revenues to grow substantially during  however  the percentage of international revenues in comparison to total revenues may not increase significantly during the company continues to invest heavily in building international infrastructure  developing global product functionality and translated versions of financial and other products  and expects material gains in the proportion of international revenues in and beyond 
in the event international expansion and or product globalization are not successful  it is likely to have a negative impact on the company s operating results 
costs and expenses cost of license fees consists principally of royalties  technology access fees for certain third party software products and amortization of capitalized software costs 
cost of license fees increased from million in to million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues and  and of license fee revenues in those years  respectively 
the company s system solutions are based on a combination of internally developed technology and application products  as well as bundled third party products and technology 
the continued decline in the cost of license fees as a percentage of license fee revenues in as compared to and was attributable to a relative decrease in software amortization charges  the mix of royalty bearing software products  reduction in documentation costs due to the move to the compact disk version of forward looking statement peoplesoft documentation and other reductions in royalty expenses primarily associated with certain fixed price aggregate royalty payment arrangements 
cost of license fees as a percentage of license fee revenues may fluctuate from period to period due principally to the mix of sales of royalty bearing software products in each period and seasonal fluctuations in revenues contrasted with certain fixed expenses such as the amortization of capitalized software 
royalties associated with certain software products currently under development by joint business arrangements and charges associated with software products and technologies acquired from various third party vendors may cause the cost of license fees as a percentage of license fee revenues to increase in future periods 
cost of services consist principally of account management field support  training  consulting and product support 
these costs increased from million in to million in and million in  representing  and  of total revenues and of service revenues in those years  respectively 
these increases are due to the significant expansion of the company s customer service resources across all categories  including consulting  telephone support  and account management staff 
the company anticipates these expenditures will increase in dollar amount  and may increase as a percentage of total revenues  in future periods 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in and million in  representing  and  of total revenues  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses was attributable to the company s expansion of its direct sales force  increased depreciation from related equipment and facility expenditures  investment in building an international direct sales force and increased marketing expenses for the company s expanded software product line 
the company is in the process of significantly increasing its direct sales and marketing expenditures to address certain international and vertical markets  establish an enterprise sales force structure  and fund sales organization expansion for financial  distribution and manufacturing products 
consequently  such expenses may increase as a percentage of total revenues in future periods 
software product development expenses increased from million in to million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
in addition  capitalized internal software development costs increased from million in to million in and million in software product development expenditure increases are directly attributable to increases in the company s staff of software engineers and consultants  and the associated infrastructure costs required to support product development initiatives in the following areas i expansion and enhancement of the company s core product offerings in the areas of hrms  financial management systems  and distribution materials management systems and red pepper s supply chain management software  ii the enhancement of the company s platform development  certification  product testing and overall release management capabilities  iii the continued enhancement of the company s client server architecture including its software development tools and the integration of these tools with various third party purchased or licensed technologies  iv the localization and translation of certain versions of the company s products for specific foreign markets  and v the development of certain vertical market products and versions of its core products suitable to the unique needs of customers within certain industries 
the company anticipates software product development expenditures will significantly increase in future periods due to continued incremental investment in all of the above activities and the acquisition of pmi and the associated expansion of the company s manufacturing application development activities 
in particular  the company plans to release a kanji based version of its hrms and financial software products for the japanese marketplace and multi language translations of a portion of its release products  all in the first half of overall development expenditures may increase as a percentage of revenues  particularly during the first half of general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in and million in  representing of total revenues in years and and in the dollar increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from increases in staffing and information systems infrastructure to support the company s growth and increases in expenses associated with the operation of foreign subsidiaries 
other income  consisting primarily of interest  increased from million in to million in and million in due to increased cash balances available for investment 
forward looking statement 
provison for income taxes the company s income tax provision increased from million in to million in to million in as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company has recorded million in net deferred tax assets at december  the company anticipates that its effective tax rate will be slightly lower than however  this rate may be affected by changes to the anticipated mix of geographic earnings 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations primarily through cash flows from operations and sale of equity securities 
in addition  under the company s unsecured bank line of credit  up to million is available for working capital advances 
within this amount  million may be used for the issuance of letters of credit 
this line of credit facility expires in july and is expected to be renewed at that time 
no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit facility at december  the company s operating activities provided cash of million during the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  operating cash flows have increased primarily due to increases in income before non cash items  increased non cash expenses and increases in deferred revenue and the tax benefit from employee stock transactions  which were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and deferred income taxes 
from december  to december   net accounts receivable increased from million to million and deferred revenues increased from million to million 
the increase in net accounts receivable resulted from the growth in customer licensing activity 
deferred revenue has increased as a result of the growth in customer licensing activity and the associated deferrals of revenues related to services provided to new licensees 
the company calculates accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso as the ratio of quarter end accounts receivable to the sum of quarterly revenues and the net change in deferred revenues  multiplied by the company believes this calculation is appropriate because license fees are typically billable regardless of whether revenue has been recognized or deferred 
under this method  accounts receivable days outstanding was days as of december  as compared to days as of december  the improvement in dso is the result of enhancements to the collection process and increased sales of receivables to third parties 
since billing terms of the company s agreements typically are spread out over a sequence of events including contract execution through acceptance or dates that generally span four to nine months  and revenue generation is concentrated at the end of each quarter  the company anticipates that its dso will continue to be substantial in future periods 
the exercise of common stock options and issuance of stock under stock purchase plans have represented a significant source of cash  contributing million  million and million in the years ending december   and  respectively 
in addition  the company believes granting stock options is essential in attracting and retaining key employees who are critical to the company s success 
in and  the company granted options aggregating and  respectively  of the common stock issued and outstanding at the beginning of each year 
as discussed in notes and of the consolidated financial statements  the company has continued to account for employee stock options in accordance with accounting principals board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb opinion no 
and has provided the pro forma disclosures required by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 stock based compensation sfas 
the company anticipates that it will continue to grant a significant number of options each year 
the actual number of options made available each year is based on the company s historical and anticipated revenue and profitability and comparison of the company s compensation philosophy and practice to other similar technology companies 
during the years ended december  and  the company s principal use of cash for investing activities was the purchase of property and equipment  including in december  the purchase of an office building in pleasanton  california and purchases of computer and networking equipment to accommodate employee and facility expansions and to support the company s growing training capacity requirements 
cash provided from financing activities in included the sale and issuance of warrants in november to purchase  forward looking statement shares of the company s common stock for approximately million 
these warrants carry the right to purchase the company s common stock at prices ranging from to per share of common stock 
one fifth of the warrants expire annually beginning in the fourth quarter of upon notice of exercise by the holders of the warrants  the company  at its option  may settle such exercise by either issuing the full amount of shares and receiving cash proceeds  issuing a net amount of shares with no cash proceeds  or purchasing the warrants for an amount equal to the difference between the common stock s then fair market value of the common stock and the warrant exercise price 
if the company elects to issue common stock for the warrants  it will provide the company with cash of up to million in  million in and million in while the company has not determined how the warrants will be satisfied  the warrants represent a significant source of potential liquidity 
as of december   the company had million in working capital  including million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments  consisting primarily of high quality municipal bonds and tax advantaged money market instruments 
the company believes that existing cash and short term investment balances  credit facilities  proceeds from sale of stock under the employee purchase plan and stock option exercises  potential proceeds from issuance of stock for warrants  and potential cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements  including the impact on operations of the acquisitions of red pepper and pmi  at least through factors that may effect future results the company has identified certain forward looking statements in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations by a footnote the company may also make oral forward looking statements from time to time 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this form k 
the company operates in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section lists some  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december   and  contained elsewhere in the form k 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s revenues and operating results can vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on the execution of license agreements contracting activity governing the use of the company s software products booked and shipped in that quarter 
contracting activity is difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons including i a significant portion of the company s license agreements are completed within the last few weeks of each quarter  ii the duration of the company s sales cycle is relatively long and increasingly variable because the company has broadened its marketing emphasis to encompass software product solutions for the customer s overall enterprise  thereby increasing the financial value of individual transactions and the complexity of the customer selection  negotiation and approval process  iii the size of license transactions can vary significantly  iv system replacement projects and new system evaluations may be postponed or canceled at any time due to changes in a customer s project  company management  budgetary constraints or strategic priorities  v customer evaluations and procurement processes vary significantly from company to company  and a customer s internal approval and expenditure authorization process can be arduous  even subsequent to actual vendor selection  vi the number  timing and significance of software product enhancements and new software product announcements by the company and its competitors  and vii changes in economic  political and market conditions can adversely impact business opportunities without reasonable notice 
in addition  certain license agreements executed during a quarter may not meet the company s revenue recognition criteria 
consequently  a situation could occur in which the company meets or exceeds its forecast of aggregate contracting activity  but is not able to meet its forecast for license revenues 
in addition to factors impacting contracting activity  license revenues are difficult to forecast because i the timing of new software product availability to fulfill delivery obligations under both new and existing license agreements is difficult to predict because of the increasing complexity of the company s technology  software product solutions and underlying development and testing processes  ii changes in the company s sales incentive plans have had and may continue to have an unpredictable impact on seasonal business patterns  iii enterprise transactions often involve both software products that are then currently deliverable  as well as software products that are still under development  to the extent the company enters into a license agreement for the provision of both software product categories  the license agreement and supporting schedules to the license agreement must contain very precise contractual provisions and terminology consistent with generally accepted accounting principals to permit any revenue recognition under the license agreement  iv enterprise transactions may grant rights to process data across complex  widely distributed computing environments 
due to a variety of factors including differences in relational database product performance across wide area networks  differences in speed of various communication links  differences in hardware platform performance  and other factors  there is a limited ability to accurately predict product performance under certain of these environments 
to the extent the company enters into a license agreement with an enterprise customer incorporating such non standard acceptance criteria which includes various on line and batch performance measures within such environments  revenue recognition could be postponed pending verification of the performance capabilities within the operating environment  and v all of the above factors  as well as other specific requirements under recently published proposed generally accepted accounting standards for software revenue recognition create circumstances under which the company must have very precise contractual language in order to recognize revenue upon initial product delivery 
although the company has a standard license agreement which meets the demanding criteria under generally accepted accounting principles  the company must often negotiate and revise certain terms and conditions in large enterprise transactions 
negotiation of mutually acceptable language can extend the sales cycle  and in certain situations  the company does not always obtain terms and conditions which permit recognition of revenue at the time of delivery or even under a percentage of completion method 
services revenues have varied from quarter to quarter due to changes in levels of consulting activity and the related satisfaction of significant license agreement milestones  and seasonality in training revenues which tend to lag license revenues by approximately one quarter 
possible adverse effects of recent securities issuances 
in connection with its recent acquisition of red pepper software company the acquisition and pmi  the company issued  shares of common and assumed options to purchase  shares of common stock  which may be disposed of from time to time on the open market 
a significant portion of the shares issued in the acquisition have been subject to trading restrictions which lapsed on or about february  also  the company has outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of its common stock which have exercise prices below the current market price of the common stock 
the exercise of these warrants and resale of the underlying shares or the sale of the shares issued in the acquisition could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
all share amounts in this section have been adjusted where necessary to reflect a for stock split effected by peoplesoft in november operating leverage 
consistent with many companies in the software industry  the company s business model is characterized by a very high degree of operating leverage 
employee and facility related expenditures comprise a significant portion of the company s operating costs and expenses  and are therefore  relatively fixed at least over the short term 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based  in significant part  on the company s expectations as to near term future revenue levels 
if revenue levels fall below expectations  net income is likely to be disproportionately adversely effected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase or even maintain its current level of profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
due to the foregoing  it is likely that in one or more future quarters the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public securities market analysts 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
uneven patterns of quarterly operating results 
although the company s operating budget is based on projections of a material increase in total revenues over the corresponding actual results for  the company does not believe that the percentage increases in revenues achieved in prior periods should be anticipated in future periods 
the operating results of many software companies reflect seasonal trends  and the company has been  and expects to continue to be  affected by such trends in the future 
seasonal patterns of revenue achievement can be caused by a variety of factors  including sales incentives  customer demand based on available capital budgets and release of new technologies 
future operating results uncertain 
segments of the software industry have experienced significant economic downturns characterized by decreased product demand  price erosion  technological shifts  work slowdowns and layoffs 
the company s operations may  in the future  experience substantial fluctuations from period to period as a consequence of such industry patterns  general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from customers  and other factors affecting capital spending 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
the company s continued success is dependent on its continued ability to introduce  develop and market new and enhanced versions of its software products  although there can be no assurance that such ability can be maintained 
during the first half of  the company will be realigning its north america sales organization into industry focused independent business units 
while the company believes such alignment will benefit sales in the long term  short term sales managment issue may arise which would impact license revenues during the transition period 
in addition  the company continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance and expand its technology and product offerings through potential partnerships  licenses or acquisitions which may  in the short term  negatively impact costs  expenses and earnings per share 
international operations 
the company has utilized  and will continue to utilize substantial resources and funding to build its international service and support infrastructure 
operating costs in many countries  including some of those in which the company operates  are often higher than in the united states 
in order to increase international sales in and subsequent periods  the company must continue to globalize its software product lines  expand existing  as well as establish additional  foreign operations  hire additional personnel  identify suitable locations for sales  marketing  customer service and development  and recruit international distributors and resellers in selected territories 
in the event international expansion and or product globalization are not successful  it is likely to have a negative impact on the company s operating results 
the company s sales through its foreign operations are generally denominated in each respective subsidiary s functional currency 
unexpected changes in the exchange rates for these foreign currencies could result in significant fluctuations in the foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses in future periods 
in the future  the company expects to have an increased amount of non us dollar denominated license agreements and intends to implement hedging programs designed to mitigate the potential adverse impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
competition 
the market for business application software is intensely competitive 
the company faces competition from a variety of software vendors including enterprise application software vendors  manufacturing application software vendors  supply chain management application software vendors  financial management system and hrms application software vendors  and software tools vendors 
although peoplesoft believes its success has been due in part to its early emphasis on the client server architecture  virtually all of the company s competitors now offer software products based on a client server architecture 
consequently  competitive differentiators now include more subtle architectural and technology factors  enterprise product breadth and individual product features  service reputation  product flexibility  ease of implementation  international product version availability and support  and price 
in the enterprise application software market  peoplesoft faces significant competition from sap  oracle and baan and to a lesser degree  dun bradstreet software now operating as two separate divisions of geac computer systems  inc  computer associates international  inc 
and other companies such as system software associates who previously focused primarily on the as marketplace 
in this market  the chief competitive factors include the breadth and completeness of the enterprise solution offered by each vendor  the extent of product integration across the enterprise solution and the availability of localized software products and technical support in key markets outside the united states 
primarily due to their significant worldwide presence and longer operating and product development history  both sap and oracle have certain competitive advantages over peoplesoft in each of these areas 
in addition  both sap and oracle have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources  and a larger installed base than peoplesoft 
furthermore  oracle s rdbms is a supported platform underlying a significant share of peoplesoft s installed applications 
in the manufacturing software application markets  in which peoplesoft has recently begun competing  peoplesoft faces competition from several of its existing competitors including those listed immediately above and others such as qad  ross systems and jd edwards and a large number of niche competitors already in the manufacturing market 
peoplesoft also faces competition from providers of hrms software products including cyborg  lawson  integral  inpower and ceridian  and from providers of financial management systems software products including hyperion  computron software  inc  lawson  and other smaller companies 
in addition  since june adp  and  since august  sms have the right to sublicense selected peoplesoft products in competition with peoplesoft s marketing efforts in selected markets 
in the emerging supply chain management software solutions market  which is a new market for the company previously serviced by red pepper  peoplesoft faces several current and potential competitors including i companies such as i technologies  manugistics  and numetrix software which have developed or are attempting to develop advanced planning and scheduling software products which complement or compete with mrp solutions  ii other companies that provide specialized planning and scheduling software for niche markets  including chesapeake systems  waterloo manufacturing software and cap logistics  iii other business application software vendors that may broaden their product offerings by internally developing  or by acquiring such as baan s recent acquisition of berclain group  inc and antalys  inc 
or partnering with independent developers of  advanced planning and scheduling software  iv internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments  and v companies offering standardized or customized products on mainframe and or mid range computer systems 
intense competition could potentially lead to increased price competition in the market  forcing the company to reduce prices which may result in reduced gross margins and loss of market share by the company which therefore  could materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete successfully with its existing competitors or will be able to compete successfully with new competitors 
reliance on proprietary software development tools 
the company s software products include a suite of proprietary software development tools known as peopletools  which are fundamental to the effective use of the company s software products 
while no industry standard exists for software development tools  several companies are focused specifically on providing software development tools and are attempting to establish their software development tools as accepted industry standards 
in the event that a software product other than the company s peopletools software product becomes the clearly established and widely accepted industry standard  the company may need to abandon or modify peopletools in favor of such an established standard  may be forced to redesign its software products to operate with such third party s software development tools  or may be faced with the potential sales obstacle of marketing a proprietary software product against other vendors software products incorporating a standardized software development toolset 
accordingly  in any of these cases  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  supply chain management applications marketed by the company include a suite of proprietary software development tools known as the responseagent business modeler  which face similar risks relative to its proprietary nature 
reliance on third parties for sales and marketing 
a key aspect of the sales and marketing strategy for the company is to build and maintain strong working relationships with businesses the company believes play an important role in the successful marketing of its software products 
the company s customers and potential customers often rely on third party system integrators to develop  deploy and manage client server applications 
these include i rdbms software vendors  ii hardware vendors which offer both hardware platforms and  in the case of ibm  proprietary rdbms products on which the company s software products run  iii technology consulting firms and systems integrators  some of which are active in the selection and implementation of large information systems for the information intensive organizations that comprise the company s principal customer base  and iv benefits consulting firms that are active in the implementation of hrms 
the company believes that its marketing and sales efforts are enhanced by the worldwide presence of these companies 
however  there can be no assurance that these companies  most of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than peoplesoft  will not start  or in some cases increase  the marketing of business application software in competition with peoplesoft  or will not otherwise discontinue their relationships with or support of peoplesoft 
if the company or its partners are unable to recruit and adequately train a sufficient number of consulting personnel to support the implementation of the company s software products  demand for these software products could subsequently be materially adversely affected 
in addition  peoplesoft s software application architecture  including peopletools  may facilitate reduced implementation efforts for customers compared to the competitive alternatives 
consequently  peoplesoft s software products may be a less desirable recommendation alternative for integrators who both provide selection advice and generate consulting fees from customers by providing implementation services 
due to the foregoing factors  it is reasonably possible that in a future quarter or quarters the company s operating results could fall short of the published expectations of certain public market financial analysts 
complexity of software products and product development 
peoplesoft s software products can be licensed for use with the following rdbmss and run on the following operating systems centura sqlbase windows single user version only and nt  ibm s db mvs esa or os using connectivity products from centura or sybase and separately  aix and os  informix informix online dynamic server aix  dynix  solaris  mp ras  digital unix  unisys unix  dg ux  dc osx  irix  sco open server  reliant unix  nt  sgi and hp ux  microsoft sql server nt version  oracle nt and over versions of unix  and sybase s system digital unix  hp ux  aix and solaris 
in addition  the company is in the process of porting its peopletools to apple s native macintosh family of computers 
no assurance can be given concerning the successful development of peoplesoft software products on additional platforms  the specific timing of the releases of any future software products  the performance characteristics of peoplesoft applications on additional platforms or their acceptance in the marketplace 
if the customer decides to switch to other peoplesoft supported rdbms or hardware platforms  user disruption is usually minimized because only the back end database changes  while the front end application remains the same 
in addition  there may be future or existing rdbms platforms which achieve popularity within the business application marketplace and which peoplesoft may desire to offer its applications thereon 
such future or existing rdbms products may or may not be architecturally compatible with peoplesoft s software product design 
no assurance can be given concerning the successful porting to new platforms  the specific timing of completion of any such ports or their acceptance in the marketplace 
beginning with release  the company integrated certain features of bea s tuxedo product into its applications 
over the next several releases  additional tuxedo features will be integrated to allow applications to run on a distributed basis using a multi tiered client server architecture 
congos powerplay product will be also bundled to incorporate desktop olap capabilities 
such enhancements may be critical to the competitiveness of the company s products in the future  and will generate incremental revenue for peoplesoft 
integration of these and other products is complex and no assurance can be made that these efforts will be successful or result in significant product enhancements 
software programs as complex as those offered by the company are likely to contain a number of undetected errors or bugs when they are first introduced or as new releases are thereafter released 
despite testing by the company and by third parties  errors or system performance issues may arise with the possible result of reduced acceptance of the company s software products in the marketplace 
due to the increasing number of possible combinations of vendor hardware platforms  operating systems and updated versions  peoplesoft application software products and updated versions  and rdbms platforms and updated versions  the effort and expense of developing  testing and maintaining these software product lines in an increasing number of combinations will increase  and the ability to develop consistent product performance characteristics across all of these combinations could place a significant strain on the company s development resources and product release schedules 
reliance on single client interface 
at the present time  the company supports client workstation platforms exclusively utilizing microsoft s windows family of software products  including windows peoplesoft releases prior to release only  windows nt and windows if microsoft were to fundamentally change the architecture of its software product such that users of peoplesoft s software applications experienced significant performance degradation or were rendered incompatible with future versions of microsoft s windows operating system  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely effected 
if a new user interface were to gain broad acceptance in the marketplace  there can be no assurance that peoplesoft s architecture would be compatible with such an interface 
in addition  as the company expands its software product offerings into new vertical markets  the dependency on microsoft s windows technology may adversely impact the company s ability to successfully compete in those markets 
for example  failure to support apple s macintosh platform could adversely effect peoplesoft s ability to compete in the higher education market 
the use of a web browser running on either a pc or network computer to access client server systems is rapidly emerging as an alternative client to the traditional desktop access through microsoft windows based personal computers 
the company has enabled access to its applications through this new emerging client only through the use of one of a number of third party products 
however  it is clear that the company must develop extensions of its peopletools technology which would facilitate client access to its applications using a web browser but without the use of third party solutions 
such client access via the internet will be subject to numerous risks inherent in utilizing the internet including security  availability and reliability 
no assurance can be given concerning the company s successful development of and support for new client platforms  the specific timing of their availability or their acceptance in the marketplace 
reliance on joint business arrangement 
peoplesoft has entered into a separate development arrangement development arrangement for the purpose of developing a line of student administration software applications see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
under this development arrangement  peoplesoft is the exclusive remarketer of the developed software products and pays a royalty to the development entity and funding entities based on license fees received from end user licenses of these software products 
while the intent of the development arrangement is to develop business applications which are integrated with peoplesoft s software products  there can be no assurance that such software products will in fact be integrated or that an integrated enterprise solution will be accepted by the market 
in addition  should the development arrangement require additional funds to complete development or enhance the software product  there can be no assurance that funds will be available on terms acceptable to the existing or other potential third party funding source s 
should peoplesoft acquire title to the software products or technology from the third party entity  such acquisition might be accounted for using the purchase method which is likely to result in either or both a charge to earnings for in process research and development which would be recorded in the statement of income in the period such acquisition was completed  or the creation of significant intangible assets by virtue of an allocation of a substantial portion of the purchase price to the acquired technology or other tangible assets 
such intangible assets would be amortized in future periods as a cost of operations 
application security architecture 
the company s application software products incorporate extensive security features designed to protect certain sensitive data managed by these applications from unauthorized retrieval or modification 
the company has developed a security architecture utilizing the capabilities of its own applications  the client operating system software  some of the security features contained in the rdbms platforms on which the applications run  as well as certain third party security products 
to date  the company is not aware of any violations of its application security architecture within its installed base 
although these security features are subject to constant review and enhancement  no assurances can be given concerning the successful implementation of these security features and their effectiveness within a particular customer s operating environment 
should a breach of security or a suspected breach of security occur  the accompanying publicity or any subsequent claims against the company could have an adverse impact on the demand for the company s software products and or cause a decline in the market price of the company s stock and or adversely impact the company s financial results due to lost or delayed closing of software licensing opportunities 
intellectual property and proprietary rights 
the company regards certain features of its internal operations  software and documentation as proprietary  and relies on a combination of contract  patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and other measures to protect their proprietary information 
the company received its first patent in june and its second patent in august in july  the company received title to a third patent as part of a teaming and development agreement 
the company also has four additional patent applications pending 
there can be no assurance that any issued patents will result from such applications or that  if issued  such patents will provide any meaningful competitive advantage 
existing copyright laws afford only limited protection 
the company believes that  because of the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry  trade secret and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of the company s employees  frequent product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of support services 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that peoplesoft s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
many customers of peoplesoft are beneficiaries of a source code escrow arrangement to enable the customer to acquire a future limited right to use the company s source code solely for their internal provision of maintenance services 
this possible access to the company s source code may increase the likelihood of misappropriation or other misuse of the company s intellectual property 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which the company s software products are or may be licensed do not protect the company s software products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the company does not believe that its software products  third party software products the company offers under sublicense agreements  company trademarks or other company proprietary rights infringe the property rights of any third parties 
however  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future with respect to current or future software products or that any such assertion may not require the company to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
product liability 
the company s license agreements with their customers contain provisions designed to limit their exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in such license agreements may not be valid as a result of federal  state  local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  the license and support of its software for use in mission critical applications creates the risk of a claim being pursued against the company 
damage or injunctive relief resulting under such a successful claim could cause a materially adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  as peoplesoft begins to compete in the manufacturing software application market  the mission critical nature of such software products may increase peoplesoft s exposure to product liability claims against the company 
growth in operations 
the company has experienced an extended period of significant revenue growth  growth in the company s customer base  expansion of its software product lines and supported platforms both through internal development and merger and acquisition  a significant expansion in the number of its employees  and expansion in the geographic scope of its operations 
this growth has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel  and has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain upon the company s management  operating  and financial controls and resources 
to accommodate recent growth  compete effectively  and manage potential future growth  the company must continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
in addition  the company must continue to expand  train and manage its employee base 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage this expansion effectively  or that the company s personnel  procedures  systems and controls will be adequate to support the company s future operations 
key personnel 
peoplesoft believes that its continued success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
the loss of services of one or more of the company s key employees could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company continues to hire a significant number of additional sales  service and technical personnel 
competition for the hiring of such personnel in the software industry is intense  and the company from time to time experiences difficulty in locating candidates with appropriate qualifications  particularly within various desired geographic locations 
it is widely held that the technology industry is at or beyond a condition of full employment 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel it requires to develop  market and support new or existing software 
expansion of facilities 
the company has expanded and plans to continue to significantly expand the number of employees at its corporate headquarters location in pleasanton  california 
the company acquired a building during to address office space needs  however  the space is partially occupied by existing tenants and may not be available rapidly enough to meet the company s needs 
in addition  beginning in december  the company has undertaken development of an additional facility under a lease which will provide substantial new space 
however  additional  alternative office space is required to address planned expansion 
the commercial real estate market in the tri valley area is constrained by the extremely low rate of new commercial real estate development over the past several years which makes obtaining additional quality office space increasingly difficult 
the company is in the process of attempting to locate and contract for adequate space  however  sufficient office space may not become available to meet the company s near term needs 
there can be no assurance that local facilities will be obtained  that reasonable terms will be obtained or that acceptable financing arrangements may be obtained 
any such failure to obtain local facilities  under commercially reasonable terms  may result in lower employee productivity  constrained hiring plans or increased facility charges which could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business and operating results 
recently  commercial building vacancy rates have significantly dropped in many of the markets where the company has significant operations 
as a consequence  the company expects to experience increasing difficulty in obtaining additional space within which to expand its operations 
failure to either obtain space  or obtain it on reasonably attractive commercial terms  may inhibit the company s ability to grow  or otherwise adversely effect the company s operations and financial results 
volatility of stock price 
as is frequently the case with stock of high technology companies  the market price of peoplesoft s stock has been and may continue to be quite volatile 
factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  announcements of technological innovations by the company or its competitors or the introduction of new products by peoplesoft or its competitors  and macroeconomic conditions in the computer hardware and software industries generally  may have a significant impact on the market price of the stock of peoplesoft 
if revenue or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the expectations published or otherwise of the investment community  there could be an immediate impact on peoplesoft s stock price 
in addition  as described in the possible adverse effects of recent securities issuances section above  the company has issued shares  stock options and warrants which  if sold directly or exercised and sold on the open market in large concentrations  could cause the company s stock price to decline in the short term 
the company makes no assurance as to when and if such a short term stock price decline may recover 
furthermore  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of the stock of peoplesoft 
investments and liquidity 
the company s short term and long term investments consist primarily of high quality municipal bonds  us government securities  corporate debt securities and tax advantaged money market instruments 
despite favorable credit ratings on these investments there can be no assurance the issuing agencies will not default on their obligations which may result in losses of principal and accrued interest by peoplesoft 
while operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent the company experiences growth in the future  operating and investing activities may use cash  and  consequently  such growth may require the company to obtain additional sources of financing 
in addition  material acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies and capital expenditures may require additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain additional sources of financing or additional financing at terms favorable to the company
