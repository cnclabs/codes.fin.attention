in november  the company redeemed all of its outstanding convertible debentures due  which aggregated  in principal amount  incurring an extraordinary loss from the early extinguishment of debt of  the company considers funds from operations ffo to be a relevant supplemental measure of the performance of an equity reit since such measure does not recognize depreciation and certain amortization expenses as operating expenses 
management believes that reductions for these charges are not meaningful in evaluating income producing real estate  which historically has not depreciated 
ffo means net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  before gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation of real property 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
during  the company reported that ffo increased  to  in from  in if the one time charges in were excluded  the company would have reported a decrease in ffo in of  this decrease was net of several effects  but was primarily attributable to the expiration of the mcdonnell douglas lease and the subsequent sale of the building in june of  the sale of the beverly garland hotel in december of  lower rents received on the anacomp building following the renegotiation of the anacomp lease during the first quarter of  and higher expenses related to the opening of regional offices in los angeles and san francisco

the principal reasons for this decrease are discussed in the following paragraphs 
revenues decreased  to  in from  in this decrease is primarily due to the changes in estimation techniques previously mentioned  recognition in of certain tenant percentage rents that were not estimatable at the end of  and a decrease in other percentage rents and sale of the a storage facility in rental operating expenses decreased  to  in from  in the decrease is primarily due to the sale of a storage 
the provision for bad debt increased  to  in from  in this increase is primarily attributable to higher than normal credit problems amongst smaller tenants and a decision by the company to increase the general provision for bad debt by  interest expense increased  to  in from  in the increase is primarily attributable to a higher short term interest rate environment for much of and slightly higher average outstanding borrowings under the company s lines of credit 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  to  in from  in the increase reflects additional depreciation expense for rehabilitations of existing properties during and general and administrative expenses increased  to  in from  in the increase reflects the previously mentioned one time charges

if the one time charges were excluded  the company would have reported ffo of  in  a decrease of  from liquidity and capital resources liquidity the company anticipates that cash flow from operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital for required payments on notes payable  recurring tenant improvements  and dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements through the end of however  the company will require additional sources of capital to finance the acquisition and development of additional properties 
sources of this additional capital may include borrowings under credit facilities and mortgage indebtedness  proceeds from sales of non strategic assets  the sale of interests in certain properties to third parties and  to the extent market conditions permit  the issuance of debt or equity securities 
however  there can be no assurances that capital necessary to finance future acquisitions and developments will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
the company satisfied its reit requirement under the internal revenue code of of distributing at least of ordinary taxable income with distributions to shareholders of  in accordingly  federal income taxes were not incurred at the corporate level

in  cash flow used by financing activities included a net repayment on credit facilities of  and distributions of  partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of stock of  effects of inflation substantially all of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in these operating expenses resulting from inflation to the extent that its properties are occupied 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to short term interest rates and may  from time to time  enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate loans
