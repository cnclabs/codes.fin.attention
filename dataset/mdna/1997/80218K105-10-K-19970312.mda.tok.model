the company s average hedged sales price for natural gas increased per mcf from the average to per mcf in general as an independent oil and gas producer  the company s results of operations are dependent upon the difference between the prices received for oil and gas and the costs of finding and producing such resources 
a material portion of the company s crude oil production is from long lived fields in the san joaquin valley of california where eor methods are being utilized 
the market price of the heavy ie  low gravity  high viscosity and sour ie  high sulfur content crude oils produced in these fields is lower than sweeter  light ie  low sulfur and low viscosity crude oils  reflecting higher transportation and refining costs 
in addition  the lifting costs of heavy crude oils are generally higher than the lifting costs of light crude oils

the foregoing estimates do not give effect to changes in any other factors  such as the effect of the company s hedging program or its debt levels and related interest expense  that might result from a change in natural gas prices 
from time to time the company hedges a portion of its oil and gas sales to provide a certain minimum level of cash flow from its sales of oil and gas 
while the hedges are generally intended to reduce the company s exposure to declines in market price  the company s gain from increases in market price may be limited 
the company uses various financial instruments whereby monthly settlements are based on differences between the prices specified in the instruments and the settlement prices of certain futures contracts quoted on the new york mercantile exchange nymex or certain other indices 
generally  in instances where the applicable settlement price is less than the price specified in the contract  the company receives a settlement based on the difference  in instances where the applicable settlement price is higher than the specified price  the company pays an amount based on the difference

gains or losses on hedging activities are recognized in oil and gas revenues in the period in which the hedged production is sold 
the company has open crude hedges on an average of approximately  barrels per day for the period january to july the instruments used have floors ranging from to per barrel and ceilings ranging from to per barrel 
under the terms of the instruments  if the aggregate average of the applicable daily settlement prices is below the floor  the company will receive a settlement based on the difference  and if the aggregate average of the applicable daily settlement prices is above the ceiling  the company will be required to pay an amount based on the difference

as a result of this program  the company s royalty rate on its federal leases which produce heavy oil all of which are operated by monterey has been reduced from to an average of  resulting in a net increase in the production attributable to the company s net revenue interests in such leases of approximately  barrels per day 
the royalty reduction will be terminated upon the first to occur of i the determination by the blm that the wti average oil price as adjusted for inflation has remained above per barrel for six consecutive months and ii such time after september   as the secretary of the interior determines that the heavy oil royalty rate reduction has not produced the intended results ie  to reduce the loss of otherwise recoverable reserves

the company increased its proved reserves net of production and sales by approximately over the five years ended december   however  no assurances can be given that such increase will occur in the future 
historically  the company has generally funded development and exploration expenditures and working capital requirements from cash provided by operating activities

to the extent monterey continues to pay such dividends  santa fe will receive dividends of approximately million per quarter assuming a quarterly dividend of per share until the proposed spin off is consummated 
such amounts would be available to fund the company s operations  other than those conducted by monterey

initial public offering and proposed spinoff in the third quarter of the company announced its intention to separate its operations in the state of california from the rest of its domestic and international operations 
in november such operations were assumed by monterey which subsequently issued million shares of its common stock in an initial public offering 
the proceeds from the offering were primarily used to retire certain of the company s then outstanding long term debt 
see items and business and properties monterey resources  inc 
the company has announced that it intends to distribute pro rata to its common shareholders all of its remaining ownership interest in monterey by means of a tax free distribution 
the proposed spin off is subject to certain conditions including  the receipt of a ruling from the internal revenue service that such a distribution would be tax free  the approval of such distribution by the company s common shareholders  the absence of any future change in the market or economic conditions including developments in the capital markets or the company s or monterey s business or financial condition that causes the company s board of directors to conclude that the proposed spin off is not in its shareholders best interests and the final declaration of the proposed spin off by the company s board of directors 
the proposed spin off is not expected to occur prior to july the company is taking these actions because of its belief that its oil and gas operations have developed over time into separate businesses that operate independently and have diverging capital requirements and risk profiles 
in addition  the board of directors believes that dividing the company s operations into two independent companies will allow each to more efficiently develop its distinct resource base and pursue separate business opportunities while providing each with improved access to capital markets 
the board of directors also believes that the ipo and the proposed spin off will allow investors to better evaluate each business  enhancing the likelihood that each would achieve appropriate market recognition for its performance 
if the proposed spin off occurs  the market price of the company s common stock will decline to reflect the distribution of the monterey common stock and the increased shares available in the market may have an adverse effect on the market price of monterey s common stock 
also in november  the company completed the purchase of million of the million outstanding shares of its convertible preferred stock  series  for per share  net to the seller in cash 
the company made the offer because it believes that the goals of the proposed spin off can be better achieved by reducing the number of preferred shares outstanding and simplifying the company s capital structure 
environmental matters almost all phases of the company s oil and gas operations are subject to stringent environmental regulation by governmental authorities 
such regulation has increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning oil and gas wells and other facilities 
the company has expended significant financial and managerial resources to comply with such regulations 
although the company believes its operations and facilities are in general compliance with applicable environmental regulations  risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in oil and gas operations 
it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies or claims for damages to property  employees  other persons and the environment resulting from the company s operations  could result in significant costs and liabilities in the future 
as it has done in the past  the company intends to fund its cost of environmental compliance from operating cash flows
