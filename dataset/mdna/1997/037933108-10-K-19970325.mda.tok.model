item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations basis of presentation apria healthcare group inc the company was formed by the merger of abbey healthcare group incorporated abbey and homedco group  inc homedco in june the merger 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  accordingly  the consolidated financial statements and narrative herewith reflect the combined financial position and operating results of abbey and homedco for all periods presented 
results of operations net revenues net revenues increased in to billion from billion in  and increased in from revenues of million 
the modest growth in was primarily attributable to volume increases in managed care markets and to a lesser extent traditional markets 
the increase in net revenues in  as compared to  was due to volume increases in managed care markets and new business generated from the acquisition of several complementary companies 
price competition in the managed care environment had a mitigating impact on the growth in both and respiratory therapy  infusion therapy and home medical equipment other revenues represent  and  respectively  of total net revenues 
in  respiratory therapy decreased by largely because of the disruptions caused by the merger related facility consolidations and systems conversions 
both of these factors caused a temporary shift in focus away from traditional business  the impact of which was greatest on the respiratory line 
infusion therapy and home medical equipment other grew at rates of and  respectively 
the increases in both of these lines were largely due to volume increases in managed care 
also  the infusion line benefited from focused sales force training on infusion therapy 
approximately of the company s revenues are reimbursed under the federal medicare program 
it is currently uncertain what impact the continuing changes in healthcare regulations and reimbursement may have on the company s future revenues 
gross profit gross margins were in  in and in in general  gross margins are being reduced by the company s increased participation in the managed care environment 
in  the company derived approximately of its revenues from managed care organizations 
the intense competition in the managed care market has caused considerable price compression 
also  competing in the managed care market requires a broad offering of products and services  including lower margin services  medical equipment and supplies 
to address this downward pressure on gross margins  the company has adopted numerous initiatives including the establishment of automated purchasing budgets to more effectively control the purchase and use of patient service equipment and supplies  the placement of sales force initiatives on certain higher margin products and services and an effort to redirect the business development focus toward higher margin traditional referral payor sources 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  management initiated a contract assessment process whereby the company s top revenue producing accounts were reviewed for profitability 
approximately two thirds of these contracts were renegotiated at better pricing and business mix and the remaining one third were terminated due to unacceptable profitability levels 
further  with the information system conversions complete  management now has access to standardized information not previously available 
detailed management reporting tools are being developed to quickly identify products and services not meeting profitability standards and to evaluate product service mix at an individual branch level 
other factors impacting the gross margin include a fourth quarter adjustment of million to provide for excess and obsolete patient service equipment and supplies and a third quarter change in the depreciable lives of certain classes of patient service equipment 
the fourth quarter adjustment was determined based on the results of the company s year end physical inventory and quantity reconciliation procedures 
the change in depreciable lives was based on management s analysis which indicated that the equipment would continue in service beyond the economic lives over which they were being depreciated 
the change resulted in a reduction to the cost of net revenues in of million of which million related to a single asset type for which the depreciable life was extended from four to twelve months 
the gross margin was impacted by an adjustment of million to conform the accounting policies of the predecessor companies for certain low dollar patient service equipment items  supplies and accessories and a million provision for excess and obsolete patient service equipment and shrinkage associated with the company s facility consolidations 
selling  distribution and administrative selling  distribution and administrative expenses expressed as percentages of net revenues were  and  for  and  respectively 
much of the improvement in  and to a lesser extent  can be attributed to the successful execution of the restructuring and consolidation plan initiated in conjunction with the merger see certain operating statement captions 
the primary sources of savings associated with the plan are the completed employee reductions and facility consolidations 
also contributing to the improvement in as compared to was the cessation of various integration costs included in the amount 
such costs  which totaled approximately million  included employee relocation  temporary and transitional employee costs  overtime pay and consulting 
further  management continually evaluates its operating cost structure to identify opportunities to effectively minimize the cost of providing healthcare 
management reporting  budgets and incentives are among the tools being utilized to control operating costs 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenues was  and for  and  respectively 
although lower than the doubtful accounts provision rate  the rate exceeded the rate and reflects a fourth quarter increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
the increase was based on management s year end analysis of accounts receivable and resulted from an increase in the fourth quarter in accounts aged over days 
the provision for doubtful accounts included million for an impairment in abbey s infusion therapy accounts receivable  million resulting from the application of more conservative allowance percentages to abbey s home medical equipment and respiratory therapy accounts aged in excess of days and million for the anticipated impact on realization of the company s accounts receivable resulting from field location consolidations  changes in billing and collection personnel and information systems conversions see liquidity and capital resources 
the circumstances leading to the million provision for abbey s infusion therapy accounts are discussed below 
abbey had entered the infusion market primarily through its acquisitions of total pharmaceutical care  inc  tpc and protocare  inc 
protocare in november and january  respectively 
from the point of acquisition through the end of  the receivables of the acquired tpc business were processed centrally in two billing centers 
cooperation and assistance from the branch pharmacy personnel responsible for the initiation and fulfillment of orders was an important aspect of centralized billing and collection 
in mid  many of the former tpc branch and region level managers were terminated due to the post acquisition integration of tpc s branch pharmacy operations into abbey s organizational structure 
these changes had a negative impact on the morale of the branch pharmacy personnel and resulted in significant turnover and less cooperation with billing center personnel 
also in mid  one of the billing centers was relocated and only a portion of the personnel were transferred to the new location 
consequently  numerous new billing and collection employees were hired and trained 
in early  abbey began to convert and  in some cases  automate for the first time  the billing and collection procedures of the acquired tpc operations and convert and centralize the billing and collection functions of the acquired protocare branches 
these changes  coupled with the announcements on march  of the abbey homedco merger and later of branch consolidations  led to significant turnover of billing and collection personnel in the acquired protocare branches 
all of these conditions and disruptions had a negative impact on the aging of abbey s infusion receivables 
in response to the deteriorating aging  abbey management deployed additional resources and instituted programs to limit potential collection losses 
these efforts included hiring an infusion reimbursement specialist  reengineering the centralized infusion billing center procedures  hiring additional manager and director level personnel and instituting collection incentive programs 
in the third quarter of  the company s management decided to transfer the infusion billing and collection processes from abbey s recently converted centralized system to homedco s decentralized  branch based system 
many of the incentive and other programs instituted by abbey management were discontinued in order to focus resources and efforts on completing branch consolidations  effecting the planned system conversions  training personnel in the proper use of the new systems and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the intake function 
during the process  the centralized billing center was downsized and relocated a second time  pending permanent closure at a later date 
each of these post merger decisions caused additional turnover at the billing centers responsible for collecting the existing receivables and seriously impacted employee morale 
in connection with management s post merger accounts receivable analysis  serious consideration was given to the impact that the merger  planned branch consolidations and system conversions and reductions in force would likely have on the already unstable condition of abbey s infusion accounts receivable 
as a result of a marked deterioration in the aging of abbey s infusion accounts and other deteriorating trends  a provision of million was recorded 
employee contracts  benefit plan and claim settlements in  the company recorded million in benefit plan and claim settlement costs 
included are settlement amounts and related costs of million recorded in connection with two legal matters  settlement and associated costs of million related to the november termination of a proposed merger with vitas healthcare corporation and an increase in the estimated accrual for the settlement loss on the termination of the company s defined benefit pension plan of million 
employee contracts  benefit plan and claim settlements of million were recorded in the total includes approximately million provided for employment and payroll tax related claims and lawsuits  million to settle certain employee contracts  and a settlement loss of million on the termination of the company s defined benefit pension plan 
certain operating statement captions in connection with the merger  the company initiated a significant consolidation and restructuring plan to consolidate operating locations and administrative functions within specific geographic markets 
the plan provided for a workforce reduction of approximately  employees  consolidation of approximately operating facilities and conversion of branch operating locations to a standardized information system 
the employee reduction and branch consolidations were substantially complete as of december the company had also completed about half of the information system conversions as of december  the remaining system conversions were completed by september during  a charge of approximately million was recorded in connection with the consolidation and restructuring plan 
the primary components of the restructuring charge included severance and related costs of million due to workforce reductions  million associated with the consolidation of information systems  million related to the closure of duplicate facilities and million for other restructuring activities 
merger costs of approximately million were incurred during and consisted primarily of fees for investment banking  legal  consulting  accounting  filing requirements  and  as required by the merger agreement  the cost of a six year liability insurance policy covering directors and officers of the predecessor companies against claims arising from pre merger facts or events 
interest expense interest expense increased in to million  from million in and million in the increases in both years are primarily due to increases in long term debt 
the increase was mitigated by a reduction in interest rates see liquidity and capital resources 
income taxes income tax expense for amounted to million and represented of income before taxes 
the deductibility in of certain accruals and merger related reserves established in resulted in a current year tax loss  an increase in refundable taxes due to a carryback of a portion of the tax loss  and a decrease in net deferred tax assets 
management believes that future taxable income will be sufficient to assure the realization of deferred tax assets  net of the recorded valuation allowance 
the tax benefit of million was primarily attributable to losses related to merger reserves and restructuring charges recorded during income tax expense for represents the combined tax provisions of homedco and abbey 
the combined effective tax rate for was  which exceeded the statutory rate primarily because of the effects of non deductible goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources cash used in the company s operating activities for was million compared with million in and  in the primary contributor to the increased use of cash in and was the increase in accounts receivable 
accounts receivable  before allowance for doubtful accounts  increased million in in addition  the company s average collection period increased to approximately days from approximately days in and days in these conditions are primarily attributable to disruptions and delays in billing and collection activity associated with the company s conversion of its field locations to a standardized information system and a higher than normal turnover rate among billing and collection personnel in and  to a lesser degree  to the continuing impact of facility consolidations and employee reductions made in late and early in connection with the company s restructuring and consolidation plan 
in connection with the facility consolidations  each branch information system was first converted to the predominate system in place within its region 
conversion of the branches to a standard  company wide system then occurred on a region by region basis 
because of the conversion to interim systems prior to final conversion  locations representing approximately of the company s accounts receivable underwent conversion 
of the planned conversions  about half were completed by december  the remaining conversions  comprised mainly of the company s larger branches  were completed by september  with  and performed in the first  second and third quarters  respectively 
these activities contributed to billing delays and errors and  ultimately  difficulties in receiving timely reimbursement 
management s year end accounts receivable analysis considered the continuing impact on the aging of accounts and collection activity caused by system conversions and employee turnover and the degree of effectiveness of billing and collection improvement programs initiated during the year 
in addition  management conducted a review of patient billing files and analyzed subsequent realization for selected billing locations 
based on such analyses  management estimated and recorded in the fourth quarter of a million adjustment to reduce accounts receivable and net revenues and a million adjustment to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts see results of operations 
revenue adjustments result from incorrect contract prices entered upon service delivery due to complex contract terms  a biller s lack of familiarity with a contract or payor or an incorrect system price  subsequent changes to estimated revenue amounts for services not covered by a preexisting contract  and failure subsequent to service delivery to qualify a patient for reimbursement due to lack of authorization or a missed filing or appeal deadline 
revenue adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application or upon account review 
the increase in the company s average collection period in has increased the level of unidentified revenue adjustments accumulating in accounts receivable 
in addition  the significant number of system conversions performed in the second and third quarters of and the high rate of turnover among billing and collection personnel impeded normal processing and account reviews and resulted in an increased rate of billing errors in the second half of to mitigate the impact of conversion disruptions and employee turnover  the company  among other steps  initiated collection incentive programs with special emphasis on older accounts  assembled an accounts receivable task force  hired additional management level billing and collection personnel and initiated reinforcement training for the billing locations 
subsequent to year end  the company took further steps to reduce the incidence of billing errors 
these steps include a process review of the field information system to identify opportunities to improve billing processing  timeliness and accuracy  validation of system pricing files and implementation of billing center audits to assess compliance with billing practices and procedures 
cash collections at locations that were converted in early have shown recent improvement 
because of the significant number of conversions completed in the second and third quarters of  a return to routine processing and normal collection time frames on a company wide basis is not expected before mid the company centralized its accounts payable function in connection with the consolidation and restructuring plan 
the centralization process disrupted day to day activities causing a processing backlog  which was reflected in the accounts payable balance at december  during the first two quarters of  the backlog was substantially eliminated  resulting in significant outlays of cash 
other factors contributing to the use of cash and corresponding increase in long term debt include purchases of patient service equipment and supplies to support business growth and payments made against the restructuring accruals for severance and trailing facility costs 
such payments are expected to continue through the year  according to contractual terms 
approximately million in data processing equipment was purchased in  much of which was to support the information systems conversions and enhancements and to upgrade and standardize the consolidated field locations 
hardware purchases in are planned at million 
income tax refunds of million were received in  and the application of prior year payments and alternative minimum tax credits to current year estimated tax requirements reduced cash outlays for income taxes by million 
during  the company made acquisitions of complementary businesses in specific geographic markets which resulted in cash payments of million 
the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options yielded million in effective august   the company entered into an agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for borrowings of up to million 
the agreement is structured as an unsecured  five year revolving line of credit  which provides for variable rate interest options including the higher of the federal funds rate plus per annum or the bank of america reference rate  or a rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus up to per annum 
the libor option is subject to discount if the company achieves certain targeted ratios of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the agreement contains numerous restrictions including  but not limited to  covenants requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios  limitations on additional borrowings  capital expenditures  mergers  acquisitions and investments and restrictions on cash dividends  loans and other distributions 
loan proceeds are being used to meet the working capital needs of the company 
the company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes 
interest rate swap and cap agreements are used as a means of managing the company s interest rate exposure 
the swap agreements are contracts to periodically exchange fixed and floating interest rate payments over the life of the agreement 
the company s exposure to credit loss under these agreements is limited to the interest rate spread in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the contracts 
the company anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
the company is currently party to two swap agreements an month agreement covering million in notional principal with a fixed interest rate of and a two year agreement covering million of notional principal with a fixed interest rate of 
both agreements allow the counterparty an option to terminate after one year  if these options are not exercised  the million and million contracts terminate in february and november  respectively 
in  the company received interest at a weighted average rate of and paid interest at a weighted average rate of  the difference of which represents the benefit derived by the company under the various swap contracts in effect during the year 
payment or receipt of the interest differential is made on a monthly and quarterly basis for the million and million agreements  respectively  and recognized monthly in the financial statements as an adjustment to interest expense 
under a cap agreement  which expired in july  the company limited the three month libor rate to on outstanding indebtedness of up to million

the company is currently in the third year of a five year agreement to purchase medical supplies totaling million  with annual purchases ranging from million in the first year to million in the third through fifth years 
failure to purchase at least of the annual commitment would have resulted in a penalty of of the difference between the annual commitment and actual purchases  beginning with the twelve month period ended august  actual purchases for that period exceeded the annual commitment by
