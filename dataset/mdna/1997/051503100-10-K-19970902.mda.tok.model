for such forward looking statements  the company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of shareholders and the investing public should understand that such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause results or developments to differ significantly from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the overall level of sales by oems in the telecommunications  data communications  computer peripherals and the medical markets  buying patterns of the company s existing and prospective customers  the impact of new products introduced by competitors  higher than expected expense related to sales and new marketing initiatives  availability of adequate supplies of raw materials and components  and other risks involving the company s target markets generally results of operations net sales for fiscal were  up from net sales of  in fiscal which were up by from net sales of  in fiscal the improvement for each year is due principally to two factors first  strong growth in the telecommunications and data communications industries where the company s products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems for use in applications such as modems  network routers  and wide as well as local area network systems 
second  effectiveness of the company s strategies in partnering with oem customers to provide competitively priced power conversion products 
as well as engineering and other services required in the development of their new products 
as a contributing factor to its strategy of customer support  the company introduced eighteen new products in fiscal  compared to fifteen and eleven in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
one of the fiscal introductions was a family of watt switching power supplies that is based on the company s patented high density power conversion technology 
a second new high density product  a watt switching power supply is planned for introduction during the second quarter of fiscal this new product will open opportunities for the company in the telecommunications and data communications market for applications that require this higher level of power 
representing another important achievement  in fiscal  the company signed an agreement with shinko shoji  a large japanese international distributor of electronic products 
under the agreement  shinko shoji will be an independent representative and distributor of the company s products through out asia 
the alliance is enabling quicker access to potential new customers in the pacific rim  but has not yet resulted in any significant orders 
the company also has an agreement with moli energy  a japanese manufacturer of lithium ion rechargeable batteries  wherein the company will have exclusive rights to provide its battery chargers in support of moli s batteries 
lithium ion batteries  as compared to other types of batteries are lighter  longer lasting and more environmentally safe 
the product designed by the company is awaiting agency approval 
also  to augment low cost production capabilities being provided by its wholly owned korean subsidiary and subcontractors in china and thailand  the company established a wholly owned manufacturing operation in northern china during the third quarter of fiscal the new facility commenced shipment of transformer products late in the fourth quarter and will be equipped to manufacture all of the company s products 
in spite of these favorable conditions for the company  two currently prevailing market factors are expected to delay the growth in revenues that was anticipated to occur in early fiscal first  certain customers in the telecommunications and data communications market have elected to delay introduction of new products  choosing instead to continue to promote and sell existing designs 
it is believed that receipt of orders for support of new products will begin during the second quarter of fiscal second  although the company is a leading supplier of power conversion products for cable modems  advancements in the infrastructure  such as transmission stations and wired systems needed to support faster growth in the use of cable modems are not yet in place and are anticipated to delay introduction by oems of new cable modem products for approximately five months 
markets for modems used in other transmission systems are growing at anticipated rates 
because of these two reasons  the company believes that revenues for its first quarter of fiscal may only approximate the revenues that were achieved in its first quarter of fiscal  although it is anticipated that revenues for the year will compare favorably with the revenues recorded in fiscal the company s order backlog at june   was  down from  at june   and as compared to  at may  the order backlog at june   represents shipments for approximately four months and reflects the current posture of many oems to limit their contractual commitments to the best lead time of their customers 
gross profit for fiscal amounted to  or of net sales  compared to  which was of net sales for fiscal  and  equaling of net sales in fiscal the improved gross profit for each fiscal year is due principally to the higher sales with essentially little change in the company s fixed cost structure 
also in fiscal  products that were sold contained a greater proportion of higher margin switching power supplies than were contained in products that were sold for the previous fiscal year 
operating expenses for fiscal totaled  or of net sales  compared to  for fiscal  which was also of net sales 
in fiscal  operating expenses were  or of net sales 
compared to fiscal  the increased expenditure of  in fiscal was incurred for commissions paid to sales representatives on the greater sales and other marketing expenses incurred for sales promotional activities and to position the company to compete in the asian market 
the company also incurred additional expenses to upgrade its management information system  and for administration of its foreign manufacturing activities 
compared to fiscal  the increased expenditure of  in fiscal was incurred principally for the greater but proportionate commissions paid to sales representatives on the higher sales  and increased engineering and administrative costs due respectively  to greater agency fees to certify new products  and larger administrative costs associated with foreign business activities 
it is the policy of the company to make performance bonus payments to its us employees for attaining certain levels of planned profitability 
accordingly  payments amounting to two weeks of salaries were made in fiscal and fiscal and one week of salaries in fiscal operating income increased by to  in fiscal from  in fiscal fiscal income represented an increase of from  in fiscal non operating income of   and  for fiscal  and  respectively  were primarily interest income  currency exchange rate gains from importation of raw material by the korean subsidiary and income derived from rented portions of the korean manufacturing facility 
the company incurred interest expenses of  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal interest expenses declined in fiscal and interest income increased due to the availability of funds that were raised from the public offering of common shares in the third quarter of the year  portions of which were used for the repayment of interest bearing indebtedness

deferred tax assets are recognizable as assets on financial statements only when there is favorable evidence by past and anticipated operation performances that they are likely to be of future benefit to the organization 
because of its past three years of performance and its future outlook  the company determined that this test was met  therefore deferred tax assets amounting to  were recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal together with a recorded income tax expense of  which contained an amount of  associated with the exercise of stock options  the recognition resulted in a net tax benefit to the company of  and increased net income after tax to  in fiscal  the company had pre tax income of  on which  after the utilization of nol resulted in income tax expense of  utilization of tax credits and nol is limited by the alternative minimum income tax
