item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subsequent events 
the first product resulting from this acquisition  agentxpressnt  is expected to be introduced in the second quarter and will bring a high performance automatic call distribution offering to the company s telephony oriented advanced cti application product family targeted at the call center 
the company continues to evaluate complementary technologies and distribution channels to further implement its strategic growth initiative 
products the company s product lines follow its primary strategies and fall into two categories  telephony oriented and computer oriented 
the company currently develops and supports three telephony oriented product lines callxpress  phonexpress and px callxpress  the company s premier  multi application  high capacity cti product  was introduced in early phonexpress  introduced in  is positioned for the organization requiring high performance call answering and routing and voice mail  but not requiring the advanced application orientation or capacity that a callxpress system provides 
px is designed to address the basic voice mail and call answering requirements of the growing small business and professional services market 
all three product lines are either sold as software kits to dealers who obtain their own hardware  or sold fully integrated on company provided personal computer hardware platforms 
software kits consist of callxpress  phonexpress or px software  documentation  a hardware security key  voice cards and fax cards 
fully integrated callxpress  phonexpress  and px system platforms include all the components supplied in the software kits  plus fully integrated and tested personal computers  disk drive storage devices of various sizes and configurations  modems  monitors and keyboards 
with the acquisition of selected assets and liabilities of telcom technologies in january  the company has added its fourth telephony oriented product line  agentxpressnt  an automatic call distribution system targeted at small to medium sized call centers 
the company s premier computer oriented product line  rightfax  is a high performance  lan based fax server 
the rightfax server is targeted at organizations with high volumes of outgoing or incoming fax traffic  many fax users  or where incoming fax documents require very secure and confidential management 
the rightfax server is sold as software only or as a software kit including fax cards 
callxpress callxpress is the company s premier  telephony oriented multi application cti product 
designed to support from to telephone ports  and basic to advanced cti applications such as unified messaging  call management  and interactive voice response  callxpress can serve the needs of small to large enterprises 
all callxpress application modules consist of software programs that operate in an integrated  multi tasking environment and are not dependent on secondary hardware processors 
modules may be purchased either at initial installation or as add on upgrades 
while it was developed with a telephony orientation  the standard lan connection capability of callxpress and software modular packaging makes it a true bridge product to the computer oriented world 
when combined with the wide range of port and storage options available  the company believes that its callxpress systems offer users the flexibility to meet their varied and changing needs 
callxpress software modules are divided into three application categories call processing  unified messaging  and call center productivity 
call processing applications automated attendant voice mail 
the automated attendant voice mail module answers calls on the first ring and invites the caller to do one of the following enter an extension number  enter a name to obtain an extension number  wait on the line for a receptionist  or leave a voice mail message 
subscribers may leave voice mail messages and review messages received before sending them on or deleting them 
the audiotext feature of the automated attendant voice mail module acts as a spoken bulletin board  providing information to those who require it 
a voice menu tells a caller what options are available and the caller presses touch tone keys to make a selection and hear a prerecorded message 
networking 
with the networking module  a company with multiple locations can link its offices together  thereby allowing subscribers at each location to send and receive voice messages from any other office in the network 
both industry standard audio messaging industry standard amis and proprietary avt networking protocols are supported by this module 
unified messaging applications desktop message manager 
desktop message manager provides a visual interface to the subscriber s unified mailbox for access to voice and fax messages 
the visual interface lets the subscriber know who sent a message  the type of message  when it arrived  whether it is urgent and its length 
the module will play back voice mail messages on the subscriber s telephone or voice enabled personal computer as well as display fax messages on the computer screen 
subscribers may voice annotate faxes and distribute them to other subscribers on the system 
the related message manager for exchange inbox module provides a subscriber with a graphical interface to manage his or her callxpress unified mailbox from the windows exchange inbox 
e mail access 
e mail access provides subscribers with access to their electronic mail messages by telephone 
the system provides a subscriber with the option to hear his or her electronic mail text messages through text to speech capabilities or convert them into faxes through text to fax capability 
e mail access integrates with lotus cc mail  microsoft mail and lotus notes 
future e mail access releases will integrate with other popular lan based electronic mail systems 
fax mail 
the fax mail module provides store and forward capabilities for fax documents identical to those provided for voice messages 
with fax mail  a subscriber can retrieve and print faxes from his or her mailbox hours a day  and have faxes automatically delivered to any fax machine 
call center productivity applications automated agent 
automated agent is an interactive voice response module that is programmed to provide information to callers in response to their particular inquiries 
when configured with other callxpress modules  automated agent enables complete application solutions to be designed for specific business functions  such as catalog ordering and college registration 
script manager provides an english like programming interface to develop sophisticated  customized scripts 
automated agent can be connected to the corporate database through a variety of host computer and lan based interfaces 
fax response 
the fax response module provides documents such as order acknowledgments or printouts of customer accounts requested by callers through the automated agent module 
desktop call manager 
desktop call manager provides for intelligent  real time management of incoming calls as either a call center workgroup management tool or individual productivity tool 
incoming calls are identified by either callerid or other central office provided protocol or call manager prompts  a database search performed  and a window popped to the subscriber s pc telling who is calling 
the subscriber can then decide whether to take the call  take a message  or redirect the call to someone else 
desktop call manager can be an very cost effective application for smaller  informal call centers where an acd cannot be cost justified 
faxtext 
with the faxtext module  callers have hour access to requested information such as product literature  specification sheets  rate sheets  technical bulletins or any other type of information a company wants to quickly and easily communicate via fax 
callxpress access 
callxpress access provides client server voice management tools and an application programming interface into the callxpress database 
independent software developers and value added resellers can use these tools to build voice enabled  telephone based applications 
phonexpress phonexpress is designed to meet the requirements of small to medium sized organizations that require full featured automated attendant and voice mail functions 
phonexpress is based on the same core technology as callxpress  but does not provide the application interfaces to support all of the advanced cti applications of unified messaging and call center productivity 
phonexpress is designed to support from to ports and may be optionally configured with faxtext and networking capability to provide a cost effective branch voice processing system for enterprise wide networks 
phonexpress is available as a software kit or as a completely integrated phonexpress system 
px px is designed for the small business and professional services market that requires basic voice mail and call answering 
designed for easy installation on the most popular key telephone systems  px can provide up to mailboxes and supports or ports 
rightfax the rightfax high performance  lan based fax server is designed for businesses with high fax traffic  many fax users  or where secure and confidential fax management is required 
the rightfax product consists of a server server software and fax cards and desktop clients 
desktop clients can fax documents directly from any windows application on their lan connected pc 
all fax processing is performed on the server  thereby eliminating the need for a fax modem or telephone line connected directly to each user s pc 
in addition  because the fax processing is performed on the server  the user s application merely sends the information to be faxed to the server  where all of the conversions to fax format and outbound calling and transmission are managed 
in the same paradigm as the company s telephony oriented products  rightfax users have a mailbox to receive incoming faxes 
incoming faxes can be routed to the user s mailbox in a variety of ways  including ocr optical character recognition of a cover page 
the fax is digitally stored and can be viewed on the user s pc connected to the lan or from any web browser on a pc connected to the internet 
faxes can then be printed on any printer connected to the lan or the user s pc  forwarded to other users on the rightfax server  or re faxed to any other fax machine in the world 
since the fax has been stored digitally  there is no further degradation due to multiple scannings through standalone fax machines 
rightfax servers can be configured from to fax ports and run on either the os or windows nt operating systems 
rightfax servers are compatible with all major network operating systems and are sold as either software licenses or software kits including fax cards 
sales  marketing and product support while the company s telephony oriented and computer oriented product lines have emerged from different technological origins  the two product categories are now taking on characteristics of the other  the telephony oriented product lines adding computer oriented functions and applications  and the computer oriented product lines adding telephony oriented functions and applications 
the same is true of the marketing and sales efforts and strategies of these products 
the telephony oriented and computer oriented distribution channels have emerged from different origins  but are now taking on characteristics of the other  in step with the convergence of the technologies 
the company has built large telephony oriented and computer oriented distribution channels in the united states and is aggressively developing its international distribution 
the sales concentration is very diverse  with no customer representing of sales 
domestic telephony oriented distribution the company currently derives its us telephony oriented sales revenues through an indirect channel of wholesale dealers and distributors comprised of customer premise telephone equipment cpe dealers  voice processing vp specialists  and private label oem strategic relationships 
the company has entered into distribution agreements with over domestic telephony oriented companies 
this channel consists primarily of both large and small regionally focused organizations 
the company also distributes through national telephone equipment dealers such as norstan communications corporation norstan and private label oem organizations such as dictaphone corporation developer of dictation systems and other voice related applications and mcorp developer of hospitality software for the hotel motel industry 
the company believes it has the largest telephony oriented channel capable of marketing and servicing advanced cti application products 
the company will continue to selectively recruit additional dealers and private label oem partners  focusing on those capable of marketing and servicing advanced cti application products 
dealers are required to attend initial company sponsored training sessions on system usage  installation  maintenance and customer support 
advanced training is also available from the company on an ongoing basis 
all dealers are subject to agreements with the company covering matters such as payment terms  protection of proprietary rights and nonexclusive sales territories  but these agreements generally do not restrict the dealer s ability to carry competitive products 
domestic computer oriented distribution the company derives most of its us sales of computer oriented products from an indirect channel consisting of computer oriented resellers that provide value added services  independent software vendors  and professional services companies specializing in custom systems development 
most of these computer oriented resellers are small to medium sized organizations and regionally focused 
in addition  the company markets its computer oriented products directly to end user customers through trade show participation and journal advertisement 
the company believes that as its computer oriented products become more application oriented  the sales mix will continue to shift from direct end user sales to indirect sales through the computer oriented resellers 
international distribution the international market for cti products is not as developed as the united states 
the company believes that over the next few years the market for both telephony oriented and computer oriented cti products will grow faster internationally than in the us to address this opportunity  the company is developing broad coverage of international markets through a variety of dealer  distributor  and strategic relationships 
although the company s sales to date have generally been denominated in us dollars  the company expects that in the future an increasing portion of international sales will be made in local currencies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the company s export sales for the years ended december   and to date  the majority of the company s international sales have been in english speaking countries canada  australia  new zealand  the united kingdom and south africa 
the company expects its accelerated distribution development and product localization efforts of the past few years will result in higher growth rate in non english speaking countries than the english speaking 
product localization has become more important as the company s products take on more computer oriented characteristics such as visual displays 
the voice related aspects of the company s products have had multi lingual capabilities since the late s 
the company is actively recruiting new dealers and distributors in international markets 
product support the company s dealers and distributors are primarily responsible for supporting end users of the company s products 
the company provides technical support to its dealers and distributors  most of which is telephone assistance 
telephone support service hours to dealers have been expanded to more effectively service non us customers 
the company has also expanded its technical training offerings of both telephony oriented and computer oriented products to its dealers 
the company also provides limited warranties on certain hardware components distributed in conjunction with its products  thereby permitting factory returns of defective parts within certain specified time periods following delivery 
the majority of product support is provided by the company within three months of product shipment  and the estimated cost of such support is recognized as product revenues are recorded 
the company generally charges its customers separately for post sale updates and upgrades 
product development the company maintains two product development centers  telephony oriented products in kirkland  washington and computer oriented products in tucson  arizona 
while development efforts in the past have been separate  the convergence of the technologies has allowed the company to collaborate and leverage development efforts between the two groups 
the company expects these cross development efforts to increase in the future 
telephony oriented products the callxpress core software technology provides the foundation for the callxpress  phonexpress and px products 
this use of existing technology resources has allowed the company to control research and development expenses while addressing the needs of an expanding call processing and computer telephony market 
the company has four engineering teams working in its primary product areas applications engineering  responsible for the core server based software for callxpress  phonexpress and px  integrations engineering  responsible for phone system integrations and voice and fax card integrations  desktop engineering  responsible for lan based applications  and advanced development  responsible for specialty and next generation products and features 
the company has opened a development center in pomona  california as a result of the acquisition of assets of telcom technologies in january this group will focus development efforts on call center applications such as agentxpressnt and other call center related products 
the company believes that  for its product offerings to continue to achieve acceptance  it will be necessary to continue to develop enhanced versions of its advanced cti application products as well as basic voice and call processing functions 
many of the new features and capabilities will be computer oriented 
the company also expects to expend significant research and development efforts in developing next generation technology 
computer oriented products the bulk of the company s rightfax product development efforts are focused on the nt based product line  and include advanced capabilities such as the company s recently released web client which provides management of a rightfax mailbox over the internet from any web browser 
many of the new features and capabilities will be telephony oriented 
strategic development with the international markets expected to grow at a faster rate than north america over the next several years  the company intends to continue to develop versions of its products that have been localized for foreign markets 
localization includes converting system administrator and desktop client screens  documentation  and voice prompt sets into foreign languages 
the company anticipates expending significant research and development resources to develop localized versions of its products 
while the company expects such investment in research and development will generate revenue in the next several years  technological development is always subject to potential delays and there can be no assurance that any new products or product enhancements developed by the company will achieve market acceptance 
proprietary rights avt relies on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights will be successful 
the company has filed a patent application in the united states 
while avt believes that the application relates to patentable devices and concepts  there can be no assurance that a patent will issue  or that any patent issued can be successfully defended 
the company believes that patents are of less significance in its industry than factors such as innovation  technological expertise and distribution strength 
avt has periodically received letters from third parties asserting patent rights 
following analysis  the company generally has not believed it necessary to license any of the patent rights referred to in such letters 
in those cases in which the company determined a license of patent rights was necessary  it has entered into a license agreement 
although there can be no assurance  the company believes that any necessary licenses or other rights under patents to products or features could be obtained on conditions that would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
the company licenses certain portions of its technology from third parties under written agreements  some of which contain provisions for ongoing royalty payments 
as of december   the company had license agreements with octel corporation  syntellect inc  intelligent environments  inc 
and microsoft corporation microsoft 
competition the company believes that the competitive pressures it faces in both the telephony oriented and computer oriented cti markets are likely to intensify  especially in the markets for basic functionality such as voice and call processing 
system features  product pricing  ease of use and installation  sales engineering and marketing support  and product reliability are the primary bases of competition 
the company believes that it competes favorably with respect to these factors 
while competition in the advanced cti application marketplace will also intensify  the company believes it is well positioned due to its technological leadership and strong distribution channel 
the company s principal competitors in the telephony oriented market are independent suppliers  including octel communications corporation  centigram communications corporation centigram and active voice corporation active voice 
pbx and key telephone systems manufacturers such as lucent technologies  northern telecom  rolm siemens  executone  panasonic and toshiba also compete with the company by offering integrated voice messaging systems of their own design or under various oem agreements 
in the call center market the company s principle competitors are independent suppliers  including aspect and rockwell 
pbx and key telephone systems manufacturers such as lucent technologies  northern telecom  rolm siemens and executone also compete with the company by offering integrated acd systems of their own design or under various oem agreements 
in the computer oriented market  the company s principal competitors are optus software  alcom  and cheyenne communications 
many of the company s competitors distribute their products through the same distribution channel as the company 
the company competes intensely for the loyalties and attention of its dealers  which in many cases also carry products offered by one or more of the company s competitors in addition to the company s products 
recently  the company has also began to face competition from very large software companies such as microsoft  lotus development corporation lotus and novell  inc novell  who did not traditionally compete with the company 
manufacturing the company s manufacturing operations consist primarily of diskette duplication  documentation fulfillment  final assembly  and quality control testing of materials  subassemblies and systems 
some limited hardware fabrication is performed by third parties for the company on certain telephone switch integration modules  where the company has designed a proprietary device to emulate a particular manufacturer s telephone station set  and for certain internal switching components and digital hand sets used in the company s acd products 
the company is dependent on third party manufacturers or vendors of certain critical hardware components such as personal computer chassis  keyboards  disk drives  monitors  memory modules and other miscellaneous components 
the company s products incorporate a number of commercially available application cards  fax cards  voice cards and circuit boards that enable integration with certain telephone switches 
the company currently purchases voice cards from dialogic corp  natural microsystems and mitel 
the company purchases facsimile cards from brooktrout and dialogic corp 
employees as of december   the company had full time employees  including in administration  in manufacturing  in engineering and product development  and in sales  marketing and technical support 
company employees enter into agreements containing confidentiality restrictions 
the company has never had a work stoppage and no employees are represented by a labor organization 
the company considers its employee relations to be good 
item properties the company s headquarters and administrative  engineering  manufacturing and marketing operations are located in approximately  square feet of leased space in kirkland  washington under a lease that expires in january the company s computer oriented operations are primarily located in approximately  square feet leased in tucson  arizona under a lease that expires in october the company believes that these facilities are adequate to meet its current needs and that suitable additional or alternative space will be available  as needed  in the future on commercially reasonable terms

cti encompasses a wide range of products that allow two of the most essential business instruments  telephones and personal computers pcs  to work together 
some cti products let people access and control telephone functions through a pc  others let people access and control computer functions through a telephone 
the cti market has emerged from the convergence of these two powerful and useful tools  each with a different technological origin and marketing orientation 
the company has implemented a dual pronged strategy to address the cti market developing telephony oriented products marketed through a telephony oriented distribution channel  and computer oriented products marketed through a computer oriented channel 
the telephony oriented products are callxpress  the company s premier  multi application  high capacity cti product  phonexpress  a high performance call answering and routing and voice mail system  and px  a basic voice mail and call answering system for the small business market 
the computer oriented product line is rightfax  the company s premier  high performance  lan based fax server 
these products address the needs of four segments of the cti market advanced cti applications  cti ready systems  basic messaging systems  and installed base add ons and service 
advanced cti applications products include callxpress systems sold with at least one advanced cti application module in addition to voice mail automated attendant and rightfax servers 
cti ready systems are callxpress systems sold initially with voice mail automated attendant capabilities only  but which can be easily upgraded to include advanced cti features 
the basic messaging market is addressed by the phonexpress and px products 
sales of non cti capability enhancing add ons  capacity increasing upgrades  and service parts to the installed base represent the fourth market segment 
the company s strategies are focused on addressing these market segments  and results of operations are reported accordingly 
the company acquired rightfax in january  accounting for the business combination as a purchase 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations and the percentage increase or decrease from the prior year increase decrease from year ended december  prior year vs 
vs 
net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales  general and administrative write off of purchased  in process research and development total operating expenses operating income other income  net income before income tax expense income tax expense net income net sales the company derives net sales primarily from initial sales of fully integrated systems  software kits  or software licenses to dealers and distributors and the follow on sales of capability enhancing add on software modules and capacity increasing upgrades 
the sales mix among the four market segments  as well as among product lines  and software kits and fully integrated systems  impacts both net sales and gross margin 
the company typically does not have visibility into short term changes in sales mix 
sales to dealers and distributors are recognized when the products are shipped 
years ended december  and net sales increased from million in to million in due primarily to the growth in advanced cti application products 
advanced cti application product sales increased and represented of sales as compared to of sales in in addition to the inclusion of rightfax sales for the first time  the company introduced major enhancements to both the callxpress and rightfax product lines during  which contributed to this significant growth 
in a higher percentage of callxpress systems were sold with advanced cti application modules as compared to with voice mail auto attendant functions only than in this resulted in cti ready sales declining from of sales to of sales 
the combined callxpress and rightfax product lines represented of sales as compared to in basic messaging sales of phonexpress and px were unchanged and represented of sales in  down from in this trend is consistent with the company s strategic emphasis on advanced cti applications rather than on lower margin basic messaging sales 
add on and service sales increased  representing of sales 
international sales increased in over and represented of net sales due primarily to growth in europe 
the company significantly increased its efforts to develop distribution outside the united states in to gain a foothold in the international cti marketplace which is just now emerging 
although there can be no assurance as to the rate of market acceptance of the company s products in international markets  the company expects the expanded efforts in  as well as the recently initiated efforts in germany  france and the middle east  will result in a higher rate of growth than in the united states 
years ended december  and net sales increased from million in to million in the net sales dollar growth rate was somewhat dampened by price erosion in the basic messaging market and a change in the company s product mix towards software kits as opposed to fully integrated systems which include the personal computer and computer components 
in response to price pressure at the lower end of the basic messaging market  the company introduced a fully integrated px system for distribution through its partner sprint north supply 
international sales increased in over and represented of net sales  due primarily to growth in europe 
gross profit years ended december  and gross profit as a percentage of sales improved from in to in due to the continued product mix shift towards software kits and software licenses as opposed to fully integrated systems  and growth in advanced cti application products which have a higher software content than basic messaging systems 
the company s telephony oriented products can be purchased as a fully integrated system or software kit 
the computer oriented rightfax product line is sold either as a software kit or software license 
sales of advanced cti application system units carry a higher price and gross margin than basic messaging systems due to the additional software modules purchased and tend to be a higher mix of software kits and software licenses as compared to fully integrated systems 
gross profit on basic messaging system sales in continued to be negatively impacted by price erosion and a higher ratio of fully integrated systems as compared to advanced cti application systems 
while the company expects additional competition to enter the advanced cti application marketplace  the favorable mix shift from basic messaging to advanced cti applications  which carry significantly higher margins  will help offset the effects of price erosion 
years ended december  and gross profit as a percentage of sales improved from in to in  due primarily to the significant increase in software kit mix versus fully integrated systems and increased callxpress advanced application sales 
these favorable trends were partially offset by two factors in the lower end of the basic messaging market price erosion and the packaging requirements of the sprint north supply distribution agreement  which includes px software fully integrated on a pc 
research and development years ended december  and research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  due to the addition of software development and quality assurance personnel associated with the computer oriented rightfax product line and the accelerated development of callxpress release  several callxpress advanced cti modules  and other advanced development projects 
accordingly  research and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased from in to in the company expects to continue to increase research and development spending significantly in to further capitalize on opportunities in cti applications and international localization 
see item business product development 
in addition  the company recognized a nonrecurring charge of million in for the write off of purchased  in process research and development associated with the acquisition of rightfax in january the remaining intangibles resulting from this acquisition are being amortized over seven years 
years ended december  and research and development expenses increased to million in  due primarily to the addition of engineering and quality assurance personnel needed to support the advanced cti application modules and lan integrations 
excluding expenses recognized in that represented the remainder of unamortized purchased technology arising from a acquisition  research and development expenses would have increased over selling  general and administrative years ended december  and selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to the company s expanded distribution efforts in the computer oriented channel resulting from the acquisition of rightfax  as well as significant increases in the telephony oriented worldwide sales management organization and expanded marketing programs 
selling  general and administrative costs accordingly increased from of sales in to of sales in years ended december  and selling  general and administrative expenses were essentially flat at million in and million in lower incentive and bad debt accruals were offset by increased international distribution development efforts and additional regulatory  reporting and administrative requirements associated with being a public company 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in as the company was able to utilize personnel additions and expenditures made in previous years 
other income years ended december  and other income decreased from million in to million in because cash and investment balances declined in early as a result of payments made related to the acquisition of rightfax 
the company s mix of tax exempt investments as compared with taxable investments was unchanged throughout years ended december  and other income increased significantly from million in to million in due primarily to interest earned on cash resulting from the company s december initial public offering 
income tax expense years ended december  and the company s effective tax rate increased from in to in excluding the effect of the nondeductible  nonrecurring charge for the write off of purchased  in process research and development discussed above 
the increase was due primarily to the effect of us state and foreign income and franchise taxes 
the company expects the effective tax rate in to be approximately 
years ended december  and the company s effective tax rate increased from in to in the remaining valuation allowance associated with research and experimentation credit carryforwards was recognized as a tax benefit in in addition  a portion of cash investments was reallocated from taxable to tax exempt instruments in  thereby reducing interest income and the effective tax rate 
net income and earnings per share years ended december  and net income excluding the nonrecurring charge increased from million in to million in earnings per share excluding the nonrecurring charge increased from in to in including the nonrecurring charge  net income in was million and earnings per share was

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased from million at december  to million at december  cash flow generated from operating activities increased from million in to million in due to improved receivables collections and profitable operations 
in february  the company prepaid the remaining balance due under a royalty agreement associated with a business combination consummated in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the cash disbursement  which amounted to million  was recorded as an intangible asset and has been amortized over the remaining term of the original royalty agreement  approximately six years 
in addition  the company amended a license agreement in september  prepaying its remaining royalty obligation by issuing a note in the amount of million payable in equal quarterly installments of  including imputed interest at 
the related intangible asset is being amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining life of the patents  approximately years 
in january  the company acquired cracchiolo and feder  inc d b a rightfax for million in cash plus  shares of the company s common stock 
the business combination was accounted for as a purchase 
approximately million of the purchase price was recognized as a nonrecurring charge in the first quarter of representing purchased  in process research and development 
the remaining intangible assets are being amortized over seven years from date of acquisition 
in addition  the company paid million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock in  relating to the earn out and guaranteed value of the company s common stock 
as a result of the earn out  the company recorded an additional million of goodwill at december  the former shareholders of rightfax will be further entitled to receive additional consideration worth million in a combination of cash and the company s common stock over the next two years  if certain revenue and profit margin goals are achieved by rightfax 
the company amended a license agreement in july  prepaying its remaining royalty obligation by issuing a noninterest bearing note in the amount of  which was completely paid prior to december  the related intangible asset is being amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining lives of the patents  approximately seven years 
at december   the company had a million unsecured revolving line of credit  none of which was outstanding 
the company s line of credit expires in may and contains certain financial covenants and restrictions as to various matters  all of which the company is currently in compliance with 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate or its interbank offering rate plus  at the company s option 
the company invested million in equipment and leasehold improvements in as compared to million in equipment purchases in both years consisted primarily of computer hardware and software 
the company expects to spend less than million in on property  plant and equipment 
the company expects that its current cash  cash flow from operations  and available bank line of credit will provide sufficient working capital for operations for at least the next year 
subsequent events in january  the company acquired selected assets and liabilities of telcom technologies  inc  a developer of nt based open architecture automatic call distribution acd systems 
the purchase price for the acquisition was million in cash  plus warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock exercisable at per share  which may be exercised at any time prior to january  the company will account for the business combination as a purchase and expects to recognize a nonrecurring charge of million in the first quarter representing the value of purchased  in process research and development acquired 
certain trends and uncertainties when used in this discussion  the words believes  anticipates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
factors which could affect the company s financial results are described below and in item business of this annual report on form k 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrences of unanticipated events 
the company s quarterly results of operations are subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including the timing of customer orders  changes in the product and distribution channel sales mix  introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  pricing pressures and general economic conditions 
because substantially all of the company s revenues in each quarter result from orders received in that quarter  the company has historically operated with little or no backlog 
the company establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on its expected revenues  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  variations in the timing and or mix of sales can cause significant variations in quarterly results of operations 
in addition  while the company s sales to date have been generally denominated in us dollars  the company is now actively marketing its products in certain foreign countries in local currencies
