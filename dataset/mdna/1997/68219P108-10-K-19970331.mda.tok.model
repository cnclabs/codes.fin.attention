cost of product revenue decreased as a percentage of total revenue from in to in as catalog revenue decreased as a percentage of total revenue in both and the four editions of the editors choice catalog published in were similar in breadth of product offering to the four editions published in the revenue growth of the other product offerings of the company significantly outpaced the growth of catalog revenue  as the catalog had substantially reached its mature revenue level per edition 
cost of product revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue from in to in this increase was primarily due to a  elimination of profit for inventory previously sold to technocom  plc  prior to the company s acquisition of their lan software business  a million inventory write down related to the restructuring in the third quarter of  and an increase in product sales from to as part of the company s restructuring plan and reorganization of its operations  the company has decreased its emphasis on the e mail business and certain catalog products and has ceased to market  sell  develop  and support other product lines

the product sales related increase was consistent as a percentage of total revenue from to sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense primarily consists of compensation paid to sales and marketing personnel  the costs of direct mail and telemarketing campaigns  and the costs of product trials requested by potential customers 
sales and marketing expense also includes the costs of administering the catalog operation  the costs of public relations  trade shows and conferences  and the telephone and information technology costs associated with sales activities 
sales and marketing expense increased as a percentage of total revenue from in excluding the impact of the deferred revenue to in due principally to the company s investment in its telemarketing organization in north carolina 
sales and marketing expense decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenue from in to in this slight decrease is a result of the restructuring of the company  offset by the additional sales personnel required to support the growth in the customer base  the costs associated with the company s marketing efforts of existing products  the beginning of on technology uk ltd 
s marketing programs in europe  and the launch of the company s new firewall product  on guard 
the company anticipates that sales and marketing expense will continue to increase in absolute dollars as the company continues to expand direct marketing efforts  but that sales and marketing expense will remain consistent or decrease as a percentage of total revenue 
research and development expense 
research and development expense includes costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products  and costs associated with providing technical support 
research and development expense decreased as a percentage of total revenue from in to in primarily as a result of increased licensing of third party network management software products which more than offset the cost of continued development of incomplete products acquired from davinci in research and development expense increased as a percentage of total revenue from in to in this increase in absolute dollars was primarily related to the increase in the size of the product portfolio  the associated costs of product development  enhancements and maintenance  and the additional costs associated with the company s acquisitions of netrend corporation and leprechaun software international  ltd 
in the first quarter of the company plans to continue to make significant investments in research and development 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense includes executive compensation  executive support costs  accounting operations  planning  and business development operations 
general and administrative expense increased in absolute dollars from million in to million in due to personnel growth and associated costs  and decreased as a percentage of total revenue from in to in general and administrative expense increased in absolute dollars from million in to million in and as a percentage of sales from in to in the increase reflects personnel growth and associated costs in general support areas including costs associated with the company s acquisition of the lan software business from technocom plc in the first quarter of  resulting in the newly formed on technology uk ltd  and the related expenses of administering that office

in connection with the acquisition of davinci in  the company allocated million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects 
in connection with the acquisitions of netrend corporation  leprechaun software international  ltd 
and the lan software business from technocom plc in  the company allocated an aggregate of million of the respective purchase prices to incomplete research and development projects 
these costs were expensed as of the acquisition dates and the allocations represent the estimated fair values related to the incomplete projects determined by independent appraisals using appropriate assumptions and valuation techniques 
the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the technology had no alternative future use 
the technology acquired in these acquisitions have required substantial additional development by the company 
charge for restructuring 
on august   the company announced that it had implemented a reorganization of its operations and a restructuring plan the plan 
the plan included write offs and writedowns of certain assets  including accruing the costs related to a significant reduction in the company s work force  primarily in the technical support and sales and marketing departments  and the de emphasis of certain product lines  resulting in a non recurring charge of million 
included in the plan was an inventory writedown of million which is included in cost of product revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  classification of inventory markdowns and other costs associated with a restructuring 
the following are the significant components of the million charge for restructuring employee severance  benefits and related costs write off and writedown of assets to net realizable value excluding inventory provision for lease loss and related costs in closing facility 
the employee severance  benefits and related costs includes the costs associated with the involuntary termination of approximately employees which was approved as part of the plan  and communicated to the affected employees on the day the restructuring was announced  august  all employee service required to earn or qualify for the benefits accrued for had been rendered at august  the writedown of assets to net realizable value includes the write off of certain assets for which there is no future economic benefit to the company

 revenue net product revenue other revenue total revenue operating expenses cost of product revenue sales and marketing research and development general and administrative charge for purchased r d charge for restructuring income loss from operations interest expense income  net net income loss before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes 
net income loss historically  revenues in the first quarter have been lower than in the preceding fourth quarter due to customer budgeting and purchasing patterns 
the company s results of operations have been and may in the future be subject to significant quarterly fluctuations 
these fluctuations may be due to a variety of factors  including the timing of significant orders  the timing of the introduction or announcement of new or enhanced products by the company or its competitors  variations in net revenue by product and distribution channel  increased price and other competition  capital spending patterns of end users  delays in shipping new or existing products  conditions within the software and networking industries  and economic conditions generally 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations to date primarily through cash flow from operations and private and public placements of capital stock 
at december    and the company had available cash and cash equivalents of million  million and million  respectively  and working capital of million  million and million  respectively 
on april   the company acquired a new line of credit with a commercial bank for million that allows the company to borrow up to the lesser of million or the sum of of qualified domestic accounts receivable and of qualified foreign accounts receivable 
borrowings bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
the line expires april  advances pursuant to the line of credit are secured by liens granted on the company s accounts receivables 
at december   and  the company did not have an outstanding balance under the line of credit agreement 
net cash provided by used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million   and  respectively 
in  net cash provided by operating activities consisted of a million net loss which was the result of a million charge for incomplete research and development relating to the acquisition of davinci  a million increase in accounts receivable  a  increase in direct marketing costs and a million decrease in deferred revenue offset by an increase of million in accounts payable  million in accrued expenses and million in the reserve for distributor inventory 
the increase in the reserve for distributor inventory represents the company s estimate of product paid for by distributors that will be returned 
in  net cash used in operating activities consisted of approximately million of net income from operations  a  decrease in accrued expenses  a  decrease in accounts payable  a million increase in accounts receivable  a  decrease in reserve for distributor inventory  and a million increase in inventories 
the increase in inventories was due primarily to new product introductions  increased stocking levels as a result of increased revenue and related unit shipments  and procedures put in place by the company during to help ensure more complete availability of product in stock 
in  net cash used in operating activities consisted of approximately million net loss from operations which was the result of a million charge for incomplete research and development relating to the acquisitions of leprechaun software international  ltd  netrend corporation and the lan software business from technocom  plc  a million charge for restructuring  depreciation and amortization of million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and increase in prepaid assets of million 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was million   and million  respectively 
this primarily reflects purchases of property and equipment of  million  and million  respectively  and direct costs of the acquisition of davinci of million in and of leprechaun software international  ltd  netrend corporation  and the lan software business from technocom plc of  million  and million  respectively 
while the company expects capital expenditures to increase as revenue and the number of employees increases  there are currently no plans to change the company s current pattern of investment in property and development on either a long or short term basis 
net cash used in provided by financing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
in  this was the result of multiple private placements of capital stock of million  borrowings under the line of credit of  payments under the line of credit of million and principal repayments on obligations of capital leases of  in  this was a result of principal repayments on obligations of capital leases of  and million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the initial public offering in august in  this was a result of principal repayments on obligations of capital leases of million and the purchase of treasury stock of million 
on january   the company acquired the stock of purview technologies  inc  a development stage company engaged in internet usage monitoring software development 
the company paid million in cash and issued  shares of its common stock 
the aggregate purchase price including estimated direct acquisition costs was approximately million 
this transaction will be accounted for as a purchase in accordance with apb no 
on january   the company acquired the stock of csd software gmbh  a german developer and marketer of pc desktop software management tools 
the company paid million in cash and issued  shares of its common stock 
the aggregate purchase price including estimated direct acquisition costs was approximately million 
this transaction will be accounted for as a purchase in accordance with apb no 
for each of these acquisitions  the company is in the process of obtaining independent appraisals to value the intangible assets acquired including incomplete purchased research and development 
the company anticipates that a substantial portion of the purchase price for these two acquisitions will be charged to operations as purchased incomplete research and development 
the company believes that its existing cash balances  funds generated from operations  and available borrowings under its line of credit will be sufficient to finance the company s operations for the next months 
in the event the company acquires one or more businesses or products  the company s capital requirements could increase substantially  and there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
certain factors that may affect future results some statements contained in this form k that are not historical statements including but not limited to  statements concerning estimates of future revenues  operating expense levels and such operating levels relative to the company s total revenues constitute forward looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the risk factors discussed below  among other factors including the accuracy of the company s internal estimates of revenue and operating expense level and the other risk factors disclosed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commissions  may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the estimated results stated in such forward looking statements 
variability of quarterly operating results the company s licensing activity and results of operations can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
causes of such fluctuations may include  among other factors the volume and timing of new and repeat orders  the introduction or announcement of new products or product enhancements by on or third parties  failure to ship trials  changes in response rates to the company s mailings and telemarketing programs  interruption in the company s overnight delivery  telephone or internal networks and databases  work stoppages  changes in product prices  changes in operating expenses  changes in product mix  increase in international sales as a percentage of total revenue  seasonality  trends in the computer industry  unavailability of product  potential software viruses and perceived threats thereof  customer order deferrals  general economic conditions  extraordinary events such as acquisitions or litigation and the occurrence of unexpected events 
while to date  the company has not experienced any significant failure to ship trials  work stoppages or unavailability of products  there can be no assurance any of such events will not occur in the future 
the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
because of the nature of its distribution methods  the company has virtually no backlog and generally cannot predict when users will license products 
historically  repeat orders have accounted for a significant portion of the company s total revenue  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain current repeat order rates in the future 
furthermore  since the company s cost of total revenue is relatively low and its operating expenses are relatively fixed  any revenue shortfall in a quarter will result in a substantially similar shortfall in net income 
in addition  significant quarterly fluctuations in licensing activity will cause significant fluctuations in the company s cash flows and the cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and deferred revenue accounts on the company s balance sheet 
the company s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality  due in part to customer buying patterns 
in recent years  the company generally has had greater demand for its products in the fourth quarter and has had weaker demand for its products during the first quarter 
these fluctuations are caused primarily by customer budgeting and purchasing patterns 
the company believes this pattern will continue 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
risks associated with rapid technological change the communications and network management software markets are characterized by rapid technological developments  changes in customer requirements  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the company s future success will depend  in part  upon its ability to enhance its existing applications  develop and introduce new products that take advantage of technological advances  and respond promptly to new customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
while the company believes that it currently offers a broad product line in the communications and network management software markets  these markets are continuing to evolve and customer requirements are continuing to change 
in response to these changes the company believes that it will need to continue to expand its product offerings 
the company has identified a number of enhancements to its existing products offerings which it believes are important to its continued success in the communications and network management software markets  including products for windows and windows nt and internet enabling products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely basis  enhancements to its existing products or new products  or that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
failure by the company in any of these areas could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  from time to time the company or its competitors may announce new products with capabilities or technologies that could have a potential to replace or shorten the life cycles of the company s existing products or render such products obsolete 
there can be no assurance that announcements by the company or its competitors of new products will not cause customers to defer purchasing the company s existing products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that future changes in dos  windows  netware or other popular operating systems would not result in incompatibility with the company s products 
the company s failure to introduce new products on a timely basis that are compatible with operating systems and environments preferred by desktop computer users would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competitive risks the market for the company s products is highly competitive  and the company expects competition to increase in the future 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for its products include performance  functionality  ease of use  ease of installation  quality  customer support  breadth or product line  speed of product delivery  frequency of upgrades and updates  brand name recognition  company reputation and price 
certain of the criteria upon which the performance and quality of the company s communications and network management software compete include speed of response  ease of use  ease of installation  interoperability with other messaging systems and simplicity of administration 
the company believes that it generally competes favorably with respect to each of these factors  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
certain of the company s competitors have been in the market longer than the company  and other competitors are larger and may have greater name recognition that the company 
as is the case in many segments of the software industry  the company may encounter increasing price competition in the future 
this could reduce average selling prices and  therefore  profit margins 
competitive pressures could result not only in sustained price reductions but also in a decline in sales volume  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete effectively against existing and potential competitors in the communications and network management software markets  many of whom have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and support resources and name recognition than the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that software vendors who currently use traditional distribution methods will not be in the future decide to compete more directly with the company by utilizing free trial marketing 
see risks associated with free trial marketing 
both the communications software market and the network management software market are highly fragmented  with products offered by many vendors 
in the e mail market  the company competes with offerings from software  shareware and freeware developers 
shareware is software that is made available electronically on bulletin boards systems 
shareware users are encouraged to evaluate the software for a short period of time and then either cease using it or pay a license fee 
in the group scheduling market  the company also competes with personal information manager products pims that have been enhanced to include some group scheduling features 
certain competitors have in the past bundled communications and network management software with their operating system products or software application suite offerings and have publicly announced  or the company believes are likely to provide  such bundles with future offerings 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to compete effectively against communications software which is included free with the operating system  as these bundled products are improved in the future 
in addition  the trend toward enterprise wide communications software solutions may result in a consolidation of the communications software market around a smaller number of vendors who are able to provide all of the necessary software and support capabilities 
historically  the company s international revenue has been generated primarily through independent distributors in europe  australia  israel  south africa and south america  certain of which are bound by contracts with the company but which generally do not represent the company exclusively 
the competitive environment for communications software tools internationally is similar to that in north america 
the company has only recently begun to compete in asian markets  which have significantly lagged behind north america and europe in their adoption of lan technology 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in international markets 
the widespread inclusion of the functionality of the company s products as standard features of operating systems software could render the company s products obsolete and unmarketable  particularly if the quality of such functionality were comparable to that of the company s products 
if the company were unable to develop new communications and network management software to further enhance operating systems and to replace successfully any obsolete products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
risks associated with product development the company has in the past experienced delays in software development  and there can be no assurance that it will not experience further delays in connection with its current or future product development activities 
the company puts all of its products through alpha and beta test cycles and makes significant efforts to debug all products before commercial release 
the company makes well marked alpha and beta versions of its software available for evaluation and testing and solicits and responds to input from evaluators 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s products will not contain undetected errors or version compatibility issues  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance 
delays and difficulties associated with new product introductions or product enhancements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to developing new products  the company s internal development staff is focused on developing upgrades and updates to existing products and modifying  enhancing and completing any acquired products and incomplete projects 
future enhancements may  among other things  include additional functionality  respond to user problems or address issues of compatibility with changing operating systems and environments 
the company believes that the ability to provide these enhancements to users frequently and at a low cost is key to its success 
failure to release such enhancements on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operation 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts 
the company licenses softrack a from third party 
the license will expire december if the company believes that a licensed product continues to be valuable after the expiration of the initial license term  it will seek to extend the term of the license 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend the term of expiring licenses  or that the economic arrangements for such extensions would be comparable to the arrangements in effect during the initial license term 
risks of inclusion of communications software and network management software in system software and application suites in the future  vendors of operating system software and group of applications sold for a single price generally referred to as application suites may continue to enhance their products to include certain functions that are currently provided most often by communications and network management software or may bundle these products in their application suites at no additional charge 
the widespread inclusion of the functions provided by the company s products as standard features of operating system software could  particularly if the quality of such functions were comparable to that of the company s products  render the company s products obsolete and unmarketable 
furthermore  even if the communications and network management software functions provided as standard features by operating systems are more limited than that of the company s products  there is no assurance that a significant number of customers would not elect to accept such functions in lieu of purchasing additional software 
if the company were unable to develop new communications software and network management software products to further enhance operating systems and to replace successfully any obsolete products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on emergence of network management software the market for the company s network management software is new and evolving  and its growth depends upon the broader market acceptance of network management software 
in addition  there are a number of potential approaches to the market  including incorporating network management software into network operating systems 
therefore  even if network management software products gain broader market acceptance  there can be no assurance that the company s products will be chosen by organizations which acquire network management software 
moreover  a change in the licensing policies of microsoft or other software vendors which changes the basis on which concurrent users are measured or priced could adversely effect the company s network management software products 
furthermore  to the extent that the network management software market does develop  the company expects that competition will increase 
see competitive risks  and risks of inclusion of communications software and network management software in system software and application suites 
risks associated with free trial marketing the company provides its customers with day free trials of all of the company s principal products free trial marketing 
the trials are full featured versions of the product that are internally designed to cease operation in days 
the company uses free trial marketing as its primary sales channel 
the company depends on direct mail  trade shows and telemarketing to find prospects and install trials 
this model represents a significant departure from marketing strategies relying on a direct sales force  exclusive distributor relationships and magazine space advertising 
while to date this marketing strategy has successfully resulted in the licensing of the company s products by corporate  government and institutional users  given the relatively unproven nature of this form of marketing  there can be no assurance that this strategy will continue to be effective in the future for either current or new products 
the failure of this strategy to continue to effectively generate license revenue would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
while the company has experienced significant growth over the past years  the company s distribution strategy may make its products less attractive to customers who prefer to purchase through traditional channels and  as a result  may have the effect of limiting the company s potential market 
in addition  as mailings are mailed repeatedly to the same customers  customers responsiveness to particular offers and products declines 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain current response rates to its mailings in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company can continue to create sufficient attractive offers and to introduce interesting products at a rate sufficient to support the company s growth plan or even current revenue 
the company s growth depends both on its ability to select names from rented lists and to grow its house list 
the availability and relevance of rentable names to the company s products are not certain 
in addition  since the ability of the company to grow its house list is dependent on the supply of rentable names  house list growth cannot be assured 
the company depends on the distribution of free trial marketing disks to accomplish much of its marketing 
if some of the company s free trial marketing disks were to become infected with a computer virus  they would cause difficulties for prospects and could damage the company s reputation 
the company does extensive testing for viruses 
the company s use of outside fulfillment contractors increases the risk that a virus could be shipped undetected on disks bearing the company s label 
there can be no assurance that on would be able to collect adequate compensation from such fulfillment contractors if such a virus infected disks bearing the company s label 
the company fulfills orders received directly from customers through a third party fulfillment contractor  which warehouses the company s products and ships them directly to on s customers 
the company also maintains a private use prospects list at a bonded third party database firm 
in the event that either the customer fulfillment contractor or the private use database firm experience a substantial business interruption  whether through business failure or interruption or some natural calamity  or the company s relationship with either of such parties is terminated for any reason  the company s ability to continue to mail free trial offers to prospective customers and to fulfill orders placed by customers would be adversely affected 
in both the domestic and international markets  increases in postal rates including modifications in the classification of mail or telephone rates  or changes in postage or telephone regulations which prohibit unsolicited direct mail or unsolicited telephone calls  could significantly impact the economics of the company s free trial marketing strategy 
in addition  it is possible that other software vendors could adopt all or parts of the company s strategy and compete more directly or effectively with the company 
risks associated with potential acquisitions the company may in the future undertake additional acquisitions that could present challenges to the company s management  such as integrating and incorporating new operations  product lines  technologies and personnel 
if the company s management is unable to manage these challenges  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
any acquisition  depending on its size  could result in significant dilution to the company s stockholders 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any acquired products will gain acceptance in the company s markets 
risks of indirect channels of distribution the company markets its products through distributors and resellers in addition to its free trial marketing strategy 
these distributors and resellers also sell other products that are complementary to  or compete with  those of on 
there can be no assurance that these distributors and resellers will not give greater priority to products of other suppliers 
they have no long term obligation to purchase products from the company 
since the company s agreements with its distributors provide for a right of return  revenue recognized upon sales to distributors is subject to a reserve for returns 
although management believes that the current reserve balance is adequate to cover this exposure  there can be no assurance that any future period reserves for returns will be adequate 
in addition  the company may be unaware of the nature and scope of the representations made to customers by these distributors and resellers 
for example  they could make representations to customers about the company s current and future products which are inaccurate or incomplete 
this could result in the products not meeting the customers expectations or requirements 
although the company s agreements with its distributors generally provide the company with recourse against unauthorized action taken by the distributors  there can be no assurance that the company could recover adequate compensation to cover the damage caused by an inaccurate representation 
see risks associated with international revenue 
risks associated with protection of proprietary technology the company s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary software technology 
the company relies on a combination of contractual rights  trademarks  trade secrets and copyrights to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its software 
the company has not to date registered any of its copyrights 
the company has obtained registrations in the united states for the following trademarks on technology  notework  meeting maker  on technology design  on location  instant update and davinci systems 
the company uses a printed shrink wrap license for users of its products distributed through traditional distribution channels in order to protect its copyrights and trade secrets in those products 
since these shrink wrap licenses are not signed by the licensee  many authorities believe that they may not be enforceable under many state laws and the laws of many foreign jurisdictions 
if such licenses are not enforceable  the user would not be bound by the terms thereof  including the terms which seek to protect the company s proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that the company s proprietary technology will be protected by the use of the printed shrink wrap licenses 
if the printed shrink wrap licenses prove to be unenforceable  this may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries either do not protect the company s proprietary rights or offer only limited protection for those rights 
furthermore  the company has obtained only four foreign registrations of its notework mark and two foreign registrations of its meeting maker mark  due to the significant costs involved in obtaining foreign registrations 
as a result  the company may not be able to prevent a third party from using its trademarks in many foreign jurisdictions 
if such licenses are not enforceable  the user would not be bound by the terms thereof  including the terms which seek to protect the company s proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary software technology will be adequate to deter misappropriation of this technology 
in addition  the company does provide customer support to unlicensed users during the free trial marketing period 
lesser sensitivity by corporate  government or institutional users to avoiding copyright infringement could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
while the company to date has not taken any legal action to enforce its intellectual property rights against infringing users  it believes  based upon current interpretations of law  that its use of free trial marketing and the widespread availability of its trials do not significantly impact its ability to enforce its intellectual property rights against infringing users  including corporate  institutional and government entities

such a ruling would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights of technology companies  although  to date  the company has not been subject to any such litigation 
although the company does not believe that it is infringing the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that such claims  if asserted  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  as the company may acquire or license a portion of the software included in its future products from third parties  its exposure to infringement actions may increase because the company must rely upon such third parties for information as to the origin and ownership of any software being acquired 
the company generally obtains representations as to the origin and ownership of such acquired or licensed software and generally obtains indemnification to cover any breach of such representations 
however  there can be no assurance that such representations are accurate or that such indemnification will provide adequate compensation for a breach of such representations 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect trade secrets and other intellectual property rights owned by the company 
the company may also be subject to litigation to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be costly and cause diversion of management s attention  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations

further  in countries with a high incidence of software piracy  the company may experience a higher rate of piracy of its products 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s international revenue is generated through independent distributors and resellers 
since these distributors and resellers are not employees of the company and are not required to offer the company s products exclusively  there can be no assurance that they will continue to market the company s products 
also  despite the company s substantial dependence in the international market upon the marketing  sales and customer support of its distributors and resellers  the company currently has limited control over its distributors and resellers  and the company may be unaware of the nature and scope of the representations made to customers by these agents 
for example  independent agents could make representations to customers about the company s current and future products which are inaccurate or incomplete  which could result in the products not meeting customers expectations or requirements 
dependence upon key personnel the company s success depends to a significant extent upon a number of key technical and management employees

risley  platzman  batson  bogdan  rizzi and o sullivan are generally not otherwise subject to employment agreements or noncompetition covenants 
the loss of the services of any of the company s key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operation 
the company does not maintain life insurance policies on key employees

competition in the software industry for such personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in retaining its existing key personnel and in attracting and retaining the personnel it requires

in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume trading volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market price of many technology companies and has often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
this volatility may adversely effect the market price of the company s common stock

this action was designed to consolidate the three acquisitions the company made during the first quarter ended march   to decrease the company s emphasis on mature products  such as e mail  and to better focus the company s resources on bringing new products to the rapidly changing network management software market 
there can be no assurance that these objectives will be achieved 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will not engage in further reorganizations or restructurings in the future
