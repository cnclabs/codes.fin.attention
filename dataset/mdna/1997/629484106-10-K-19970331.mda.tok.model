effective july   the company s participation in the other liability business produced by the pools increased to from effective july  nymagic net premiums written by line of business year ended december  in thousands ocean marine    inland marine    aircraft    other liability    other total    nymagic net premiums earned by line of business year ended december in thousands ocean marine    inland marine    aircraft    other liability    other total    unlike many types of property and casualty insurance  ocean marine  inland marine  aviation and other liability premium rates are not strictly regulated by governmental authorities 
consequently  the company is able to adjust premium rates quickly in response to competition  varying degrees of risk and other factors 
in addition  the company  by virtue of its underwriting flexibility  is able to emphasize specific lines of business in response to advantageous premium rates and the anticipation of positive underwriting results 
the company s general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense  employee benefits and rental expense for office facilities 
the company s policy acquisition costs include brokerage commissions and premium taxes and are primarily based on a percentage of premiums written 
such costs have generally changed in proportion with changes in premium volume 
losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in connection with insurance claims in any particular year depend upon a variety of factors including the rate of inflation  accident or claim frequency  the occurrence of natural catastrophes and the number of policies written 
the company estimates reserves each year based upon  and in conformity with  the factors discussed under business reserves 
the company maintains a conservative policy for establishing reserves  especially in the year a policy is written 
changes in estimates of reserves are reflected in operating results in the year in which the change occurs 
as compared to the company s net premiums earned decreased by in as compared to the decline primarily relates to the inland marine and other liability lines of business 
the inland marine line recorded the largest decline in earned premiums at 
this is consistent with the company s plan in to withdraw from writing the larger multi location assureds 
after several years of unprofitable results caused by large catastrophe losses and expensive reinsurance  the company limited its writings to those that are ancillary to its ocean marine risks 
negative premiums written for occurred as a consequence of purchasing reinsurance to cover the run off of the prior year s catastrophe oriented business still in force in in  the company s strategy in this line should remain consistent with the other liability earned premiums decreased as compared the prior year 
due to fierce competition in this line  casualty market rates remain soft 
the company will continue to selectively underwrite in this line  as it has over the past several years  and premiums in are expected to further decline 
the ocean marine line recorded the largest growth in written and earned premiums among the company s various lines of business 
an and increase over the prior year s written and earned premium  respectively  was achieved by additional production in the hull and cargo classes of business coupled with changes in the ocean marine reinsurance program 
gross premiums are down slightly as rate reductions in various marine classes have outweighed the additional production in the hull and cargo classes 
rates in the ocean marine line have softened as competition intensifies 
reinsurance changes in the company s hull  cargo and energy classes have enabled it to retain more premium income without sustaining much additional exposure 
the premiums could decrease as a result of this underwriting climate 
although net earned premiums in the aviation line remained flat when compared to  gross and net writings decreased and  respectively 
was a peak year for aviation rates after insurers suffered several years of losses 
as industry gross losses improved in  competition intensified and rates subsequently softened 
as a casualty of this competitive rate environment  certain accounts were not renewed in and thereby contributed to the overall decline 
the company expects this competitive environment to remain in losses and loss adjustment expenses as a percentage of premiums earned were in as compared to in improved net loss experience in the company s core ocean and aviation lines contributed to the overall decline 
although the inland loss ratio in was adversely affected by severe weather experienced during the past winter season  such ratio improved as compared to the prior year

investment yields decreased on the company s fixed maturity portfolio due to both market conditions and a greater investment in tax exempt securities which was applied against a larger investment asset base 
policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net premiums earned for the year ended december  was as compared to for the prior year 
the inland marine line has the largest acquisition ratio among the company s various lines of business 
reductions in inland premium writings in had the effect of decreasing policy acquisition costs and the overall ratio 
interest expense increased by in primarily as a result of an increase in loan principal outstanding 
general and administrative expenses remained flat as compared with the prior year as a result of continuing efforts to contain personnel costs and cost effective reductions in administrative expenses 
realized investment gains for the year ended december  amounted to  and result primarily from the sale of appreciated equity securities 
net income increased by to  for the year ended december   from  for the prior year 
net income per share increased to in as compared to in unrealized appreciation of investments as of december  included gross unrealized gains and losses on equity securities of  and  respectively  and gross unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities held for sale of  and  respectively

the ocean marine line recorded the largest growth in written premiums among the company s various lines of business with an increase over the prior year 
additional accounts within the marine liability class of this line contributed to the overall increase 
rates in this line have started to soften as competition intensifies 
the aviation line recorded a increase in earned premiums primarily as a result of rates remaining firm on those accounts with poor loss records 
as saw an improvement in industry gross losses  rates softened on those accounts with good records 
in addition  certain unprofitable accounts were not renewed 
the inland marine line recorded the largest growth in earned premiums at despite an drop in premiums written 
during  the company curtailed inland marine production to reduce its exposure to property catastrophe losses 
as a result of unprofitable underwriting results  the company decided to withdraw from writing the larger multi location assureds 
rate increases obtained in the latter half of  a large portion of which remained unearned in  became earned in and accounted for the large increase in earned premiums over the prior year 
the other liability earned premiums decreased when compared to the prior year

in  the company also sustained another large property catastrophe loss from hurricane luis amounting to gross losses of million and net losses of million 
the aviation line improved as severity losses decreased from the record levels in and premiums remained strong for most of commission income  consisting primarily of reinsurance profit commissions and insurance pool profit and management commissions charged to members of the insurance pools other than new york marine  increased in increases in reinsurance contingent commissions resulting from profitable underwriting in various ocean marine and aviation classes of business was offset  in part  by a decrease in management commission from non affiliated members of the insurance pools as a result of their declining participation and a decline in gross premiums in the pools

additional cash flow from operations contributed to a larger asset base and increased investments in taxable securities accounted for the overall increase 
policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net premiums earned for the year ended december  was as compared to for the prior year 
in premiums earned included large increases in the aviation and inland marine lines of business 
these lines of business utilize excess of loss reinsurance which has the effect of reducing premiums without a corresponding reduction in policy acquisition costs 
consequently  this ratio increased since both the aviation and inland marine lines have greater acquisition costs as a percentage of net premiums earned than other lines of business 
interest expense decreased by in primarily as a result of a decrease in average loan principal outstanding  however offset by increases in short term interest rates 
general and administrative expenses decreased by from the prior year as a result of a decline in personnel and reductions in bad debt write offs

the primary sources of the company s liquidity are funds generated from insurance premiums  investment income and maturing or liquidating investments 
historically  cash provided by operating activities was used in investing and financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities increased in  but declined in cash outflows from increased loss payments on the company s maturing book of casualty business and catastrophe losses in  and were offset by increased cash received on premiums written in and as premiums declined in  so did cash from operations

nymagic s principal source of cash flow is dividends from its insurance company subsidiaries which is used to fund operating expenses  including interest expense  loan repayments and payment of dividends to shareholders 
the company s insurance company subsidiaries are limited by statute in the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid during a year 
the limitation restricts dividends paid or declared to the lower of of policyholders surplus or of net investment income as defined under new york insurance law

in october   the fasb issued its statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas is effective for years beginning after december  and establishes new accounting standards and reporting requirements for stock based compensation arrangements 
companies may choose between valuation method based on fair value or the existing accounting may be used under the accounting principles board s apb opinion no 
the company has elected to remain under the existing accounting requirements of apb opinion no 
 however  the necessary disclosure requirements under sfas are included in inflation periods of inflation have prompted the pools  and consequently the company  to react quickly to actual or potential imbalances between costs  including claim expenses  and premium rates 
these imbalances have been corrected mainly through improved underwriting controls  responsive management information systems and frequent review of premium rates and loss experience 
inflation also affects the final settlement costs of claims which may not be paid for several years 
the longer a claim takes to settle  the more significant the impact of inflation on final settlement costs 
the company periodically reviews outstanding claims and adjusts reserves for the pools based on a number of factors  including inflation
