item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations earnings and dividends earnings per share for were on net income of million  which represents a increase from the per share earned in return on average common equity for was compared to in the increase in earnings was primarily due to successful efforts to contain operating costs 
in addition  the company earned  after taxes  as a result of a favorable net property tax settlement 
partially offsetting this increase was the impact on operations of the significantly warmer weather during the heating season 
while the weather was warmer than the prior year  it was warmer during the november march period 
the company s board of directors increased the quarterly dividend during the fiscal year 
the current quarterly dividend of cents per share is equal to an annual dividend of per share 
cash dividends paid to common shareholders in were more than million  representing a payout ratio of of earnings 
utility sales and revenues the company s rates charged to customers are regulated by the commission 
the commission is required by new hampshire law to allow the company to charge rates that are just and reasonable  such that the company is compensated for the cost of providing service and allowed a reasonable rate of return on its investment 
the company regularly assesses whether it is earning a reasonable return and files for rate increases when it determines that it is not being permitted to earn a reasonable return 
the company generates revenues primarily through the sale and transportation of natural gas 
the company s gas sales are divided into two categories firm  whereby the company must supply gas to customers on demand  and interruptible  whereby the company may  generally during cooler months  discontinue service to high volume commercial and industrial customers 
sales of gas to interruptible customers do not materially affect the company s operating income because all margin on such sales is returned to the company s firm customers 
the company s tariff includes cga rates that provide for increases and decreases in the rates charged for gas to reflect estimated changes in the cost of gas 
although changes in cga rates affect revenues  they do not affect total margin because the cga is a tariff mechanism designed to provide dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs 
amounts recovered through cga rates are reconciled semiannually against actual costs  and future cga rates are adjusted accordingly 
the company s sales are responsive to colder weather because the majority of its firm customers use natural gas for space heating purposes 
the company measures weather through the use of degree days 
a degree day is calculated by subtracting the average temperature for the day from degrees fahrenheit 
the normal number of degree days during any period is calculated based upon a rolling approximate year average number of degree days during such period 
the table below discloses degree day data as recorded at the us weather station in concord  new hampshire  comparing actual degree days to the previous period and to normal 
because of the size and topographical variations of the company s service territory  weather conditions within such territory often vary 
the company considers concord  new hampshire weather data to be representative of weather conditions within its service territory 
degree days prior change vs

actual period normal prior period normal fiscal year ended september     fiscal year ended september     
fiscal year ended september     utility gas service operating revenues were million in  compared to million in the increase resulted primarily from increased cga rates to cover gas costs deferred in the prior year and increases in the cost of gas 
in addition  the growth in the average number of customers in was approximately 
the volume of firm gas sendout was slightly less than the weather in was warmer than in  although the november march winter heating season was warmer 
revenues from gas transported for customers under firm transportation service rates increased more than to million  due to a more than increase in volumes transported 
this increase included a shift of  mcf from firm commercial and industrial sales customers  representing a decrease of  in operating revenue attributable to the commodity cost of gas 
shifts between transportation and sales gas will cause variations in natural gas revenues since the transportation rate does not include the commodity cost of gas  which is billed directly to the customer by its marketer 
prior to august   the company s rate structure provided approximately the same margin for sales service and transportation service 
effective august   transportation rates were reduced by approximately 
the company cannot predict the impact  if any  that the results of this reduction in transportation rates will have on customers decisions to switch to transportation service or the resulting impact decisions to switch would have on operating income 
the company will seek an adjustment in overall rates  if it determines that reductions in transportation rates and increases in the number of transportation customers impair its ability to earn its allowed return 
at september   the company had firm transportation customers compared to customers the previous year 
utility cost of gas sold the cost of gas sold was million in and million in the increase was primarily due to higher prices from suppliers million and timing differences related to the recovery of gas costs through the cga million

retail propane operations retail propane operations contributed  to net earnings of the company  a decrease of  compared to included in the results is the after tax loss of more than  from the first year of operation of the company s propane joint venture in vermont 
while operating revenues increased million to million  gross margin increased only slightly as the unit cost of gas increased more than 
the warmer weather  especially during the november march winter period  offset substantial customer growth of more than and resulted in a decrease in propane gallons sold of approximately 
operations and maintenance expense increased more than as a result of increases in labor  transportation and other delivery related expenses necessary to support an expanding customer base 
operating expenses operations and maintenance expense was about the same as the prior year 
reductions in the work force  other cost saving initiatives and workers compensation insurance refunds helped offset the increases from liability insurance  uncollectible accounts and other administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from million to almost million in  consistent with the company s continued investment in the expansion and upgrading of its distribution system and facilities and amortization of environmental remediation costs 
net additions to property  plant and equipment were million and million in and  respectively 
taxes other than income taxes decreased million to million  primarily due to a favorable property tax settlement  net of adjustments  of more than million  which offset property tax rate increases and additions to taxable property 
capital resources and liquidity because of the seasonal nature of the company s operations  a substantial portion of cash receipts is generated during the november march heating season  which results in the highest cash inflow during late winter and early spring 
however  cash requirements for capital expenditures  dividends  long term debt retirement and working capital do not track this pattern of cash receipts 
the greatest demand for cash is in the fall and early winter to support the completion of the annual construction program and to fund gas inventories and other working capital requirements
