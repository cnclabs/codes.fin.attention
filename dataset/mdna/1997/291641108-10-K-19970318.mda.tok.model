item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations operating revenues and kilowatt hour sales of the company s total electric operating revenues during  approximately were from residential customers  from commercial customers  from industrial customers  from wholesale on system customers and from wholesale off system transactions 
the remainder of such revenues were derived from miscellaneous sources 
the percentage changes from the prior year in kilowatt hour kwh sales and revenue by major customer class were as follows kwh sales revenues residential commercial industrial wholesale on system total system kwh sales to and revenue from the company s on system customers increased during  due primarily to the effect of warm summer temperatures during the second quarter  particularly during the month of june  and significantly colder weather during the first and fourth quarters compared to the same periods in mild weather conditions during the third quarter of partially offset the positive impact of such favorable weather conditions 
customer growth throughout the company s service territory  including continuing increases in business activity  positively impacted kwh sales and related revenue  although such growth in was at a slower rate than in in addition  the effect of an electric rate increase in missouri effective november contributed to the increased revenue during the year 
residential and commercial kwh sales increased more than the corresponding increase in revenues during  primarily due to the effect of changes in the company s rate design in its missouri rate increase 
this restructuring resulted in  among other things  the shifting of revenue from winter billing periods to summer billing periods 
on system wholesale kwh sales and revenues were up during the period reflecting the weather conditions discussed above 
revenues associated with these ferc regulated sales in increased at a greater relative amount than kwh sales due to the operation of the fuel adjustment clause applicable to such sales  which permits the pass through to customers of higher fuel and purchased power costs 
residential and commercial kwh sales and revenue increased during  reflecting significantly warmer summer temperatures experienced during compared to the mild summer weather in and a return to normal winter temperatures during december  after extremely mild weather experienced during december customer growth also contributed to increased residential and commercial sales and revenue during the year 
during  both commercial and industrial kwh sales and related revenues were positively impacted by continuing increases in business activity throughout the company s service territory 
residential  commercial and industrial revenues were also positively affected by the missouri rate case discussed above 
on system wholesale kwh sales were up during due primarily to the weather conditions discussed above 
revenues associated with these kwh sales increased at a lower relative amount due to the operation of the fuel adjustment clause applicable to such ferc regulated sales 
the following table sets forth information regarding electric rate increases affecting the revenue comparisons discussed above percent date increase increase increase date jurisdiction requested requested granted granted effective missouri   missouri   oklahoma   kansas   on august   the company filed a request with the missouri public service commission the missouri commission for an interim increase in rates for its missouri electric customers in the amount of  or  to allow the company to recover higher expenses resulting from natural gas prices and purchased power prices in which were significantly higher than the levels contemplated by the company s existing rates 
on august   the missouri commission notified the company that it had rejected the interim request on the basis that an interim rate request cannot be considered without a pending general rate case 
on august   the company filed a request with the missouri commission for a general increase in rates for its missouri electric customers in the amount of approximately  or 
in addition  the company also re filed its interim case 
on february   the missouri commission issued an order rejecting the company s interim request on the basis that the company did not show good cause or other sufficient justification for the granting of interim rate relief 
hearings for the general rate case are scheduled to begin on april  under missouri law  the missouri commission must act on the company s request by july  the company cannot predict the extent of any increase which might be granted as a result of this filing 
the company s future revenues from the sale of electricity will continue to be affected by economic conditions  business activities  competition  weather  regulation  changes in electric rate levels and changing patterns of electric energy use by customers 
inflation affects the company s operations in that historical costs rather than current replacement costs are recovered in the company s rates 
off system transactions in addition to sales to its own customers  the company also sells power to other utilities as available and also provides transmission service through its system for transactions between other energy suppliers 
during  income from such off system transactions exceeded related expenses by approximately million  compared with approximately million during the increase in income from off system transactions during was due primarily to an increase in revenue from transmission service transactions through the western systems power pool  of which the company is a member 
operating revenue deductions during  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
excluding the one time pre tax charge of approximately million in the third quarter of relating to the company s voluntary early retirement program the verp  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to levels 
total purchased power costs increased approximately million during  due primarily to increased purchases of replacement energy during an extended five year turbine inspection at the asbury plant 
the inspection  which was scheduled to last approximately six weeks  began on march and was extended until june several forced outages at the company s low cost asbury and jointly owned iatan plants during the third quarter of also resulted in the company purchasing greater amounts of replacement energy than it purchased during in addition  the company increased its level of purchases to meet higher customer demand during the first half and fourth quarter of  particularly during periods of extremely cold weather during january and february of  when the company s suppliers curtailed the delivery of natural gas to the company and other utilities in the region 
the weather also resulted in the decreased availability of low cost energy from hydro and nuclear units of other utilities 
these factors contributed to higher demand and a tight market for purchased energy and resulted in significantly higher prices for such energy during the first half of when compared to the same periods in total fuel costs were up approximately million during  due primarily to the increased generation from higher cost  gas fired combustion turbine units at the energy center in response to high customer demand and the reduced availability of the asbury plant as discussed above 
natural gas prices were considerably higher during compared to fuel costs were also impacted early in the year by the use of higher cost fuel oil at the energy center and riverton plant during periods of extremely cold weather when natural gas supplies were curtailed 
other operating expenses decreased approximately million during compared to levels excluding expenses related to the verp  due primarily to lower general and administrative costs 
during  the company s general and administrative costs were higher in large part because of the legal proceeding relating to the proposed purchase of energy from ahlstrom development corporation ahlstrom which concluded in november  and the company s competitive positioning process cpp discussed in the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  maintenance and repair expense increased approximately million during compared to levels  due primarily to increased maintenance performed on the company s distribution system 
a significant portion of such increase was due to approximately million in repairs associated with damage from a wind storm which occurred at the end of april  and approximately million in repairs associated with damage from an ice storm which occurred in the company s service territory at the end of november these additional expenses were offset in part by a reduction in maintenance expense at the company s riverton plant 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million during the year due to increased levels of plant and equipment placed in service  particularly at the company s state line power plant 
total income taxes increased during due primarily to higher taxable income during the current period 
see note of notes to financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 
other taxes were up approximately million during the year  primarily reflecting increased franchise taxes relating to higher revenues and increased property taxes due to higher levels of plant in service 
during  total operating expenses exclusive of the verp were higher compared to levels primarily due to higher general and administrative costs associated with the ahlstrom proceedings  cpp costs other than the verp and increased fuel and purchased power costs 
fuel costs were up during compared to the prior year primarily because the company substantially increased its generation from its higher cost  gas fired combustion turbine units following completion of the conversion of the company s energy center to utilize natural gas as a primary fuel  as well as the commercial availability of state line unit no 
partially offsetting such increases were more favorable prices experienced by the company during for both natural gas and iatan coal 
maintenance expenses were up due primarily to increased maintenance performed on the company s riverton and asbury generating units as well as increased maintenance on the company s distribution system resulting in part from the system s growth 
depreciation and amortization expense increased due to the additional plant and equipment placed in service  particularly at state line unit no 
total income taxes decreased slightly due primarily to lower taxable income  while other taxes were up reflecting increased property tax rates  higher levels of plant in service and increased franchise taxes relating to higher revenues 
nonoperating items total allowance for funds used during construction afudc amounted to approximately of earnings applicable to common stock during  during and during afudc decreased significantly during  reflecting completion of state line unit no 
in may the significantly increased level of afudc during reflected a higher level of construction work in progress  particularly due to construction of the state line unit no 
 as well as higher rates for afudc determined in accordance with formulas prescribed by the ferc 
see note of notes to financial statements for more discussion of afudc 
interest income decreased during compared to prior year levels reflecting lower balances of cash available for investment particularly due to increased levels of construction 
interest charges on first mortgage bonds increased compared to the prior year due to additional issuances of the company s first mortgage bonds 
commercial paper interest increased during the year due to increased usage of short term debt to finance the company s construction program 
competition federal regulation  such as the national energy policy act of the energy act has promoted and is expected to continue to promote competition in the electric utility industry 
the energy act  among other things  eases restrictions on independent power producers  delegates authority to the ferc to order wholesale wheeling and grants individual states the power to order retail wheeling 
at this time  none of the states in which the company operates has taken any such action 
in april  the ferc issued order no 
the order which requires all electric utilities that own  operate  or control interstate transmission facilities to file open access tariffs that offer all wholesale buyers and sellers of electricity the same transmission services that they provide themselves 
the utility would have to take service under those tariffs for its own wholesale power transactions 
the order requires a functional unbundling of transmission and power marketing services 
the order also provides stranded cost recovery mechanisms for utilities to recover costs that were incurred to serve wholesale customers that would no longer be recoverable as a result of the customer departing the system and obtaining electric service from another supplier 
in accordance with the order  on july   the company filed its open access transmission tariff with the ferc 
following an extensive audit and discussions  the company  ferc and intervenors reached a proposed settlement which has not yet been approved by such parties 
pursuant to the order and the terms of the proposed settlement  the tariff will not be applicable to substantially all of the company s existing wholesale customers until such customers contracts have expired  or in the case of certain intervening customers  june as a result  the company cannot currently predict the effect of the tariff on its current operations 
in conjunction with order no 
 the ferc issued a companion order  order no 
 which defines the type and timing of information to be made available by utilities to wholesale customers and establishes standards of conduct to ensure that a utility s transmission system operations function independently of the utility s segment which engages in wholesale purchases and sales of electricity 
in december  the company filed with ferc a request for waiver of these standards of conduct 
the company believes it meets the apparent criteria utilized in recent waivers issued by the ferc 
however  the company has procedures in place which it intends to adopt in the event that its pending waiver request is denied  which procedures would increase administrative costs 
several factors exist which may enhance the company s ability to compete as deregulation occurs 
the company is able to generate and purchase power relatively cheaply  during  the company s retail rates were approximately less than the electric industry average 
in addition  only of the company s electric operating revenues are derived from sales to on system wholesale customers  the type of customer for which ferc is already requiring wheeling 
at the same time  the company could face increased competitive pressure as a result of its reliance on relatively large amounts of purchased power and its extensive interconnections with neighboring utilities 
in response to the changing competitive environment that it now faces  the company in initiated and completed the cpp  to maximize efficiency and effectiveness in providing service 
as part of the cpp  the company redesigned its organizational structure 
further  the company has reduced planned construction expenditures and entered into an agreement with western resources for purchased power to reduce the uncertainty of owning new plants 
in addition in  the company also implemented an enhanced voluntary early retirement program which was accepted by of eligible employees and resulted in a pre tax charge of approximately million 
earnings earnings per share of common stock were during compared to in including the one time charge related to the verp  which reduced earnings by approximately per share 
increased revenue resulting from weather conditions favorable to kwh sales  continued customer growth  and the missouri rate increase was partially offset by the increase in expenses discussed above  particularly increases in purchased power expenses  fuel costs and distribution maintenance expenses  as well as decreased levels of afudc 
earnings per share in also reflect a greater number of shares outstanding because of the company s issuance of  shares of common stock in april the company believes that adequate rate relief as a result of its missouri rate case fully described above will be necessary to offset increased fuel  purchased power and other expenses  and to improve earnings 
earnings per share of common stock were during compared to in increased revenue resulting from weather conditions conducive to increased kwh sales  continued customer growth and the rate increases received in missouri  kansas and oklahoma were more than offset by increased operating expenses and the one time charge related to the verp which reduced earnings by approximately per share 
earnings per share also reflect increased first mortgage bond interest  resulting from greater levels of first mortgage bonds outstanding  increased preferred stock dividend requirements resulting from the company s issuance of preferred stock in a public offering in june and the company s issuance of  shares of common stock in april liquidity and capital resources the company s construction related expenditures totaled approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
approximately million of construction expenditures during were related to the construction of unit no 
at the state line power plant  which is currently scheduled to be placed in service by may  additions to the company s transmission and distribution systems to accommodate additional customer demand represented approximately million of construction expenditures during approximately million of the above mentioned construction expenditures for is related to the company s investment in fiber optics cable and equipment which the company plans to utilize and to lease to other entities 
approximately three fourths of construction expenditures and other funds requirements for were satisfied internally from operations  the remainder was provided from the sale to the public of the company s common stock and first mortgage bonds discussed below  the issuance of commercial paper and from the sale of common stock through the company s dividend reinvestment plan and employee stock purchase plan 
the company estimates that its construction expenditures will total approximately million in  million in and million in of these amounts  the company anticipates that it will spend million  million and million in  and  respectively  for additions to the company s distribution system to meet projected increases in customer demand 
also included are expenditures of million anticipated in for the completion of unit no 
at the state line power plant 
on august   the company amended its existing agreement with westinghouse to increase the aggregate megawatt capability of unit no 
at the state line power plant from megawatts to megawatts 
the resulting increase of approximately million to construction expenditures is reflected in the above construction expenditures 
the company estimates that internally generated funds will provide at least of the funds required between and for estimated construction expenditures 
as in the past  the company intends to utilize short term debt to finance the additional amounts needed for such construction and repay such borrowings with the proceeds of sales of public offerings of long term debt or equity securities  including the sale of the company s common stock pursuant to its dividend reinvestment plan and employee stock purchase plan and from internally generated funds 
the company will continue to utilize short term debt as needed to support normal operations or other temporary requirements 
see note of notes to financial statements regarding the company s line of credit 
on april   the company sold to the public in an underwritten offering  shares of its common stock 
the net proceeds of the offering of approximately million were added to the company s general funds which were used to repay short term indebtedness and for expenses incurred in connection with the company s construction program 
on december   the company sold to the public in an underwritten offering million aggregate principal amount of its first mortgage bonds  series due  the proceeds of which were added to the company s general funds which were used to repay short term indebtedness and for expenses incurred in connection with its construction program
