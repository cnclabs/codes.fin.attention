in those cases the corporation endeavors to pass on increases where agreements and market conditions permit 
operating profit for the segment decreased by million for the year from million for to million for the decrease primarily resulted from the operational problem created by the previously discussed raw material contamination as well as the customer resistance encountered in attempting to recover higher material and operational costs through product price increases
