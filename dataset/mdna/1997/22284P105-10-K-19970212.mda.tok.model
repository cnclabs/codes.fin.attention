liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business has required significant investments in new revenue equipment 
the company historically has financed its revenue equipment requirements with borrowings under installment notes payable to commercial lending institutions and equipment manufacturers  borrowings under a line of credit  cash flows from operations and long term operating leases 
the company s primary sources of liquidity at december   were funds provided by operations  borrowings under its million credit agreement  funds provided from its million in senior notes due october  and an operating lease covering its new headquarters and terminal facility 
the company s primary source of cash flow from operations is net income increased by depreciation and deferred income taxes 
historically  financing increases in receivables and advances associated with the company s revenue growth has been a significant use of cash provided by operations  and management anticipates that it will be a significant use in the future 
in  a decrease in receivables and advances was attributable to collection of a million other receivable and rectifying an accounts receivable imbalance caused by delays in billing for shipments in while the company converted to new billing software 
these factors depressed cash provided by operating activities in and inflated it in the company s number of days outstanding in accounts receivable increased from days in  to days in  and then decreased to days in net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in the primary sources of funds from operations in were net income of million and non cash adjustments including depreciation of million  deferred income taxes of million  accounts receivable of million  and accounts payable of million 
the primary operating use of funds by operating activities was to fund an increase in prepaid expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in  and million in such amounts were used primarily to acquire additional revenue equipment as the company expanded its operations 
the company expects capital expenditures primarily for revenue equipment  net of trade ins  to be approximately million in net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in  and million in in  the initial public offering provided million in net proceeds 
approximately million was used to pay down debt and the remainder was used to purchase property and equipment 
the cash provided by financing activities in and related primarily to borrowings under the company s million credit agreement and million in senior notes due october at december   the company had outstanding debt of million 
interest rates on this debt ranged from to 
at december   approximately million was drawn under the company s million credit agreement 
the credit agreement is with a syndicate of banks and provides for outstanding borrowing to bear interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin of between and 
at december   the applicable margin was 
during february and may  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed interest rates on million and million of the borrowings under the credit agreement at and  respectively  plus the applicable margin for two years 
an additional million interest rate swap agreement was completed in to fix interest rates on million from february until february at plus the applicable margin 
all remaining borrowings under the credit agreement are at one  two  or three month libor plus the applicable margin 
may contain forward looking statements 
the company also had outstanding million in senior notes due october that were placed with an insurance company 
the notes bear interest at  payable semi annually 
principal payments are due in equal annual installments beginning in october proceeds of the senior notes were used to reduce borrowings under the million credit agreement 
the company took possession of its new headquarters and terminal facility in december the facility was constructed under a build to suit operating lease and is expected to increase the company s annual facilities costs by approximately  the million credit agreement  senior notes  and headquarters and terminal lease agreement contain certain restrictions and covenants relating to  among other things  dividends  tangible net worth  cash flow  acquisitions and dispositions  and total indebtedness 
all of these instruments are cross defaulted 
the company was in compliance with the agreements at december inflation and fuel costs with the exception of occasional fuel price increases  inflation has had a minimal effect upon the company s profitability in recent years 
in  a sharp increase in fuel prices occurred nationwide as a result of a perceived shortage in supply 
the company historically has been able to pass through most increases in fuel prices and taxes to customers in the form of higher rates 
as of december   the company had entered into fuel surcharge agreements or obtained rate increases from the majority of its customers 
the fuel surcharges are adjusted weekly based on the national weekly average price of diesel fuel published by the department of energy 
management expects to maintain the fuel surcharges and seek additional rate increases 
most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
increases in fuel prices that are not fully recovered through fuel surcharges or rate increases may affect covenant more than some other carriers 
fuel expense comprises a larger percentage of revenue for covenant than many other carriers because of covenant s long average length of haul 
accordingly  the company expects that inflation will affect its costs other than fuel no more than it affects those of other truckload carriers 
seasonality in the trucking industry  revenue generally decreases as customers reduce shipments during the winter holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather related equipment repair increases 
as a result of lower company net income in january and february  first quarter net income historically has been lower than net income in each of the other three quarters of the year 
the company s equipment utilization typically improves substantially between may and october of each year because of the industry s seasonal shortage of equipment on traffic originating in california 
the seasonal shortage has occurred between may and august because california produce carriers equipment is diverted to refrigerated traffic during those months and during september and october as a result of an increased amount of retail merchandise shipped in anticipation of the holidays 
the table below sets forth quarterly information reflecting the company s equipment utilization miles per tractor per period during   and the company believes that equipment utilization more accurately demonstrates the seasonality of its business than changes in revenue  which are affected by the timing of deliveries of new revenue equipment 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends

written forward looking statements may appear in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in reports to stockholders 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
the company relies on this safe harbor in making such disclosures 
in connection with this safe harbor provision  the company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following economic factors  fuel prices 
negative economic factors such as recessions  downturns in customers business cycles  surplus inventories  inflation  and higher interest rates could impair the company s operating results by decreasing equipment utilization or increasing costs of operations 
resale of used revenue equipment 
the company historically has recognized a gain on the sale of its revenue equipment 
the market for used equipment has experienced greater supply than demand in and if the resale value of the company s revenue equipment were to decline  the company could find it necessary to dispose of its equipment at lower prices or retain some of its equipment longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers 
competition for drivers is intense in the trucking industry 
there is  and historically has been  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers 
this shortage could force the company to significantly increase the compensation it pays to driver employees or curtail the company s growth 
competition 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with other truckload carriers  private fleets operated by existing and potential customers  railroads  railintermodal service  and to some extent with air freight service 
competition is based primarily on service  efficiency  and freight rates 
many competitors offer transportation service at lower rates than the company 
the company s results could suffer if it cannot obtain higher rates than competitors that offer a lower level of service
