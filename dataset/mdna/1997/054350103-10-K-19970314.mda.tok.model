item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with avondale industries  inc s the company or avondale consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview the improvement in the company s operating results continued during fiscal with the company reporting record financial results for net sales were above the prior year s level  income from continuing operations before income taxes increased and net income increased by compared to fiscal the company s firm backlog at december  was approximately billion including estimated contract escalation exclusive of unexercised options aggregating billion held by the us navy the navy for additional ship orders including estimated contract escalation 
firm backlog includes two navy contracts awarded in  the first of which was the exercise of a previously awarded option to construct an additional sealift ship for approximately million or more than million after considering certain additional components and reimbursable escalation 
the exercise of this option represents the fifth ship which the company has been awarded in the sealift program 
the navy holds an option for an additional sealift ship which is exercisable in in december  the us navy awarded a contract to build the first ship of its new class of lpd vessels to an alliance led by the company 
in addition  the alliance was awarded options  exercisable by the us navy  for two additional ships of the lpd class 
it is expected that a total of vessels will be built under the lpd program 
the members of the alliance  bath  hughes and the company submitted a joint bid with the company as the prime contractor 
under the terms of an agreement between the alliance members  the company will build the vessel covered by the december contract  and if the us navy exercises the two options  the company would also construct the second and bath would construct the third of the three lpd vessels 
hughes will be responsible for total ship integration and the alliance will use intergraph technology for the design and manufacture of the ship 
in order to fairly represent its role as the prime contractor under the lpd contract  the company is required to report in its financial statements the entire contract amount for each vessel in the lpd program constructed by the alliance as revenue 
under the subcontracting agreements entered into between the company and each of bath and hughes  the award fees that can be earned under the lpd contract are distributable among the alliance members in proportion to each member s performance and participation in the construction of the vessel for which the award was granted 
to the extent that the company s revenues include costs incurred by and award fees paid to the other alliance members  the company s profit margins will be reduced 
for additional information on the terms of the lpd contract award  the relationship between the members of the alliance and certain accounting considerations  see business overview 
vessel deliveries in fiscal included the third of three lsd cvs and a double hulled t ao representing the th vessel built by the company since the program s inception in these deliveries represent the completion of construction on two multi ship programs which provided a significant portion of the company s workload over the past several years 
additionally  the company delivered the third of four mhc vessels in  and in january  the company delivered the fourth and final vessel under the contract 
the company s operating results projected for are expected to be related principally to the lsd cv  the sealift ship contracts and the icebreaker  while results projected for are expected to reflect primarily the sealift and icebreaker contracts 
except for the lpd contract  the company records profits under the percentage of completion method of accounting based on direct labor charges 
see business overview 
although the company generally does not begin to record profits on its contracts until contract performance is sufficient to estimate final results with reasonable accuracy  actual profits taken with respect to such contracts may be affected if the company is required in the future to revise its estimate of the cost to complete one or more of such contracts 
as previously disclosed  certain of the company s operations closed in with the completion of their respective contracts 
one of these facilities was sold in december  and the other is currently offered for sale 
with respect to the remaining property  the company currently is not aware of any material environmental liabilities to be incurred for site restoration  post closure monitoring commitments or other exit costs 
results of operations vs 
the company recorded net income of million  or per share  for compared to million  or per share  for representing an increase of in net income over the prior year 
net income for and include income tax benefits of million  or per share  and million  or per share  respectively  as discussed below 
also included in and net income are million  or per share  and million  or per share  respectively  reductions of a previously recognized loss which was recorded in prior years on the contract to construct three lsd cvs 
the reductions were due primarily to revisions of the total estimated contract cost as it neared completion 
in addition to the improvements on the three lsd cv contract  the increases in the company s operating results in reflect improved operating profits recognized on the seven t ao contract  which was completed in  and the lsd cv contract 
in addition  the company began profit recognition on the contract to construct five strategic sealift vessels for the navy 
also contributing to the increase in operating results for were operating profits of million recorded by the company s marine repair  modular construction and wholesale steel operations 
these profits were offset  in part  by losses recorded on two commercial marine construction contracts 
the company recognized an million loss on the contract to construct river hopper barges  primarily representing costs incurred in connection with the company s entry into this competitive market 
in addition  the company recorded a million loss with respect to the contract to retrofit four single hull commercial tankers with new double hulls 
this loss resulted from several factors  the most important of which related to certain modifications to the hull design that were required in order to comply with american bureau of shipbuilding standards after construction had been commenced by the company in order to respond to a significantly compressed construction schedule caused by the customer s delay in obtaining financing 
in addition  this project was commenced prior to the time that the company s new automated production facility had become fully operational  and therefore did not benefit from the efficiencies which would have been realized from the completed factory 
finally  the pre delivery testing of the first vessel revealed a condition which required certain modifications causing the company to incur incremental costs 
the impact of these losses was mitigated by the fact that these contracts absorbed a substantial amount of operating expenses that would otherwise have been allocated to other contracts 
in addition  these contracts have been important in the company s reemergence in the competitive commercial tanker and barge markets 
the tanker contract has also enabled the company to construct four forebodies which are patterned after the forebody of avondale s standard tanker  providing experience in constructing this portion of the vessel  enabling the company to refine the design and production techniques  and furthering the company s progress toward achieving its stated goal of a more balanced mix of military and commercial work 
the first double hull tanker was delivered on october  while the second hull was delivered january  the remaining vessels are scheduled to be delivered in may and september the company s net sales in increased million  or  as compared to the prior year 
the increase in net sales was due primarily to increases in sales revenues recognized on the contracts to construct the first five sealift ships  the icebreaker and the forebodies for four double hulled product tankers  which collectively accounted for of the company s net sales revenue 
the increase in net sales was partially offset by reductions in sales revenues recognized on the contracts to construct the three lsd cvs the last of which was delivered in march  lsd cv scheduled for completion in november  the seven t aos the last of which was delivered in may and four mhcs the third of which was delivered in july and the last of which was delivered in january 
the increase in net sales was also partially offset by reduced net sales recorded on paddle wheeled gaming vessels the last of which was delivered in 
the contracts to construct the three lsd cvs  the lsd cv  the seven t aos and four mhcs collectively accounted for of the company s net sales revenue 
gross profit for increased million  or  compared to the increase in gross profit was due primarily to profits recognized on the contract to construct the lsd cv and the seven t aos 
also contributing to the increase in gross profit was the start of profit recognition on the contract to construct the strategic sealift vessels 
the increase in gross profit was partially offset by the losses recorded on the barge and forebodies contracts discussed above 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million  or  for compared to the overall increase in sg a expenses was due primarily to increased labor costs  professional fees and computer equipment rental costs associated with the company s successful lpd proposal

as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  these amounts were principally the result of recognizing  for financial reporting purposes  income tax benefits from certain net operating loss carry forwards available to offset estimated future taxable earnings 
in and  the million and million respective tax benefits were offset by income tax provisions of million and million related to and operating results  respectively

the reduction was due primarily to a revision of the total estimated contract cost as it nears completion 
included in net income for are a million  or per share  net gain related to revisions of estimated contract profits on several previously completed shipbuilding contracts and a loss from discontinued operations of million  or per share  reflecting the company s decision in to discontinue its service contracting business 
the significant increases in the company s operating results in primarily reflect increased operating profits recognized on the lsd cv contract  as well as the reversal of part of a previously recognized loss on the contract to construct three lsd cvs  and the recognition of operating profit on the t ao contract 
also contributing to the increase in operating results for were profits recorded by the company s marine repair and wholesale steel operations and an increase in interest income primarily resulting from an increase in the company s invested cash balances 
the company s net sales in increased million  or  as compared to the prior year 
the increase in net sales was due primarily to increases in sales revenues recognized on the contracts to construct the first three sealift ships  the forebodies for four double hulled product tankers  the lsd cv and the icebreaker  which collectively accounted for of the company s net sales revenue 
the increase in net sales was partially offset by reductions in sales revenues recognized on the contracts to construct the seven t aos the fifth and sixth of which were delivered in  three lsd cvs the second of which was delivered in and four mhcs the first of which was delivered in  as these contracts approach completion 
the contracts to construct the t aos  three lsd cvs  and four mhcs collectively accounted for of the company s net sales revenue

these increases in sg a expenses were partially offset by a decrease in sg a expenses resulting from the closing of certain subsidiary operations 
interest expense increased by  or  in as compared to the increase was due principally to interest expense associated with the million title xi financing completed in february as discussed below  million of series industrial revenue bonds see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and a note issued as part of a litigation settlement discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in interest capitalized on assets under construction relating primarily to the modernization project 
the company s operating results include a net income tax benefit of million  or per share 
as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the net income tax benefit is principally the result of recognizing  for financial reporting purposes  a million income tax benefit from certain net operating loss carry forwards available to offset estimated future taxable earnings 
the million tax benefit was partially offset by an income tax provision of million related to operating results 
there was a minor provision for income taxes in the same period in as an income tax benefit related to available net operating loss carry forwards was recognized only to the extent of then current operating results 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december  as compared to million at december  contributing to the improved cash balance at december  were amounts collected as a result of the settlement of the company s request for equitable adjustment minehunter rea filed with the us navy related to the four mhcs currently under contract as discussed in further detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s operating activities represented a significant source of cash in  generating approximately million 
the company s primary uses of cash in the current year consisted of capital expenditures of million and principal payments on long term borrowings of million 
the company s million revolving credit agreement the agreement provides available liquidity for working capital purposes  capital expenditures and letters of credit 
at december   there were approximately million of letters of credit issued against the agreement leaving approximately million of liquidity available to avondale for operations and other purposes 
continuing access to the agreement is conditioned upon the company remaining in compliance with the covenants which include certain financial ratios 
at december  the company was in compliance with the covenants contained therein 
the company believes that its capital resources will be sufficient to finance current and projected operations 
in order to comply with the terms of the lpd contract  the company will make significant capital expenditures  particularly to enhance its computer aided design and product modeling capabilities 
the company currently has sufficient cash and available lines of credit to fund these capital expenditures 
nevertheless  the company and its banks agreed to increase the size of its revolving credit agreement from million to million conditioned upon the favorable resolution of the protest of the lpd contract which resolution is anticipated in early april 
the increase in the size of the agreement is sufficient to allow the company to fund the expenditures on an interim basis with borrowings under the agreement while preserving the current level of available liquidity 
the amended agreement provides that the available credit under the agreement will be reduced to approximately million once a long term financing for the lpd expenditures is in place as discussed below and  at the same time  the banks have agreed to eliminate all collateral except their second mortgage on the company s foot floating drydock 
in addition  the amended agreement would extend the expiration date until april under planned long term financing for the lpd expenditures  the company  in conjunction with the university of new orleans the university  and the university of new orleans research and technology foundation the foundation  intends to construct a  square foot building on property owned by the company adjacent to the company s main shipyard 
in addition  the plan includes the purchase of the hardware and software required to comply with the lpd contract terms related to the implementation of the extensive three dimensional ship design and ipde teaming technology 
the initial investment in this new facility  which will be known as the uno avondale maritime technology center of excellence  is estimated at million  and will be financed by the foundation using third party debt or lease financing to be repaid through annual appropriations from the state and guaranteed by the company 
the company will enter into a long term lease for the center requiring only a nominal lease payment 
the company will guarantee the debt and provide access to the technology and a portion of the center to the university for their use in research and the development of educational curricula 
the company and the university are in the process of securing the required approvals 
development of the center and the requisite state support are contingent on the successful resolution of the lpd protest 
the company s estimated net operating loss carry forward for income tax purposes was million at december  this amount  plus available income tax credits from prior years of million  and million of alternative minimum tax credits will be used to reduce the income tax liabilities for and later years 
the million cash paid in for income taxes reflects payments for alternative minimum tax 
the net operating loss carry forwards expire in years through and the tax credit carry forwards expire in years through the alternative minimum tax credits may be carried forward indefinitely 
the company expects that a change of control of the company for tax purposes is likely to occur in which may limit the timing of the company s use of its net operating loss carry forwards in and later years
