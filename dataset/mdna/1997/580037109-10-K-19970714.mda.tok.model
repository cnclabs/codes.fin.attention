item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general a significant portion of international s revenues and operating results are derived from its foreign operations 
as a result  international s operations and financial results are affected by international factors  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
international attempts to minimize its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates by attempting to match foreign currency contract receipts with like foreign currency disbursements 
to the extent that it is unable to match the foreign currency receipts and disbursements related to its contracts  its practice of entering into forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions reduces the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on operating results 
in general  both of international s business segments are capital intensive businesses that rely on large contracts for a substantial amount of their revenues 
revenues of the power generation systems and equipment segment are largely a function of capital spending by the electric power generation industry and by the us government 
this segment has recently experienced weak and difficult markets in nearly all of its product lines 
domestic utility original equipment markets remain sluggish as growth in demand remains modest and the electric power industry transitions from a regulated to a competitive environment 
however  demand for services to the domestic utility industry and for nuclear fuel assemblies and reactor components for the us navy continue at significant levels 
in addition  foreign markets for industrial and utility boilers remain strong in asia and the middle east 
revenues of the marine construction services segment are largely a function of the level of oil and gas development activity in the world s major hydrocarbon producing regions 
consequently  revenues reflect the variability associated with the timing of significant development projects 
this segment s operating results have been adversely affected by a substantial decline in significant development projects in southeast asia  and low margins in all of its other major markets 
international expects improvements in its markets  especially in southeast asia and the gulf of mexico 
consolidated backlog has increased significantly and there have been some pricing improvements 
the foregoing statements regarding international s markets and other statements in this discussion are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
these include uncertainties relating to deregulation and the clean air act  as well as offshore development decisions to be made by oil and gas exploration and development companies 
fiscal year vs fiscal year power generation systems and equipment s revenues decreased  to  primarily due to lower revenues from the fabrication and erection of fossil fuel steam and environmental control systems  replacement nuclear steam generators  construction of cogeneration plants  nuclear services and replacement parts 
these decreases were partially offset by higher revenues from commercial nuclear environmental services 
power generation systems and equipment s segment operating income loss decreased  from income of  to a loss of  a provision for estimated future non employee products asbestos claims  the write down of an equity investment in a domestic cogeneration joint venture and an asset impairment loss on a domestic manufacturing facility  net of gains on asset disposals  resulted in an increase in segment loss of  in the current year 
there were also lower volume and margins on the fabrication and erection of fossil fuel steam and environmental control systems and on replacement parts 
there were also lower volume on replacement nuclear steam generators  lower margins on plant enhancement projects  cost overruns on a contract for a canadian cogeneration plant and increased severance and relocation costs 
these decreases were partially offset by higher volume and margins on commercial nuclear environmental services and lower workers compensation expense 
power generation systems and equipment s equity in income of investees  which represents the results of approximately active joint ventures  decreased  to  the income in fiscal year was primarily due to the gain on the sale of power purchase contracts back to a local utility 
there were also lower operating results in three of the joint ventures in the current year 
backlog for this segment at march  and was  and  respectively 
at march   this segment s backlog with the us government was  of which  had not been funded and includes orders for nuclear fuel assemblies and reactor components for the us navy 
these orders are expected to continue to comprise a substantial portion of backlog with the us government as b w is the sole source provider of these nuclear fuel assemblies and reactor components 
marine construction services revenues increased  to  primarily due to higher volume in north america  the middle east and the far east 
in addition  there was higher volume from barge construction activities in domestic shipyard operations and increased ship repair activities in mexican operations 
these were partially offset by lower volume in the north sea and in engineering and construction activities 
there was also lower leasing revenues due to the sale of the db and db to the heeremac joint venture 
marine construction services segment operating income loss decreased  from income of  to a loss of  net gains on asset disposals  after deduction for certain writedowns of asset valuations  were  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year excluding these net gains  operating income decreased  the decrease was primarily due to lower volume in the north sea  lower leasing activities due to the sale of the db and db  lower margins in the far east  and the completion of profitable contracts in west africa in the prior year as well as cost overruns on domestic barge operations in the current year 
these were partially offset by higher volume in north america and the middle east 
marine construction services equity in income loss of investees decreased  from income of  to a loss of  this decrease was primarily due to the lower results from the mcdermott etpm west  inc joint venture 
revenues of the mcdermott etpm west  inc joint venture increased  to  in fiscal year primarily due to increased volume in the north sea and west africa 
equity in income of this joint venture decreased  to a loss of  in fiscal year primarily due to lower margins in west africa 
in addition  there were favorable results from a mexican joint venture 
backlog for this segment at march  and was  and  respectively 
not included in backlog at march  and was backlog relating to contracts to be performed by unconsolidated joint ventures of approximately  and  respectively 
interest income increased  to  primarily due to interest on the promissory note received as part of the consideration from the sale of the db and db interest expense increased  to  primarily due to changes in debt obligations and interest rates prevailing thereon 
minority interest expense decreased  to  primarily due to minority shareholder participation in the operating results of jrm 
other net expense increased  to  primarily due to a loss of  in the current year for insolvent insurers providing coverage for estimated future non employee asbestos claims  partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains in the current year compared to foreign currency transaction losses in the prior year 
the provision for income taxes decreased  from a provision of  to a benefit of  while income before income taxes decreased  from income of  to a loss of  the decrease in income taxes is primarily due to a decrease in income offset  in part  due to a limitation on the recognition of income tax benefits in the u 
s 
in addition  international operates in many different tax jurisdictions 
within these jurisdictions  tax provisions vary because of nominal rates  allowability of deductions  credits and other benefits  and even tax basis for example  revenues versus income 
these variances  along with variances in the mix of income within jurisdictions  are responsible for shifts in the effective tax rate 
as a result of these factors  the benefit from income taxes was of pre tax loss in fiscal year compared to a provision for income taxes of of pre tax income in fiscal year fiscal year vs fiscal year power generation systems and equipment s revenues increased  to  this was primarily due to higher revenues from engineering  procurement and construction of cogeneration plants  from defense and space related products other than nuclear fuel assemblies and reactor components  replacement nuclear steam generators for domestic customers manufactured at b w s cambridge  ontario location and fabrication of industrial boilers 
these increases were partially offset by lower revenues from repair and alteration of existing fossil fuel steam systems  fabrication and erection of fossil fuel steam and environmental control systems and nuclear fuel assemblies and reactor components for the u 
s 
government 
power generation systems and equipment s segment operating income increased  to  due to provisions of  for the decontamination  decommissioning and closing of certain nuclear manufacturing facilities and the closing of a manufacturing facility in the prior year 
in addition  there were higher volume and margins from replacement nuclear steam generators  improved margins from fabrication of fossil fuel steam and environmental control systems including a license buyout agreement of  and higher volume from defense and space related products other than nuclear fuel assemblies and reactor components 
there was also a gain on the sale of a manufacturing facility 
these increases were offset by the write off of an insurance claim of  due to an unfavorable arbitration ruling related to the recovery of cost incurred for corrective action in certain utility and industrial installations 
there were also lower margins from engineering  procurement and construction of cogeneration plants 
in addition  there were lower volume and margins from the repair and alteration of existing fossil fuel steam systems and industrial boilers  plant enhancement projects and from operations and maintenance contracts 
power generation systems and equipment s equity in income of investees increased  to  this represents the results of approximately active joint ventures  but is primarily due to a nonrecurring equity income gain of  resulting from the sale of power purchase contracts back to a local utility 
marine construction services revenues increased  to  primarily due to higher purchased engineered equipment and subcontract activities in the north sea related to the bp exploration foinaven development program west of the shetlands in the north atlantic and revenues resulting from the acquisition of opi 
there were also higher revenues on marine and engineering activities in north america 
these increases were partially offset by lower revenues in the far east and domestic shipyard operations 
marine construction services segment operating income increased  to  excluding the gain of  from the sale of an interest in caspian sea oil fields  segment operating income decreased  due to higher amortization expense relating to goodwill and other intangibles resulting from the acquisition of opi on january  there were lower margins due to the completion of higher profit margin contracts in the far east and the middle east during fiscal  lower volume in the far east this year  and lower operating income in north america on offshore activities because of weather downtime and lower margins on certain contracts 
this decrease was partially offset by a favorable insurance adjustment of  a net gain on asset disposals  higher volume and margins in north america on fabrication activities  and higher margins on shipyard operations 
during fiscal year  there were also operating losses associated with the fabrication yard in scotland and accelerated depreciation of  on certain marine equipment in the far east 
marine construction services equity in income of investees decreased  to  this decrease was primarily due to lower results from both the heeremac and mcdermott etpm west  inc joint ventures 
the revenues of these two joint ventures declined from  to  primarily in the gulf of mexico  the far east and the north sea  partially offset by increased volume in west africa 
the equity income from these two joint ventures declined from  to  as a result of reduced volume and margins in the north sea 
together these two investees accounted for of equity in earnings of investees 
the decrease was partially offset by higher operating activity from the brown and root mcdermott fabricators limited joint venture which was formed in the last quarter of the prior year 
interest income decreased  to  primarily due to decreases in investments in government obligations and other investments in the current year and income recognized in the prior year on a receivable from an equity investee and settlement of claims for interest relating to foreign tax refunds and contract claims 
interest expense increased  to  primarily due to a reduction in accrued interest of  on proposed tax deficiencies that was recorded in the prior year 
minority interest expense decreased  to  primarily due to minority shareholder participation in the increased losses of the mcdermott etpm east joint venture 
other net expense decreased  to  this decrease was primarily due to a loss related to the reduction of estimated products liability asbestos claim recoveries of  from insurers and a provision for the settlement of a lawsuit  both in the prior year 
the provision for income taxes increased  from a benefit of  to a provision of  while income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change increased  from a loss of  to income of  the increase in income taxes is primarily due to an increase in income partially offset by a reappraisal of  of liabilities in certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
effect of inflation and changing prices international s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  using historical dollar accounting historical cost 
statements based on historical cost  however  do not adequately reflect the cumulative effect of increasing costs and changes in the purchasing power of the dollar  especially during times of significant and continued inflation 
the management of international is cognizant of the effects of inflation and  in order to minimize the negative impact of inflation on its operations  attempts to cover the increased cost of anticipated changes in labor  material and service costs  either through an estimation of such changes  which is reflected in an original price  or through price escalation clauses in its contracts 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal year  international s cash and cash equivalents increased  to  and total debt increased  to  primarily due to the issuance of  principal amount of jrm s senior subordinated notes due and secured borrowings of  on transfers of receivables see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
during this period  international provided cash of  from operating activities and received cash of  from asset disposals and  from returns from investees 
international used cash of  for net purchases of investments   for additions to property  plant and equipment   for dividends on mcdermott international s common and preferred stocks   for repayment of long term debt   for investments in equity investees  and  for the repurchase of a subsidiary s preferred stock to satisfy current and future sinking fund requirements 
cash from asset disposals includes proceeds of  from the sale of international s interest in ccc fabricaciones y construcciones  sa de sa a mexican joint venture  derrick barges  and other assets to global industries  ltd  proceeds of  from the sale of international s shipyard facilities in morgan city  louisiana and certain work in progress and proceeds of  from the sale of a marine vessel by heeremac on behalf of international 
pursuant to an agreement with the majority of its principal insurers  international negotiates and settles products liability asbestos claims from non employees and bills these amounts to the appropriate insurers 
as a result of collection delays inherent in the process  reimbursement is usually delayed for three months or more 
the average amount of these claims historical average of approximately  per claim over the last three years has continued to rise 
claims paid in fiscal year were  of which  has been recovered or is due from insurers 
at march   receivables of  were due from insurers for reimbursement of settled claims 
the increase in amounts classified current for products liability asbestos claims and insurance recoverable at march  reflects management s intention to reduce the level of unpaid asserted claims over the next several quarters 
the number of non employee asbestos claims  which had declined moderately since fiscal year  increased during the second half of fiscal year and the first half of fiscal year  but decreased the second half of fiscal year based on information then currently available  management believed that the increase represented an acceleration in the timing of receipt of claims but did not represent an increase in the total liability 
the number of claims  however  increased during the first nine months of fiscal year and during that period management was investigating and evaluating the basis for the increase 
as a result of this investigation and evaluation  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year international recorded an additional estimated liability for future non employee asbestos claims of  estimated related insurance recoveries of  and a loss of  for estimated future claims for which recovery from insurers was not determined to be probable 
estimated liabilities for pending and future non employee products liability asbestos claims are derived from international s claims history and constitute management s best estimate of such future costs 
settlement of the liability is expected to occur over approximately the next years 
estimated insurance recoveries are based upon analysis of insurers providing coverage of the estimated liabilities 
inherent in the estimate of such liabilities and recoveries are expected trends in claim severity and frequency and other factors  including recoverability from insurers  which may vary significantly as claims are filed and settled 
accordingly  the ultimate loss may differ materially from amounts provided in the consolidated financial statements 
the collection delays and the amount of claims paid for which insurance recovery is not probable have not had a material adverse effect on international s liquidity  and management believes  based on information currently available  that they will not have a material adverse effect on liquidity in the future 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment increased  to  in fiscal year the majority of fiscal year expenditures were to maintain  replace and upgrade existing facilities and equipment 
international has committed to make capital expenditures of approximately  during fiscal at march  and  the babcock wilcox company had sold  with limited recourse  an undivided interest in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable of approximately  and  respectively  under an agreement with a us bank 
during fiscal year  the maximum sales limit available under the agreement was reduced from  to  and is subject to annual renewal 
depending on the amount of qualified accounts receivable available for the pool  the amount sold to the bank can vary but not greater than the maximum sales limit available from time to time 
beginning january   international accounts for these sales as secured borrowings see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
at march  and  mcdermott international and its subsidiaries had available various uncommitted short term lines of credit from banks totaling  and  respectively 
borrowings against these lines of credit at march  and were  and  respectively 
the reduction in borrowings against uncommitted short term lines of credit is primarily due to the collection of the foinaven project receivables and repayment of the project financing debt during the fiscal year 
at march  and  respectively  there were borrowings of  and  under the  unsecured committed revolving credit facility of the babcock wilcox company the b w revolver 
during may and june  the babcock wilcox company repaid all amounts outstanding under the b w revolver 
as a condition to borrowing under the b w revolver  the babcock wilcox company must comply with certain requirements 
in july  these requirements of the b w revolver were amended so that the babcock wilcox company may borrow under this facility in the future 
during fiscal year borrowings by the babcock wilcox company through the b w revolver are expected to be minimal as the babcock wilcox company expects to be able to fund itself from operating cash flow 
jrm is party to an unsecured and committed revolving credit facility the jrm revolver with a group of banks 
there were no borrowings outstanding at march  and under the jrm revolver 
as a condition to borrowing under the jrm revolver  jrm must comply with certain requirements 
presently  jrm cannot satisfy these requirements and cannot borrow under the jrm revolver 
the jrm revolver also limits the amount of funds which jrm can borrow from other sources and jrm is currently at such limits 
however  it is not anticipated jrm will need to borrow funds under the jrm revolver during fiscal year the delaware company and jrm are restricted  as a result of covenants in credit agreements  in their ability to transfer funds to international and its subsidiaries through cash dividends or through unsecured loans or investments 
at march   substantially all of the net assets of the delaware company and jrm were subject to such restrictions 
it is not expected that these restrictions will have any significant effect on mcdermott international s liquidity 
international maintains an investment portfolio of government obligations and other investments 
the fair value of short and long term investments in debt securities at march  was  at march   approximately  fair value of these obligations were pledged to secure a letter of credit in connection with a long term loan and certain reinsurance agreements 
over the past several years  international has entered into certain investments in oil and gas projects in the former soviet union 
in april  international sold its last soviet union oil and gas interest which was in the sakhalin energy investment company ltd  to other members of the consortium 
international received proceeds of approximately  working capital decreased  to  at march  due  in part  to the classification of jrm s guaranteed senior notes as a current liability due to jrm s decision to redeem such notes on july  during fiscal year  jrm issued  principal amount of senior subordinated notes due and received net proceeds of  which were used primarily to repay intercompany indebtedness including interest of approximately  owed to mcdermott international 
mcdermott international used  of the proceeds to reduce short term debt and invested the remainder of the proceeds in its investment portfolio 
during fiscal year  international expects to obtain funds to meet capital expenditure  working capital and debt maturity requirements from operating activities  sales of non strategic assets  cash and cash equivalents  investments in debt securities and short term borrowings 
leasing agreements for equipment  which are short term in nature  are not expected to impact international s liquidity or capital resources 
jrm s joint ventures are largely financed through their own resources  including  in some cases  stand alone borrowing arrangements 
as of the board of directors meeting held november   mcdermott international s quarterly dividends on its common stock were reduced from per share to per share 
its dividend of per share on its series c cumulative convertible preferred stock remained unchanged 
the delaware company s quarterly dividends are per share on the series a cumulative convertible preferred stock and per share on the series b cumulative preferred stock 
mcdermott international s quarterly dividends were per share in the last two quarters in fiscal year and per share in the first two quarters of fiscal year and in fiscal year the delaware company s quarterly dividends were at the same rates in and at march   the ratio of long term debt to total stockholders equity was as compared with at march  international has provided a valuation allowance  at march  for deferred tax assets which cannot be realized through carrybacks and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
management believes that remaining deferred tax assets at march  are realizable through carrybacks and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income and  if necessary  the implementation of tax planning strategies involving the sales of appreciated assets 
uncertainties that affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets are the risk of incurring losses in the future and the possibility of declines in value of appreciated assets involved in identified tax planning strategies 
these factors have been considered in determining the valuation allowance 
management will continue to assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
on october   mcdermott international  inc announced that its board of directors had directed management to implement a series of steps to improve international s financial and operating performance 
management was directed to focus international on its core business lines and dispose of non core businesses and underperforming assets 
core business lines include the power generation and government operations of b w and the marine construction operations of jrm 
management was also directed to realign the operations of b w s power generation group consistent with the current demands of the worldwide power generation market 
this included the rationalization of manufacturing overcapacity and continued reduction in personnel 
finally  management was directed to continue efforts to reduce personnel and other costs at the operating and corporate headquarters of both mcdermott international and jrm 
business and asset disposals associated with this directive have not been completed 
new accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 earnings per share  which is required to be adopted on december  at that time  international will be required to change the method currently used to compute earnings per share and to restate all prior periods 
under the new requirements for calculating basic earnings per share  the dilutive effect of stock options and stock appreciation rights will be excluded 
for the fiscal years  and  the new standard will have no impact on previously reported amounts 
in october  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  environmental remediation liabilities 
the sop provides guidance with respect to the recognition  measurement  and disclosure of environmental remediation liabilities 
international believes that its accounting for environmental remediation liabilities is essentially in compliance with the sop 
international will formally adopt sop in fiscal year  and does not believe the effect of the adoption will be material
