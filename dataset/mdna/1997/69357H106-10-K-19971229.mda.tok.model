in particular  statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to the company s shipment level and profitability  and the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditures requirements may be forward looking statements 
the words expect  anticipate  internal  plan  believe  seek  estimate and similar expressions also are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
this report also contains other forward looking statements 
such statements are not guarantees of future performance  and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause the company s future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
many of such factors are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
readers are accordingly cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements whether in response to new information  future events or otherwise 
important factors that may cause the company s actual results to differ from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
the company s future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
the company s business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply  which often have had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital expenditures  including systems manufactured and marketed by the company 
the company believes that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors will also be subject to similar fluctuations 
also  the recent high rate of technical innovation and resulting improvements in the performance and price of semiconductor devices  which have driven much of the demand for the company s products  could slow  or encounter limits  in the future 
in addition  any other factor adversely affecting the semiconductor industry or particular segments within the semiconductor industry may adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
additional risks and uncertainties include competitive pressures on selling prices  inventory management  including suppliers ability to meet the company s needs in a timely manner  the timing and cancellation of customer orders  changes in product mix  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  the company s ability to increase its manufacturing capacity to meet increased demand while maintaining satisfactory levels of product quality  service levels  and timeliness of deliveries  rapid technological change and introduction of products and technologies by the company s competitors  market acceptance of the company s and its competitors products  the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter  the timing of investments in engineering and development  the company s ability to absorb and manage acquisitions  and risks associated with doing business in asia and europe 
the current financial uncertainty within certain asian country economies could affect the worldwide semiconductor industry 
the impact of this uncertainty could result in delay or cancellation of orders from customers in these countries 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price
