these contracts typically run for a minimum of three years and allow for the customer to exceed the contractual minimums 
these contracts  referred to as placement contracts  are preferred to the sale strategy as the company believes that the potential revenue stream is greater and more profitable 
sterile handpieces and other disposables are included in the per procedure fee 
in countries where health care is not reimbursed by the government or insurance  or where credit risk is high  the heart laser is sold as capital equipment and the related sterile handpieces and other disposables are sold separately for each procedure 
the company sells heart lasers directly and through distributors

in february  the company s premarket approval application pma was filed by the fda 
the company believes this to be the final stage of a definitive process toward fda approval  which is anticipated to occur in with this expectation of fda approval  the company is preparing to increase its production requirements  sales and marketing efforts and overall operating expenses 
in order to be well positioned to meet these upcoming demands and the short term cash flow requirements under the placement strategy  the company is currently exploring both debt and equity opportunities 
unanticipated decreases in operating revenues  increases in expenses  or a delay in the expected fda approval  may adversely impact the company s cash position 
the company may seek additional financing through the issuance and sale of debt or equity securities  bank financing  joint ventures or by other means 
the availability of such financing and the reasonableness of any related terms in comparison to market conditions cannot be assured 
the company believes that periodic operating losses are possible until after such time as the company receives its pma from the fda for the heart laser 
the company submitted its pma application in april although the heart laser has been granted expedited review status by the fda  given the current uncertainties of the time required by the fda to approve a pma application  the company cannot project when  if at all  such approval would be granted 
until pma approval  future profitability will likely be determined by the number of international shipments and the related mix of sales and placements 
in february  the company s pma application was filed by the fda 
the filing of this expedited pma application indicated that the fda is prepared to prioritize and commit its resources to this application through the remaining review process 
no assurance can be given that a pma approval will be granted in  if at all 
in addition  the company must also convince health care professionals  third party payors and the general public of the medical and economic benefits of the heart laser 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in marketing the heart laser or that the company will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis 
at december  the company had us net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income which expire at various dates through  and the company had foreign net operating carryforwards of approximately million 
in addition  various other deferred tax assets have been generated related primarily to intercompany profit  accruals  and research and development tax credits 
since the company believes that as of december  it is more likely than not  that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  no tax benefit for prior year losses and other deferred items has been provided 
these amounts could provide a benefit to the company in the future in profitable years  subject to the expirations noted 
new accounting pronouncement none
