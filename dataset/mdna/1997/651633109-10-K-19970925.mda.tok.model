the level of net interest income is a function of volume  rates and mix of both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income can be adversely affected by changes in interest rate levels as determined by the company s gap position  measured by the differences between the volume of assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing within different future time periods 
interest income total interest and dividend income increased  or  to million in loan income increased  or  as a result of higher volume offset by slightly lower overall yield 
average loans grew million  or  to million in as compared with the decrease in the average loan yield resulted primarily from downward portfolio repricing on residential adjustable rate mortgages due to lower interest rates  which also affected new loan rates 
interest and dividends from securities and federal funds increased  or  in as a result of higher overall volume coupled with a marginally higher yield 
mortgage backed security prepayments have continued to decline which reduces the amortization expense  thereby increasing the yield on the mortgage backed security portfolio 
while average securities declined million  or  average federal funds balances increased million 
the change in average yield resulted from changes in portfolio mix and market interest rates on securities purchased 
interest expense interest expense increased  or  to million in primarily as a result of deposit growth and higher average borrowings  offset in part by slightly lower cost of funds which decreased basis point

provision and allowance for loan losses the company provided  for loan losses in  unchanged from changes in the allowance for loan losses are as follows years ended june  dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year    provision for losses charge offs recoveries balance  end of year    ratio of allowance for loan losses to non performing loans to total gross loans loan loss provision to average loans net recoveries charge offs to average loans the company remains well reserved both against total loans and non performing loans 
during non performing loans decreased million  or  as a result of which  the reserve coverage to non performing loans increased to 
past due performing loans accruing loans days past due have remained relatively stable throughout fiscal year  and at june  were of gross loans 
loan charge offs were modest in  while a large loan loss recovery  of approximately  on a real estate loan previously written down in february further strengthened the reserve 
for a discussion on loan quality see asset quality and portfolio risk 
the bank determines its allowance and provisions for loan losses based upon a detailed evaluation of the loan portfolio through a process which considers numerous factors  including estimated credit losses based upon internal and external portfolio reviews  delinquency levels and trends  estimates of the current value of underlying collateral  concentrations  portfolio volume and mix  changes in lending policy  historical loan loss experience  current economic conditions and examinations performed by regulatory authorities 
determining the level of the allowance at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan portfolio is a continuing event in the light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
in management s judgement the allowance for loan losses at june   is adequate 
should the economic climate deteriorate  borrowers could experience difficulty and the level of non performing loans  charge offs and delinquencies could rise and require increased provisions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies could require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgements of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the bank was examined by the state of connecticut  department of banking  in march and no additions to the allowance were requested as a result of this examination

interest rate sensitivity the company monitors its interest rate risk exposure on a quarterly basis using both traditional gap analysis  to identify short medium and long term interest rate risk positions  and simulation analysis  to measure the amount of short term earnings at risk under rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the following table sets forth the company s interest rate sensitivity position  or gap position  at june   measured in terms of the volume of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing in future time periods 
for the purposes of this analysis  money market deposits have been presented in the within month category and savings and now deposits have been presented in the to months category  although the interest rate elasticity of money market  savings and now deposits cannot be tied to any one time category 
non accrual loans and overdrafts have been presented in the non interest bearing category 
significant variations may exist in the degree of interest rate sensitivity between individual asset and liability types within the repricing periods presented due to differences in their repricing elasticity relative to changes in the general level of interest rates

a liability sensitive gap implies that the company s net interest margin could be adversely affected by a sudden increase in interest rates 
the company structures its loan and securities portfolios to provide for portfolio repricing consistent with its interest rate risk objectives  and to ensure that earnings at risk to short term interest rate fluctuations will not exceed 
a significant factor in determining the company s ability to maintain its net interest margin in a changing interest rate environment is its ability to manage its core deposit rates 
essentially all of the company s deposit base is composed of local retail deposit accounts which tend to be somewhat less sensitive to moderate interest fluctuations than other funding sources and  therefore  provide a reasonably stable and cost effective source of funds 
based on the company s asset liability mix at june   management s simulation analysis of the effects of changing interest rates on net income over a twelve month forecast horizon projects that a gradual basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates over the forecast horizon would result in a net income fluctuation of less then

dividend restrictions the company s ability to pay dividends is dependent on the bank s ability to pay dividends to the company 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by the bank to the company 
under connecticut law a bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend on its common stock except from its net earnings for the current year and retained net profits for the preceding two years 
consequently  the maximum amount of dividends payable by the bank to the company for the year ended june  is  in some instances  further restrictions on dividends may be imposed on the company by the frb 
in october the company resumed dividend payments with the payment of a quarterly cash dividend  following a four year lapse 
in october and the company increased its quarterly cash dividend to and  respectively 
for total dividends of per share were declared 
the company believes that the payment of cash dividends to its shareholders is appropriate  provided that such payment considers the company s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition and does not adversely affect the financial stability of the company or the bank 
the continued payment of cash dividends by the company will be dependent on the company s future core earnings  financial condition and capital needs  regulatory restrictions  and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors of the company
