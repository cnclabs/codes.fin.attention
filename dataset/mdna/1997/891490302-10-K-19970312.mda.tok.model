item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction was a year of expansion for tosco 
tosco acquired the us northeast refining and marketing assets of british petroleum bp in february  and the circle k corporation circle k in may  and entered into an agreement to acquire the west coast refining and marketing division of unocal corporation unocal in december the completed acquisitions and continued growth of tosco s operations provided the basis for tosco s most successful year in terms of revenues  operating contribution  and net income 
tosco s capital structure and credit standing also strengthened in through profitable results of operations and the issuance of million of trust convertible preferred securities at favorable rates and conversion ratios 
tosco achieved investment grade rating by all major rating agencies and made further progress to an unsecured debt structure with an expanded unsecured revolving credit facility 
the ratio of debt non current portion of long term debt to total capitalization improved to  its best since  a period prior to the start of its rapid growth 
common stock was split for in february and tosco announced that future quarterly dividends would be raised to 
per post split share equivalent to 
per pre split share 
acquisitions northeast refining and marketing assets on february   tosco purchased bp s us northeast refining and marketing assets for million  plus the value of inventories 
under the purchase agreement  tosco obtained a year exclusive license  with various renewal options  to market gasoline and diesel fuels under the bp brand in the us northeast 
bp retained environmental obligations relating to the trainer refinery and other properties included in the sale 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
circle k on may   tosco completed its acquisition of circle k for a total consideration of million in cash and approximately million post split shares of tosco common stock 
circle k has approximately  company controlled convenience stores  approximately  of which sell gasoline 
with the acquisition of circle k  tosco is the largest operator of company controlled convenience stores in the united states

operating contribution sales less cost of sales was million in compared to million in  an increase of million due to improved refinery operations million and expanded retail operations million 
refinery operating contribution increased by million to million for due to improved refining margins partially offset by higher refinery operating costs and lower production volumes 
refining operating contribution per barrel  which fluctuated significantly during the year  averaged for the year  an improvement of from operating contribution for benefited from the strong east coast refining margins due to cold weather in the first quarter of  while operating contribution for was negatively impacted by extremely weak refining margins and extensive scheduled refinery turnaround maintenance at the avon and ferndale refineries 
the improved operating contribution of was partially offset by higher refinery operating costs and declines in production levels 
higher refinery operating costs were primarily due to the trainer refinery acquired in a shutdown state in february  increased energy costs  and higher depreciation costs 
raw material throughput for declined by  barrels per day b d to  b d 
however  production of clean products increased by  b d to  b d 
production of clean products was aided by the completion of the solvent deasphalting unit sda at the bayway refinery in august the sda processes low value residual fuel to produce feedstock for the cat cracker  the refinery s principal gasoline manufacturing unit  and reduces the amount of high cost  partially refined feedstocks that bayway purchases from third parties 
operating contribution from tosco s retail operations increased by million to million for  primarily because of the acquisition of circle k 
retail volume of fuel sales approximately doubled to billion gallons  and the blended fuel margin increased by cents per gallon to cents per gallon 
the increase in fuel margin was primarily attributable to the higher proportion of sales from company operated stores 
fuel margins achieved at company operated stores are typically higher than margins on branded fuel sales to the dealer jobber channel of trade 
operating contribution from retail operations also improved due to expanded merchandise sales of approximately billion for with margins of 
these improved margins were reduced by station operating and other costs of the approximately  convenience stores acquired in the circle k acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were million in compared to million in this increase of million was due to tosco s expanded operations and higher levels of incentive compensation due to improved operating results 
in june  tosco entered into a three year agreement with a financial institution to sell  on a revolving basis  up to million of an undivided percentage ownership interest in a designated pool of accounts receivable the receivable transfer agreement 
the receivable transfer agreement was amended in may to increase the program to million  and again in december to million 
costs of the receivable transfer agreement which are less than interest costs would be on equivalent borrowings under tosco s revolving credit facility are included in cost of sales 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense increased in  despite the reduction in interest costs resulting from the receivable transfer agreement  due to higher debt levels related to tosco s expanded operations and higher price levels of raw materials and products 
income taxes in increased by million to million due to improved pretax income and a higher effective tax rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements

per fully diluted post split share on sales of billion for compared to net income of million 
per fully diluted post split share on sales of billion for results of operations for include a restructuring charge totaling million million after tax

results of operations for include the reversal of s million million after tax  
per post split share writedown of lifo inventories due to the recovery of prices during and a million million after tax  
per post split share environmental cost accrual for probable investigative and remedial liabilities at former operating locations 
tosco generated an operating contribution sales less cost of sales for of million  an increase of million over the increase was primarily attributable to the excellent production operations  lower production costs  and moderately higher east coast operating margins  which more than offset declines in west coast refinery operating margins  and the continued strong performance of expanded retail operations 
consolidated refinery production for improved over due to the achievement of record production levels at the avon and bayway refineries  which more than offset the reduced production levels at the ferndale refinery 
consolidated raw material throughput increased by  b d to  b d  while production of clean products increased by  b d to  b d 
total production also increased by  b d to  b d 
this increased production was achieved despite the shut down of the avon cat cracker  its principal gasoline production unit  and the ferndale refinery  for days and days  respectively  for major turnaround maintenance 
bayway s record production results were primarily attributable to expanded crude distillation capacity completed in and record unit production rates of the cat cracker  the world s largest and bayway s principal gasoline production unit 
the cat cracker was shut down for scheduled turnaround maintenance in east coast margins improved by 
per barrel for the year  primarily during the second half of  due to higher sales prices 
operating margins for the year were hurt by the exceptionally weak market conditions of the first quarter of  caused by the combined impact of a surplus of heating oil and poor gasoline markets 
operating margins improved during the balance of the year as demand strengthened and uncertainty over the introduction of reformulated gasoline rfg subsided 
west coast margins declined as excess supply in highly competitive markets depressed product prices  particularly in the first quarter of in response to continuing poor operating margins  tosco implemented a restructuring program to reduce costs and increase efficiency 
the restructuring charge of million  recorded in the first and second quarters of  was primarily for the then anticipated severance costs of approximately people at the avon refinery and related support locations 
retail operations generated an operating contribution of million for  an increase of million from retail volumes sold increased by million gallons to billion gallons due to the acquisition of retail operations in northern california and arizona in august and december  respectively 
retail gasoline margins remained the same at approximately 
per gallon for and sg a increased by million to million due to tosco s expanded retail operations and higher levels of incentive compensation due to higher levels of operating income before special items  partially offset by certain benefit recoveries 
sg a for was reduced by insurance recoveries of million related to now settled litigation with the predecessor owners of the avon refinery over environmental matters and million related to a retroactive adjustment of prior year medical costs based on favorable claim experience 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest expense increased in by million  despite the reduction in interest costs resulting from the receivable transfer agreement effective june  due to higher debt levels related to tosco s expanded operations 
the provision for income taxes for approximated the amount despite lower pre tax income  because the tax provision for included recognition of revised income tax benefits of million related to tosco s discontinued fertilizer operations 
outlook results of operations are primarily determined by the operating efficiency of the refineries  and refining and retail fuel margins 
refinery production for the first quarter of will be negatively impacted by a january accident at the avon hydrocracking unit  the scheduled turnaround at the avon coker unit  and reduced throughput rates at the bayway refinery in january due to unscheduled major maintenance 
on january   a fire and explosion occurred at avon s hydrocracking unit a gasoline production unit 
no other units at the refinery were damaged 
the hydrocracking unit remains shutdown while investigations into the cause of the accident continue 
the date the unit will return to service is not known 
the accident is not expected to significantly affect the scheduled early march completion date of the fluid coker  which was shutdown in early january for scheduled turnaround maintenance 
tosco has altered its operations to optimize production while these units are shutdown 
tosco has adequate property and business interruption insurance that should mitigate the impact of the accident on results of operations and cash flow 
at the bayway refinery  the cat cracker was shutdown for unscheduled major maintenance in january the cat cracker returned to normal operations in late january 
there are no other significant turnarounds scheduled at tosco s operating refineries for the shut down trainer refinery  which is currently undergoing a million refurbishment and modernization program  is also expected to restart by the summer of refining and retail fuel margins were extremely poor in january margins  especially on the west coast  improved in february but remain weak overall 
merchandise margins remain consistent 
tosco is not able to predict the short term level or trend of refinery and retail fuel operating margins because of the uncertainties associated with oil markets 
in view of uncertain operating margins and highly competitive markets  tosco is committed to improving its results by lowering costs in all areas of operation without compromising safety  reliability  or environmental compliance 
acquisition of products company on december   tosco executed a definitive agreement for its previously announced acquisition of the operating assets of the products company  the west coast refining and marketing division of unocal the products acquisition 
the assets to be acquired from unocal include two petroleum refining systems  comprised of four sites in california with an aggregate throughput capacity of approximately  barrels per day  a retail gasoline system consisting of approximately  branded gasoline stations approximately  of which are company controlled  which currently sells over  barrels of gasoline and diesel fuel per day  a distribution system comprised of company owned oil storage terminals  three modern american flag  deadweight ton tankers   miles of crude oil and product pipeline  the worldwide rights to the and union brands together with the distinctive orange ball logo in the petroleum refining and marketing businesses  except for pre existing license grants relating to truckstops and to uno ven  and unocal s lubricants manufacturing  distribution  and marketing business 
tosco believes these assets provide a valuable complement to its existing west coast system 
the purchase price of the products acquisition will be approximately billion  plus the value of inventories as of the closing date 
in addition  unocal will be entitled to participate in future profits in the event retail market conditions and carb gasoline premiums improve over the next seven years  up to a maximum of million 
for a period of years  unocal will be responsible for all environmental liabilities arising out of or relating to the period prior to closing  except that tosco will pay the first million of such environmental liabilities each year  plus of any amount in excess of million per year  with unocal paying the remaining each year 
the aggregate maximum amount that tosco may have to pay in total for the year period for such environmental liabilities is limited to million 
environmental liabilities assumed will be accrued for in the opening balance sheet 
tosco will fund this acquisition with a combination of term debt  bank debt  and equity 
in january  tosco issued million of term debt and expanded its revolving credit facility by million to billion and deposited a combination of cash and letters of credit into escrow in accordance with the terms of the definitive agreement 
tosco contemplates the issuance of common stock in the public markets in march to finance the balance of the purchase price and strengthen its balance sheet 
shareholders of tosco  at a special meeting of shareholders held on february   approved an amendment to increase the authorized number of shares of tosco common stock from million shares to million shares 
the increase in authorized shares was necessary to complete the products acquisition and the for stock split 
consummation of the products acquisition  while still subject to a number of conditions  including governmental regulatory approval  is scheduled to close around march  tosco expects the products acquisition to be additive to earnings per share after the combined operations are fully integrated through substantial cost savings  efficiencies  and synergies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash flows as summarized in the consolidated statement of cash flows  cash and cash equivalents increased by million during as cash provided by operating and financing activities of million and million  respectively  exceeded cash used in investing activities of million 
net cash provided by operating activities of million was from cash earnings of million net income plus depreciation  amortization  and deferred income taxes  plus a decrease in working capital of million  and million from other sources 
the decrease in working capital is primarily due to the sale of receivables pursuant to the receivable transfer agreement which was expanded to million in december 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million the acquisition of circle k million  capital additions million  the acquisition of the bp northeast refining and marketing assets million  and other items million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million as proceeds from notes of million and company obligated  mandatorily redeemable  convertible preferred securities trust convertible trust securities of million exceeded the retirement of million of pre acquisition debt of circle k  net repayments under short term bank lines and the revolving credit facility of million  dividend payments of million  and other items of million 
liquidity liquidity as measured by cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  deposits  and unused credit facilities increased by million during as cash and cash equivalents increased by million  marketable securities and deposits increased by million  and unused credit facilities increased by million 
at december   liquidity totaled million 
in january  tosco increased its cash and credit availability by million to billion 
in january  tosco filed a shelf registration statement providing for the issuance of up to billion aggregate principal amount of its securities 
the securities to be issued may consist of one or more series of debentures  notes or other uncollateralized forms of indebtedness  common stock  preferred stock  and preferred stock represented by depository shares 
such securities may be offered  separately or together  in amounts and at prices and terms to be set forth in one or more supplements to the shelf registration statement 
the revolving credit facility  as well as funds potentially available from the issuance of securities  provides tosco with adequate resources to meet its expected liquidity demands  including required debt payments and liquidity requirements associated with the products acquisition  for at least the next twelve months 
capital expenditures on february   tosco completed the purchase of bp s us northeast refining and marketing assets  and on may   tosco completed its acquisition of circle k 
additionally  tosco spent million on budgeted capital projects in  primarily at the avon and bayway refineries and for retail assets 
refinery capital spending programs were for the completion of projects to meet reformulated fuel specifications  compliance with environmental regulations and permits  personnel process safety programs  and operating flexibility and reliability projects including the tie in of the sda at bayway 
retail capital spending was focused on integrating operations and enhancing existing sites 
as discussed under the acquisition of products company  the products acquisition will be funded by a combination of term debt  bank debt  and equity 
tosco expects to fund its other refinery and retail capital expenditures from cash provided by operations  available credit  and other resources 
in view of the pending products acquisition  capital spending for retail operations will be refocused on enhancing existing retail sites and integrating operations after the acquisition 
capitalization at december   total shareholders equity was billion  a million increase from the december  balance of million 
this increase was due to the issuance of  post split shares of common stock for million  net income of million less common stock dividends of million  and other items of million 
debt  including current maturities and short term bank borrowings  increased by million to million  due to tosco s acquisitions 
the ratio of debt non current portion of long term debt to total capitalization decreased from to due to profitable results of operations and the issuance of million of trust convertible preferred securities in december see note to the consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation has been less significant during recent years because of the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states 
raw material costs  energy costs  and labor costs are important components of tosco s costs 
any or all of these components could be increased by inflation  with a possible adverse effect on profitability  especially in high inflation periods when raw material and energy cost increases generally lead finished product prices 
in addition  a rapid escalation of raw material and finished product prices could result in credit restrictions if working capital requirements exceed the maximum availability under the revolving credit facility 
risk management tosco uses a variety of strategies to reduce commodity price  interest  and operational risks 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  tosco  at times and when able  uses futures contracts to lock in what it believes to be favorable margins on a varying portion of refinery production by taking offsetting long obligation to buy at a fixed price positions in crude oil and short obligation to deliver at a fixed price positions in gasoline and heating oil futures and forward contracts 
this strategy hedges tosco s exposure to fluctuations in refining margins and therefore tends to reduce the volatility of operating results 
in addition  tosco enters into swap contracts with counterparties to hedge sales prices of residual fuels production 
futures and forward contracts were also used to a lesser extent to hedge inventories stored for future sale and to hedge against adverse price movements between the cost of domestic and foreign crude oil 
at december   tosco had hedged approximately of its expected first quarter production at acceptable historical margins 
tosco manages its interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt 
floating rate debt  primarily borrowings under the revolving credit facility  which currently provides up to billion of uncollateralized revolving credit availability  is used to finance tosco s working capital requirements 
existing fixed rate debt consists primarily of million uncollateralized noncallable notes issued in july to repay indebtedness under the previously outstanding collateralized revolving credit facility  million of mortgage bonds issued in and to refinance previously outstanding floating rate bank debt and to finance the acquisition of capital assets including the acquisition of the bayway refinery  million uncollateralized noncallable notes issued in may to finance a portion of the circle k purchase price  a million real estate installment purchase note  and various capital lease obligations 
tosco carries insurance policies on insurable risks  which it believes to be appropriate at commercially reasonable rates 
while tosco believes that it is adequately insured  future losses could exceed insurance policy limits or  under adverse interpretations  be excluded from coverage 
future liability or costs  if any  incurred under such circumstances would have to be paid out of general corporate funds  if available 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of tosco s strategy to reduce credit risk
