dca has a suggested retail price to the consumer of per bottle 
o the euro line  which has lower price points than the dca line  is also marketed in traditional retail chain stores both in the united states and canada as well as latin america 
the euro line  first introduced in  is the second largest fragrance line of the company and until fiscal had been the company s principal brand in the wholesale market 
the company s new royal selections brand  as discussed below  is now targeted to the wholesale market  replacing the euro line 
to strengthen the euro line s franchise in the retail channel  its packaging was redesigned in the latter part of fiscal to enhance its image and position 
euro fragrances suggested retail prices range from to per bottle 
o in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company developed a new line  royal selections  designed to recapture a significant part of the wholesale trade class 
within one year of introduction the royal selection brand has become the largest brand in the company and a market leader 
this line set new standards for the industry in packaging and product innovation 
in august a significant line extension  royal nature  was introduced with seven new original fragrances emulating mother nature 
fragrances such as peach  pear  and very berry attract a younger teen audience  a new market segment for the company 
generally these younger consumers find nature type fragrances more appealing than traditional designer alternative fragrances 
royal selections is competitively priced  and couples that with unsurpassed quality packaging and merchandising support 
this line was introduced at the beginning of fiscal and sells to consumers at a suggested retail price range of to per bottle 
o in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company developed a new fragrance brand called regal collections  focusing on major new opportunities in retail channels of distribution 
regal collections has a limited number of designer alternative fragrance best sellers and will retail between to per bottle 
this attractively packaged brand is aimed at mass volume retailers including food accounts 
shipments commenced august o the premiere line is a budget price brand that is oriented toward dollar stores and other budget price retailers 
this line of designer alternative fragrances was newly re staged at the end of fiscal by increasing the bottle size and redesigning all packaging 
sales of the redesigned product began in early fiscal at the same price points as previously sold  providing increased value in comparison to competition 
the consumer can purchase fragrances in this line in a suggested retail price range of to per bottle 
in fiscal  the company discontinued everscent  a minor budget priced fragrance brand  and sold or disposed of related inventory 
the company believes that to successfully market a fragrance product line  one must identify a market niche and then fill that niche with a value priced  quality product presented in attractive bottles  cartons and displays 
all of the company s fragrance lines feature quality glass bottles and caps designed in various unique shapes and styles 
the company s fragrances are packaged in colorful cartons designed with the latest technology to appear attractive to the consumer 
all fragrances are developed by the company s and the sheth group s expert perfumers as alternatives to the most popular  nationally branded  designer fragrances 
they are sold  however  at a fraction of the original designer fragrance s retail price to satisfy the needs of the consumers in specific niche markets 
the company also develops  markets and distributes a limited number of its own original fragrances non designer alternative fragrances in the us and latin america 
prior to the introduction of new or improved fragrances  market evaluation and consumer testing is conducted by the company with selective testing also done by independent outside laboratories 
the company believes that the success of these products is dependent on the company correctly identifying the needs of a particular market niche and then  ultimately  on the consumers acceptance of the product 
life cycles of products vary significantly  with some being successfully marketed for more than five years  whereas other products may fail to gain consumer acceptance and be discontinued within a shorter period of time 
the company believes that the success of the company s products in the market place is largely dependent on the amount and quality of retail advertising and promotion original designers provide for their brands  the appeal of the scent itself  and the merchandising and trial programs that the company develops to accelerate consumer awareness 
each of the company s five fragrance product lines has  or will have  companion products  which are discussed below in other products 
the company anticipates revenue growth in its fragrance lines in fiscal as the company strengthens its marketing programs and targets specific products at specific market niches 
the streamlining and upgrading of the euro and premiere lines  increased consumer acceptance of the dca line and the continued rapid growth of the royal selections fragrance line including the royal nature fragrance line extensions are expected to favorably contribute to sales growth 
the recently launched regal collections line had been received well in its targeted market  and it is expected to contribute to fiscal sales growth 
during fiscal the company plans to sell other fragrance lines manufactured by core sheth family affiliates outside the us  into latin america primarily to the retail sector 
these entries are anticipated to expand the company s market share by offering distinctive original non designer alternative brands into those markets with value benefits not presently offered by leading competitors 
other products the company markets numerous complementary products within each fragrance line such as deodorant sticks  dusting powders  shaker talcs  trial travel sizes  fragrance scented candles and gift sets 
in most cases  these companion products are marketed as designer alternatives and are value priced significantly below the prices of the national brands 
the company markets under the brand names of dca and gina cosmetics  proprietary lines of cosmetics including nail  lip color  eye products  and other cosmetic items  all of which are manufactured by related parties 
cosmetics sold under the dca brand are premium quality lip and nail products designed as alternatives to original designer products 
the dca products are sold primarily in chain stores at prices significantly less than the original designer s price 
cosmetic products under the gina cosmetics line are geared to price conscious consumers and are primarily marketed in the wholesale class of trade and in dollar stores 
the apple line of lip and eye cosmetic pencils  which is manufactured by the company  is marketed and distributed in assorted colors and sizes 
private label cosmetic pencils are also produced for selected customers  including an affiliate of the core sheth families 
with the exception of cosmetic pencils  new  redesigned  or replacement cosmetics or specialty toiletries  are developed by the company s suppliers at the request of the company 
the company believes that like fragrances  selecting the right cosmetic or toiletry products for a particular market segment and acceptance by the consumer play a large role in the success or failure of any particular product 
the company believes that revenues for both the complementary products to the fragrance lines and cosmetics will increase in fiscal such growth is expected to result from increases in the existing lines  the addition of new products  and further strengthening of our distribution network 
customers the company distributes its products to more than  customers  including wholesalers  distributors  drug and grocery chains  mass merchandisers and specialty chain stores located primarily in north and south america 
these customers represent over  outlets for the company s products 
the company markets its products through company sales personnel located in various markets and through a network of independent sales representatives 
the company has invested heavily in developing the mature us retail markets and in starting to develop the emerging mass markets in latin america 
the company believes that the customer base in the mass latin american markets fit the company s target customer profile and presents an opportunity for future growth 
the company has focused the expansion of the customer base in the us on creating and repositioning products to better meet the needs of its existing channels of distribution and in gaining entrance into certain new channels 
a major focus of investment in fiscal has been on developing customer bases in the most populous countries in latin america mexico and brazil 
this development was facilitated by establishing sales and distribution operations in those countries in fiscal and  respectively 
the company services other countries in latin america through regional and national distributors within the various countries 
an entity of the core sheth families is the national distributor in argentina 
these distributors are primarily supplied by the company s texas distribution center that also services the united states and canadian markets 
sales to customers in the united states were   and  million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
for the years ended august   august   and  million of net sales  million of net sales  and million of net sales  respectively  were exported directly to foreign customers or sold through the company s subsidiaries in mexico and brazil 
certain of the sales to us customers are ultimately resold outside of the us the amount of these indirect export sales cannot be determined as the company does not have access to its customers sales information 
as a significant portion of the company s products are sold directly or indirectly into the latin american market  there are certain factors such as political and economic conditions that could have an adverse effect on these sales 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations potential adverse effects on results of operations for future periods for a specific discussion of those risks 
the north and south america markets will continue to be the focus of the company s marketing strategy as other core sheth families affiliates distribute similar products throughout the rest of the world 
the company anticipates some increase in sales outside north and south america in fiscal  primarily in the newer royal selections and dca product lines  and principally to core sheth families affiliates 
the company is not dependent upon a single or a few customers  and the loss of a single or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in fiscal   and no single customer accounted for more than ten percent of the company s total sales 
suppliers at present  the company purchases the glass containers for its fragrances from european glass manufacturers 
if these products were unavailable from one of these suppliers  the company believes that it could purchase such products from other suppliers without any significant delays 
in addition  the company purchases specially blended fragrance compounds principally from a core sheth families affiliate in france 
in the event that the supplier was unable to provide the compounds  the company could suffer minor manufacturing delays until the primary supplier could be replaced by another core sheth families affiliate or a secondary source 
the company s ability to satisfy sales orders for its fragrance products is directly dependent on its ability to manufacture these products 
if the company were physically unable to manufacture its products  and inventory and demand levels were normal  the effect on the company would in general be minimal as core sheth families affiliates and others have similar manufacturing facilities available to support the company 
however  in instances where demand for fragrances was strong and the company had inadequate inventory levels  the company would be adversely impacted 
the inability to manufacture cosmetic pencils at its texas facility until a secondary source could be located would have a relatively minor adverse effect 
the company is dependent on the supply of cosmetics  other than cosmetic pencils  from core sheth families affiliates 
if any of these companies were to cease or be unable to supply these cosmetic products  the lack of such products could have an adverse effect on the company until secondary suppliers could be located 
patents and trademarks the company and a core sheth families affiliate own or have applied for  substantially all of the product name trademarks for the fragrance and cosmetic products sold by the company 
the company is dependent on the continued use of these trademarks  however  the cessation of the company s right to use such trademarks of the core sheth families affiliate would not have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
backlog of orders the company had no substantial backlog of orders at the end of each of fiscal years  and at the end of fiscal year  the company s backlog increased over prior years from to million for fiscal years ended and  respectively 
raw materials the company s raw material inventories support the fragrance and cosmetic pencil manufacturing operations 
the principal components of that inventory are currently purchased from limited or single sources of supply 
management believes the cessation of supply for the fragrance components from any of the primary suppliers could be replaced by a core sheth families affiliate or a secondary source with minimal difficulties 
environmental laws in the opinion of management  compliance by the company with federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment has had no material effect upon the company s capital expenditures  earnings or competitive condition 
the company has reformulated certain of its products to meet the requirements of the california air resources board  see legal proceedings 
competition in the fragrance and cosmetics industry the fragrance and cosmetics industry is characterized by intense competition  particularly in the us while pricing and terms are the principal factors in competition  product quality  presentation  merchandising and advertising programs  and customer service incorporating available inventories and prompt delivery are also very important additional competitive features in the overall industry 
principal competitors in designer alternative fragrances include jean philippe fragrances  inc  paris designs  inc  and parfums de coeur  and in budget cosmetics  artmatic usa cosmetics  wet n wild  and jordana cosmetics corporation 
while the company is a significant participant in the value oriented designer alternative fragrance market and has had historically many of the resources of the core sheth families available to it  the company is a relatively small participant in the total fragrance and cosmetics industry 
many of the other companies in the industry  including virtually all large mass advertised brand manufacturers such as unilever  revlon  l oreal  benckiser  and renaissance cosmetics  inc are well established and have been in existence for a significantly longer period of time than the company 
such companies have higher leverage and resources such as financial  marketing  research  manufacturing  and personnel  substantially greater than the company will have available in the foreseeable future 
historically  however  these large manufacturers have not sought to compete in the same value oriented markets in which the company participates 
inventory the company maintains finished goods inventory at its texas  florida  mexico and brazil warehouse facilities to meet the demands of its customers 
raw material and work in process inventories related to manufacturing of fragrances and cosmetic pencils are located at the pleasanton  texas manufacturing facility 
seasonality the company s business has historically been subject to seasonal factors relating to calendar year end holidays  which has resulted in increased net sales in the first and fourth quarters of the company s fiscal year 
the company believes that with its range of products  distribution channels  and promotional activity  it should over time be able to reduce some of the differences between quarters  however  the nature of the fragrance market will result in a continuation of the pattern 
employees the company employs approximately regular employees and during peak production periods the company utilizes temporary or seasonal employees to augment its workforce 
during the past two fiscal peak production periods the company has utilized up to seasonal employees 
none of the company s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and management believes that the company s relationship with its employees is satisfactory

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal tristar markets and distributes products to wholesalers  distributors  chain stores  specialty chains  mass merchandisers  and independent retail stores in various markets throughout north and south america 
net sales for the fiscal year ended august  were  an increase of  compared to net sales of  in the fiscal year ended august  the increase is primarily attributable to the success of the royal selections line of fragrances which was introduced in early fiscal the royal selections line was developed for the wholesale market and reversed the prior years trend in that market channel  achieving success in both the us and latin america 
somewhat offsetting this increase was a loss of sales in the euro line and the dca line 
while not quantifiable  the company also lost sales due to the lack of sufficient production capability to satisfy the entire demand for its products in fiscal the company believes that sales will increase in all channels of distribution in fiscal primarily as a result of adding additional manufacturing capability in the first quarter of fiscal  continued strong demand for the royal selections fragrance line  opportunity with the increased manufacturing capability to market the redesigned budget priced premiere fragrance line  and continued growth of the euro fragrance line in the retail store channel 
sales in both the us and latin america are expected to benefit from the aforementioned factors 
overall  the company s direct exports increased to  of net sales  in fiscal compared to  of net sales  in fiscal the increase in direct exports is largely due to the success of the royal selections fragrance line 
in brazil  the company continued the development of formal channels of distribution after establishing sales and warehouse facilities in early fiscal while the growth of the brazilian market continues to be slower than anticipated  the company believes that the market presents a strategic opportunity for growth in sales in the future 
during fiscal  sales in mexico returned to the levels that were in existence prior to the nuevo peso devaluation in fiscal the success of the royal selections fragrance line combined with the company s strategy to formalize distribution of the euro line in mexico servicing retail outlets through the company s warehouse in mexico city resulted in the improved sales 
the company believes that export sales will continue to increase in fiscal included in export sales were sales of  in fiscal and  in fiscal to core sheth families affiliates 
see business suppliers and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
approximately of the growth in sales resulted from increased sales in the fragrance lines 
the new royal selections fragrance line along with higher sales in the redesigned premiere line and the newly introduced regal collections line accounted for the fragrance lines growth 
sales growth outside the fragrance lines was principally realized in increased cosmetic pencil sales 
of the net sales in fiscal  approximately  or  resulted from the sale of products purchased from related parties as finished goods 
for fiscal  comparable numbers were  or  in addition  fragrance and other products manufactured and sold by the company included certain components that were purchased from related parties

tristar s gross profit both in dollar terms and as a percentage of sales increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal comparable numbers were  or  in fiscal and  or  in fiscal factors which contributed to this increase were the increase in sales  lower level of low margin sales of discontinued product and product lines in fiscal  a change in the product mix sold moving to higher margin products and lower costs associated with the introduction and manufacturing of a new product line 
the company believes that gross profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal will improve over those of fiscal  primarily as a result of improved manufacturing efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased in fiscal to  from the fiscal level of  the increase was primarily attributed to expenses associated with the development of the chain markets in the united states and the introduction and marketing of the royal selections product line 
as a percentage of sales  sg a was in fiscal compared to in fiscal management believes that sg a will increase in dollar terms  while decreasing as a percentage of sales  in fiscal as the company meets continued customer demands and as it builds on investments in products and also markets what were developed in prior years 
interest expense decreased by  in fiscal from the level of  this decrease is primarily attributable to the conversion of certain subordinated debt into preferred stock 
the decrease was partially offset by increased average revolving credit agreement borrowings 
the company believes that interest expense will be higher in fiscal as a result of expected increased borrowing levels under the revolving credit line  establishing a larger term loan  and a new capital equipment lending arrangement to allow the company to increase its manufacturing capability 
fiscal other expenses included  of expenses related to the amortization of the warrant valuation asset and  of litigation expenses arising from events related to the shareholder litigation 
these respective expenses in fiscal were  and  the company recorded income tax expense of  in fiscal which compared to an expense of  in fiscal the fiscal amount includes  of deferred tax expense as a result of management s reassessment of the realizability of its deferred tax assets under the guidelines of statement financial accounting standards no

par value series b preferred stock 
the series b preferred stock has cumulative preferred dividends of per share and a preferred liquidation distribution of per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
each share of the series b preferred stock is convertible at the option of nevell  into four shares of the company s common stock 
the company can redeem the shares of series b preferred stock at any time for cash of per share per common share  plus all accrued and unpaid dividends 
on february   the closing bid price of the company s common stock as reported by the nasdaq was at that date  the series b preferred stock carried a beneficial conversion feature of  the difference between the conversion price and the closing bid price per share of common stock

this charge has also been recorded to retained earnings in a manner consistent with that for the beneficial conversion feature described above 
potential adverse effects on results of operations for future periods the results for fiscal could be adversely affected by each or all of the following factors latin america economies 
growth in sales  or even the maintenance of existing sales levels  as well as the collection of accounts receivable in certain latin american countries including mexico depend to a large extent on the economic health and political stability of those countries 
any deterioration in the economic or political stability in such countries could adversely affect sales and the collectability of accounts receivable 
mexican market 
the company believes that some of its customers based in the united states sell the company s products as well as the products of other companies to purchasers who  in turn  may attempt to import goods into mexico without full payment of applicable mexican taxes and customs duties 
enhanced enforcement efforts by mexican authorities may have an adverse effect on the company s sales to such customers 
supply of products 
the company s ability to manufacture and to satisfy consumer demand for fragrances is dependent on the supply of certain components from single sources which include related parties 
any inability of these vendors to meet the company s requirements could have an adverse effect on the company s results until an alternative source could be found and or developed 
in addition  the company is dependent on the supply of cosmetic products  other than cosmetic pencils  from core sheth families affiliates 
if such affiliates were to cease or be unable to supply these cosmetic products  the lack of these products would have an adverse effect on the company until a secondary supplier could be located 
new markets 
the company continues to develop and expand sales and marketing operations in latin america 
in the process  the company incurs significant expenses in order to establish a marketing presence and an economically viable amount of sales 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in those endeavors nor that it will recover its initial expenses and start up costs 
in addition  certain countries from time to time impose strict import restrictions and high levels of taxes on imports  all of which could affect the success of sales and marketing activities and also affect the profitability of such activities 
internal revenue service 
in february  the internal revenue service the irs concluded its examination of the company s tax returns submitted for fiscal years  and the irs proposed adjustments disallowing the deductions of payments made in the settlement of the class action litigation and certain related legal and professional fees 
the company is in discussions with the irs on these issues and will appeal the proposed adjustments if necessary 
if the company is unsuccessful in its discussions or ultimately in an appeal  it will be required to pay taxes from prior years and related interest thereon exceeding  and it will lose a significant amount of its existing net operating loss carryforward benefits 
no accrual for the impact of the proposed irs adjustment has been recorded in the accompanying financial statements as the company does not believe it is probable that the irs will prevail in this matter 
at this time  it is not known whether  or to what degree  the above factors will have a material adverse impact on the company s fiscal results 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal within the following discussion and analysis  financial information relating to fiscal years reflects the financial results of the combined entities of tristar and eurostar  which were merged on august  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the combination was treated in a manner similar to a pooling of interests 
net sales for the fiscal year ended august  were  an increase of  compared to net sales of  for the fiscal year ended august  the increase was primarily attributable to the development of the drug and grocery chain market utilizing the new dca product line as well as increased sales in mexico  brazil  and other us chains  specialty chains  and mass merchandisers 
somewhat offsetting these increases was a loss of sales in the rest of latin america and in the us wholesale channel 
the loss in the us wholesale channel was primarily due to increased competition  a maturation of that market  a decrease in purchases by customers who ultimately distributed the company s products into latin america  and as a result of repositioning the euro fragrance line outside of the wholesale channel in the latter part of fiscal in anticipation of the introduction of the new royal selections fragrance line into that channel in early fiscal overall  the company s direct exports decreased to  of net sales  in fiscal compared to  of net sales  in fiscal the decrease in direct exports was largely due to political and economic uncertainties in certain latin america countries 
in brazil  the company initiated the development of formal channels of distribution after establishing sales and warehouse facilities in early fiscal during fiscal  the company experienced an increase in the sales that were lost in mexico after the economic and political effects of the nuevo peso devaluation in fiscal  which severely affected the purchasing power of the mexican population 
after the devaluation  the company embarked on a strategy to formalize distribution of the euro line in mexico servicing retail outlets primarily through the company s warehouse in mexico city 
while sales growth was achieved under this distribution strategy  the economic and political pressures continued in fiscal and limited such growth 
sales in the rest of latin america were down in comparison to fiscal  primarily as a result of economic and political conditions in several of those countries 
included in export sales were sales of  in fiscal and  in fiscal to core sheth families affiliates 
see business suppliers and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
approximately two thirds of the growth in sales resulted from increased sales in the fragrance lines 
the new dca fragrance line along with higher sales in the two discontinued fragrance lines  club exclusif and euro elegance  contributed to the growth in sales 
the discontinued lines were sold at prices significantly below list price  therefore generating additional sales  but at reduced margins 
the euro line and the premiere line remained essentially constant in fiscal in comparison to fiscal levels 
sales growth outside the fragrance lines was principally realized in increased cosmetic pencil sales and in sales of the new dca cosmetic line

selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased in fiscal to  from the fiscal level of  the increase was attributed to expenses associated with the introduction of the new dca product line  costs to develop new channels of distribution  costs to enter those channels  growth in support of existing sales channels  and increased support in other functions within the company 
as a percentage of sales  sg a was in fiscal compared to in fiscal fiscal sg a included expenses incurred in the relocation of the pencil manufacturing operations from south carolina to texas and an expense of  to reduce the book value of the plant and surrounding land in south carolina to their estimated net realizable value 
interest expense increased by  in fiscal from the level of  this increase was primarily attributable to increased average short term borrowings 
fiscal expenses included merger related expenses of  litigation expenses arising from events related to the shareholder litigation of  and  of expenses related to the amortization of the warrant valuation asset 
these respective expenses in fiscal were   and in fiscal  the company received a court approved distribution of  from the proceeds of an executive liability and indemnification policy owned by the company
