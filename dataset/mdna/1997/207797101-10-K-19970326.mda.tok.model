item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
liquidity and capital resources during the first two quarters of the dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan drip provided over  of new equity capital  increasing the common stock equity component of the company s capitalization to  up from in to assist the company in maintaining a equity to debt ratio  the company modified its drip to give the company increased financial flexibility through the option of being able to provide drip shares through open market purchases and negotiated transactions  in addition to the previous method of issuing new shares 
to meet the drip requirements in the second half of the company chose to purchase shares on the open market 
these purchases allowed the company to maintain the equity to debt ratio  and have been financed with short term debt  a less expensive form of financing than issuance of equity for the company at this time 
utility plant additions were financed through cash provided by operating activities  funds received from others  funds provided by the drip  and through interim bank borrowings 
seasonal cash requirements were provided through interim bank borrowings 
interim bank loans payable at year end were  approximately  higher than the same time the prior year 
this increase is due to the changes to the drip  as well as the decrease in cash flows from operations stemming primarily from the extreme weather differences between and management considers the current  line of credit with four banks adequate to finance expected short term borrowing requirements that may arise from operations during interest expense charged on interim bank loans will fluctuate subject to financial market conditions experienced during the year 
was the fourth consecutive year that interest coverage  the ratio of utility operating income plus federal and state income taxes to annualized interest expense on outstanding long term debt  exceeded times coverage 
the board of directors has approved a  construction budget for funds provided by operating activities  given normal weather patterns and related operating revenue billings and contributions from developers and others  are expected to finance approximately of this construction program

the remainder of the construction program is expected to be financed through interim bank loans 
page regulatory matters and inflation the subsidiary s last rate increase was effective march  that rate decision included a allowed return on common equity and a allowed return on rate base 
future economic and financial market conditions  coupled with governmental regulations and fiscal policy  plus other factors which are unpredictable and often beyond the control of the subsidiary  will influence when the subsidiary requests a revised schedule of rates from the dpuc 
construction expenditures mandated to comply with the amendments to the safe drinking water act sdwa will  when and if required  also affect water rates charged to customers 
the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve  and expand its service capability 
the cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher facility replacement costs which must be recovered from future cash flow 
the ability of the subsidiary to recover this increased investment in facilities is dependent upon future revenue increases which are subject to approval by the connecticut department of public utility control dpuc 
management does not presently plan to petition the dpuc for an increase in permanent rates in outlook for the company s profitability is primarily attributable to the sale and distribution of water  the amount of which is dependent on seasonal weather fluctuations  particularly during the summer months when water demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels 
through december   the company has expended approximately  in its effort to remediate the reynolds bridge well field rbwf contaminated with mtbe  a gasoline additive 
these costs have been deferred 
additional expenditures of approximately  related to this remediation effort are expected to be incurred in  and will also be deferred as management expects that these costs and future related costs will be recovered from the responsible parties  or through rates charged to customers
