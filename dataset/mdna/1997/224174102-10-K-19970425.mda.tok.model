item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is in the business of identifying  acquiring  owning and strategically managing controlling interests in other operating companies 
prior to march  the company accounted for its interests in stater  reading and citadel on the equity method 
during  certain transactions were effected which resulted in the transfer of the company s entire interest in stater and substantially all of its interest in citadel to reading and the consolidation  for accounting purposes  of craig and reading 
specifically  a in the first quarter of  stater exercised its right to convert the company s equity interest in stater into  shares of stater preferred stock  stated value per share  and the company sold its citadel common stock to reading  b in the second quarter of  the company increased its ownership in reading to greater than  and c in the fourth quarter of  the company contributed substantially all of its assets  including its stater preferred stock  citadel preferred stock and its interest in reading international to reading  in exchange for rei common stock and rei series b preferred stock 
at december   the company owned rei common stock and rei series b preferred stock representing approximately of the voting power of that company  and warrants to purchase  shares of citadel common stock at per share  which warrants were subsequently exercised by the company 
on this same date  reading held  in addition to its historic and internally developed assets   shares of stater preferred stock  and  shares of citadel common stock 
as used in this item  the term the consolidated company is used to describe  for accounting purposes  the company reporting on a consolidated basis its ownership interest in reading for the year ended december  the company is not consolidated with reading for federal income tax purposes  does not have common financing with reading  does not guarantee the obligations of reading and the company maintains separate offices and  with the exception of messrs 
cotter and tompkins  separate officers and directors from reading 
messrs 
cotter and tompkins are separately compensated by the company and reading 
rei has elected to focus its theater development and related real estate development activities in three principal areas i the management and development of motion picture theaters in australia  ii the domestic management and development and acquisition of specialty motion pictures theaters which feature foreign and limited release art films similar to the angelika  and iii the management and development of motion picture theaters in puerto rico 
to provide rei with equity to execute its theater acquisition and development plans  the company  reading and citadel completed the reorganization and stock transactions described below 
the reorganization and stock transactions the reorganization of rei was effected in order to consolidate reading s operations under a holding company incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware 
the consolidated company believes that such a structure will facilitate the financing of rei  without subjecting such capital to the contingent liabilities of the reading company s historical railroad businesses  and permit rei to avail itself of a more established body of corporate law than that of pennsylvania the state in which reading company is incorporated 
pursuant to the stock transactions  rei received  of cash from citadel 
in return rei issued to citadel   in stated value  shares of rei s series a preferred stock and granted citadel certain contractual rights including the asset put option 
the asset put option grants citadel the right to require the company to acquire substantially all of citadel s assets and assume related liabilities in return for the issuance of common stock at any time through a date days after the company files its annual report on form k 
the number of shares to be issued will be determined by dividing the appraised value of the citadel assets or million  whichever amount is lower  by if citadel exercises the asset put option by october  and thereafter 
if the appraised value of the citadel assets is in excess of million  rei will issue common stock at fair market value for such excess up to a total of million in citadel assets 
in addition  rei agreed to exchange the citadel preferred stock  which was acquired from craig in the stock transactions  for citadel s series b preferred stock containing terms modified in certain respects from the terms of the citadel preferred stock 
rei received from craig the stater preferred stock with a stated value of million the citadel preferred stock with a stated value of million and craig s interest in reading international 
in return  rei issued to craig   shares of common stock and  shares  stated value of series b voting cumulative preferred stock the series b preferred stock 
certain financial reporting and tax considerations the reorganization and stock transactions have been accounted for as a purchase 
the book value of the assets transferred by craig to rei were as follows citadel preferred stock  stater bros 
preferred stock  ownership interest in reading international  gross book value of assets received  plus accrued and unpaid dividends the citadel preferred stock was redeemed by citadel in december the stock transactions are intended to qualify as an exchange under section a a exchange of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in a exchange  the party acquiring the assets in the stock transactions  rei retains the contributing parties tax basis in the acquired assets  with no taxable gain recognized as a result of the exchange 
the parties contributing assets in the stock transactions  craig and citadel obtain a basis in the assets received in the exchange equal to the basis in the assets which are contributed in the exchange the series a and series b preferred stock 
with the exception of the stater preferred stock  the book value of the assets received in the stock transactions approximated the tax basis in the assets received 
craig s adjusted tax basis for federal tax purposes in the stater preferred stock was approximately million 
the estimated federal tax liabilities associated with the assets transferred in the stock transactions was approximately million  primarily relating to the stater preferred stock 
at the time of the closing of the stock transactions  rei had a gross deferred federal tax asset of million and a tax asset valuation allowance the tava in the same amount 
upon receipt of the stater preferred stock  it was determined that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset which had previously been fully reserved  would be realized and rei reduced the tava by million which amount reflects the amount of federal tax loss carryforwards nols which were expected to be utilized net of million in alternative minimum tax amt 
the acquisition of the reading securities by craig has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values  after consideration of the recognition by rei of previously reserved deferred tax assets as of the date of the stock transactions 
the aggregate purchase price of the fiscal purchases of rei stock by the company amounted to approximately million  of which approximately million represented the carrying value of the assets contributed in the exchange  net of the federal tax liabilities amounting to approximately million 
accordingly  the purchase  for financial statement purposes  resulted in negative goodwill in the amount of approximately million  which goodwill was allocated to reduce the carrying value of previously reported intangible assets related to craig s reading stock purchases and to reduce the fair value of the beneficial leases and leasehold improvements purchased 
management believes that the federal deferred tax liability transferred to rei was offset by rei s nol carryforwards see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
however  the amount of nols carried on the books of rei has not been audited by the internal revenue service the irs  and there can be no assurance that the irs would agree with the company as to the amount of nol available to offset such gains 
use of the nols is subject to certain limitations  including those resulting from certain changes in the ownership of the company 
while the transfer restrictions which are applicable to reading s equity securities are intended to minimize the risk of such ownership changes  ownership changes unknown to the company may have occurred despite or in violation of such restrictions 
in addition  the code and related case law limit the ability to use nols to offset certain built in gains on contributed property 
although the consolidated company does not believe that such limitations on the use of its nols would apply to the disposition of the stater preferred stock  there can be no assurance that the irs would not take a different position 
also  if the irs were to determine that the principal purpose of the stock transactions was to make use of the nols and the consolidated company could not show otherwise  such use may not be available 
in such case  the financial position of the consolidated company could be materially adversely affected 
rei issued common stock and the convertible preferred stock in exchange for the assets received in the stock transactions 
the series a preferred stock issued to citadel has not been included as a component of shareholders equity since it includes provisions which permit a majority of the holders to request redemption at stated value plus accrued and unpaid dividends for a day period beginning october  and also provides for redemption at the option of the majority of the holders  if rei fails to pay four quarterly dividends or in event of a change in control 
in addition to issuing to citadel the series a preferred stock  rei also granted the asset put option  which under certain circumstances permits citadel to exchange substantially all of its assets for common stock 
for financial statement purposes no value was allocated to the asset put option due in part to the subjective nature of the assumptions utilized in option pricing models and the fact that stock option valuation models are intended to value options and the asset put option is not transferable 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the consolidated company had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately million which includes approximately million held by reading 
at december   craig had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
rei is majority owned by the company and  accordingly  is included in the consolidated financial statements of the company as of december  see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
however  craig and rei are separate public companies and each entity s capital resources and liquidity is legally independent of the other and any intercompany loans or receivables would require approval of each separate company s board of directors 
the stock transactions transferred the title of the above described assets from craig to rei  resulting in craig s assets being principally comprised of rei common and preferred stock 
accordingly  the future liquidity of craig will be principally dependent on reading s ability to pay dividends in accordance with the terms of the reading preferred stock issued in the stock transaction  amounting to approximately million annually 
in addition to such dividends  craig receives from stater quarterly consulting payments amounting to million annually 
stater has the right to terminate the consulting agreement prior to its expiration in march  if stater were to repurchase the stater preferred stock 
while no assurances can be given  rei has been advised that stater is considering exercising its rights to repurchase the stater preferred stock 
reading australia s business plan provides for the development of country cinemas and entertainment centers see item i  business 
the country cinemas are smaller and more likely to be located in leased premises while the entertainment centers are generally free standing sites  many of which will include related retail developments which may be developed or sold as the theaters are developed 
it is intended that the entertainment centers be constructed on land owned by reading australia and  accordingly  such centers are capital intensive at this stage of development 
reading australia has signed three purchase agreements and a development agreement to acquire sites which will require the payment of approximately million 
if all of these projects are developed  reading australia estimates the total development cost of these four entertainment centers will aggregate in excess of million  over the next two to three years 
to provide reading australia with funding needed to complete its theater and entertainment center development plans without requiring rei to guarantee the indebtedness of reading australia and as a means of minimizing exposure to fluctuations in the value of the australian dollar and demonstrating the commitment to the australian market  reading contributed its stater preferred stock to reading australia 
it is anticipated that reading australia will pledge the stater preferred stock as collateral for australian dollar borrowings and reading australia has had preliminary discussions in furtherance thereof 
in addition  while no assurance can be given  rei has been advised that stater is considering exercising its right to repurchase the stater preferred stock and that such repurchase may occur as early as prior to the end of stater s fiscal year  september  if such repurchase were to occur  the repurchase would be at stated value  million 
however  there can be no assurance that such repurchase can or will be effected 
rei s contribution of the stater preferred stock to reading australia resulted in a taxable gain to reading for federal tax purposes of approximately million and an amt liability of million 
cine vista opened a new six plex on march  and will close four of six screens at another location in april in order to initiate construction of a new eight plex at the same location  which construction is anticipated to be completed in mid reading anticipates that it will invest approximately million in and in furtherance of these two projects 
cine vista is also negotiating provisions of an agreement to expand one facility and to open new theaters at two new sites which  collectively could result in the addition of up to new screens 
the timing of the additions is not predictable nor is the company assured of concluding these proposed developments 
the capital cost of these new additions is estimated to total approximately million 
cine vista may use funds available under its line of credit see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein to fund its theater development activities 
in  reading announced the signing of a lease for the first new theater based upon the angelika concept to be located in houston  texas 
reading is actively seeking sites to develop angelika type theaters throughout the united states and will consider acquiring leasehold or ownership interests in conjunction with such developments 
the cash cost of such developments can range from approximately million for a turnkey leased facility to over million for an owned site 
if the consolidated company is successful in its efforts to develop all of the projects which it is presently considering  its capital requirements over the next three years will exceed its existing cash balances  the value of the stater preferred stock or the proceeds thereof and existing borrowing arrangements 
however  the company believes that additional funding could be realized through  among other things  bank borrowings  sale and lease back transactions and the issuance sale of additional equity either of craig  rei  reading australia or at the project level 
prior to reading s quasi reorganization  reading had extensive railroad and related operations 
such operations may have contributed to environmental contamination of properties now owned by reading  previously sold by reading  or to which reading  prior to its reorganization  sent waste 
the ultimate extent of liabilities  if any  with respect to such matters  as well as the timing of cash disbursements  if any  cannot be determined 
however  management is of the opinion  based on the information currently known  that while the ultimate liability resulting from such matters could have a material effect upon the results of operations in a given year  they will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial position or liquidity
