item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in connection with the company s consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
effective december   the company changed its fiscal year end from march to december overview premiere is a network based computer telephony company specializing in the integration of information and telecommunications services 
the company delivers its services through its advanced computer telephony platform  which is accessible from  and provides access to  a variety of devices including the telephone  fax machine  pager and computer 
the platform is modular and scalable  with an open systems design which allows the company to quickly customize its services to meet the needs of its subscribers and business partners and to easily expand system capacity 
premiere s revenues consist of i subscriber services from information and telecommunications services  ii license fees from use of its computer telephony platform by customers of companies that have licensing relationships with premiere  and  to a lesser extent  iii other revenues  primarily long distance charges from hospitality services 
subscriber services revenues from information and telecommunications services  including premiere worldlink  afcom and co branded services  are based primarily on a per minute charge 
license fees are contracted on a long term basis and are generally based on a per minute charge and  in certain circumstances  a per usage charge 
other revenue charges are based on long distance rates established by the company depending upon the originating location of the call  and other various methods 
cost of services consists primarily of transmission costs 
licensees generally arrange for  and directly bear the cost of  transmission 
consequently  while the per minute fees for licensee platform usage are lower than those for the subscriber services  the gross margin from license arrangements is considerably higher than for subscriber services 
selling and marketing expenses include commissions to co branded partners  strategic partners  financial institutions that promote the company s afcom services and businesses participating in the hospitality program  the cost of print advertisements  direct sales force salaries and commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  bad debt expense and other operating costs related to the selling and marketing functions 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits except for selling and marketing salaries  rent and facility expense  accounting and audit fees  legal fees  property taxes and other administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of computer and network operations equipment and amortization of intangible assets 
the company provides for depreciation using the straight line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from five to ten years  with the exception of leasehold improvements which are depreciated on a straight line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the assets 
amortization of intangible assets includes deferred software development costs and the worldcom strategic alliance contract intangible  which are amortized over five years and years  respectively 
premiere electronically bills most subscriber services revenue directly to the subscriber s credit card or bank account using the ebis 
the company bills subscribers at least monthly and in certain instances more frequently if a particular subscriber exceeds pre set spending limits 
because substantially all of the company s subscriber services are billed electronically through the ebis  the company believes it has shortened the collection cycle compared to a traditional day non electronic billing arrangement 
license fees are generally billed and invoiced on a day basis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from the estimates 
the company periodically reviews the values assigned to long lived assets  such as property and equipment and software costs  to determine if any impairments are other than temporary 
management believes that the long lived assets in the accompanying balance sheets are appropriately valued 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship of certain statements of operations items to total revenues 
nine months ended year ended december  december  december  december  unaudited revenues subscriber services license fees other revenues total revenues cost of services gross margin operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization charge for purchased research and development accrued litigation costs total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest income interest expense other  net total other income expense net income loss before income taxes and extraordinary loss provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss before extraordinary loss extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt  net of tax effect of  net income loss year ended december  data was derived from the nine months ended december  data and the unaudited interim data for the three months ended march  the data is presented for comparative purposes and additional analysis 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  subscriber services revenues increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   due primarily to increased revenues from premiere worldlink subscriber services 
revenues from premiere worldlink subscriber services increased principally as a result of response to the company s print advertising campaign  which was substantially expanded starting in january  as well as the company s entering into additional co branded relationships 
revenues from afcom subscriber services decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   primarily due to certain branches of the military modifying their payroll practices to require direct deposit upon entering active duty 
this requirement has resulted in a reduction in the level of banking activity at certain military financial institutions with which the company has marketing arrangements 
the company has revised its afcom marketing strategy to attempt to address this situation 
license fees increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   due to both the establishment of additional licensing relationships and increased revenues from existing licensees 
other revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to non recurring system design and development revenues

this is a one time charge for the estimated legal fees and other costs that the company expected to incur to resolve the patent infringement suit filed by audiofax 
on february   the company entered into a long term  non exclusive license agreement with audiofax settling the litigation 
the one time charge was adequate to cover the actual costs of litigation and the cost of the license agreement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s earnings

the company had an unused net operating loss carry forward at december  of million

liquidity and capital resources the company s operating activities provided cash of  in the nine months ended december   provided cash of  in the year ended december   million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended december  and the year ended december   reflects the company s attainment of a level of operating revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs due to increased subscribers to the company s afcom and premiere worldlink services and increased revenues from license fees 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december   as compared to earlier periods  reflects the acceleration of the growth of the company s subscriber base during that period and the relatively greater contribution from license fees with their associated higher gross margin

see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has financed its cash requirements through a combination of equity and debt financing and  beginning in the nine months ended december   through cash flows from operating activities 
in may  the company borrowed million the first sirrom note from sirrom capital corporation sirrom  an independent lender unaffiliated with the company  which was used to fund the company s operations and for capital expenditures 
in december  the company borrowed an additional million from sirrom the second sirrom note the first sirrom note and second sirrom note are referred to as the notes 
in connection with entering into the notes  the company granted sirrom warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at per share  the terms of which do not require the cancellation or exercise of the warrants upon repayment of the notes 
the company used million of the net proceeds of its initial public offering to retire the notes in march in january  the company issued cumulative series a preferred stock to nationsbanc capital corporation nationsbanc  from which it realized net proceeds of million 
in connection with the issuance of the company s series a preferred stock  all of the company s outstanding preferred stock and debentures were converted into common stock 
a portion of the net proceeds of the second sirrom note and the issuance of the series a preferred stock was used to fund operations 
the company invested the remainder of the proceeds of the second sirrom note and the series a preferred stock  amounting to million  in short term interest bearing securities 
on january   the company exercised its right to redeem the series a preferred stock from nationsbanc

the company s principal commitments consist of an obligation under a capital lease for switching equipment  which amounted to  at december  and  at december   and the line of credit  which had a balance of million as of march  the company believes that its current cash balances  other working capital and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements for at least the next months and for the currently foreseeable future 
forward looking statements the company may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements  including statements contained in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission the commission and its reports to shareholders 
statements made in this annual report  other than those concerning historical information  should be considered forward looking and subject to various risks and uncertainties 
such forward looking statements are made based on management s belief as well as assumptions made by  and information currently available to  management pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements due to  among other things factors affecting operating results  seasonality  potential fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
special factors that may cause the company s future operating results to vary include the unique nature of strategic relationships into which the company may enter in the future  changes in operating expenses resulting from such strategic relationships and other factors  the continued acceptance of the company s licensing program  the financial performance of the company s licensees  the timing of new service announcements  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s services  potential acquisitions  changes in legislation and regulation that may affect the competitive environment for the company s communications services and general economic and seasonal factors 
in the future  revenues from the company s strategic relationships may become an increasingly significant portion of the company s total revenues 
due to the unique nature of each strategic relationship  these relationships may change the company s mix of expenses relative to revenues 
quarterly revenues are difficult to forecast because the market for the company s information and telecommunications services is rapidly evolving 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenues 
if revenue levels are below expectations  the company may be unable or unwilling to reduce expenses proportionately and operating results would likely be adversely affected 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the market price of the company s common stock will likely be adversely affected 
intense competition 
the information and telecommunications services industries are intensely competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
the company expects competition to increase in the future 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and substantially greater financial  personnel  marketing  engineering  technical and other resources than the company 
such competition could materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
the company attempts to differentiate itself from its competitors by offering an integrated suite of information and telecommunications services 
other providers currently offer each of the individual services and certain combinations of the services offered by the company 
the company s worldwide long distance services and features such as conference calling compete with services provided by companies such as at t  mci and sprint  as well as smaller interexchange long distance providers 
the company s voice mail services compete with voice mail services provided by certain rbocs as well as by independent voice mail vendors such as octel 
the company s enhanced travel services  concierge services  news services and electronic mail services are competing with services provided by america online  prodigy and numerous internet service providers 
when implemented  the company s orchestrate sm product will compete with companies such as octel  microsoft  novell  inc and lucent technologies inc lucent 
the company s call center technology will compete with companies such as at t  mci and lucent 
the company expects that other parties will develop and implement information and telecommunications service platforms similar to its platform  thereby increasing competition for the company s services 
in addition  on february   the president signed into law the act that will allow local exchange carriers  including the rbocs  to provide inter lata long distance telephone service  which will likely significantly increase competition for long distance services 
the new legislation also grants the fcc the authority to deregulate other aspects of the telecommunications industry  which in the future may  if authorized by the fcc  facilitate the offering of an integrated suite of information and telecommunications services by regulated entities  including the rbocs  in competition with the company 
such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
telecommunication companies compete for consumers based on price  with major long distance carriers conducting extensive advertising campaigns to capture market share 
there can be no assurance that a decrease in the rates charged for communications services by the major long distance carriers or other competitors  whether caused by general competitive pressures or the entry of the rbocs and other local exchange carriers into the long distance market  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
the company expects that the information and telecommunications services markets will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies  possibly including alternative technologies that are more sophisticated and cost effective than the company s technology 
the company does not have the contractual right to prevent its subscribers from changing to a competing network  and the company s subscribers may generally terminate their service with the company at will 
ability to manage growth  acquisition risks 
the company has experienced substantial growth in recent years 
this growth has placed significant demands on all aspects of the company s business  including its administrative  technical and financial personnel and systems 
additional expansion by the company may further strain the company s management  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of the company s operations 
the company s future operating results will substantially depend on the ability of its officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve its technical  administrative  financial control and reporting systems 
if the company is unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions  then the quality of the company s services  its ability to retain key personnel and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
at certain stages of growth in network usage  the company is required to add capacity to its computer telephony platform and its digital central office switch  thus requiring the company continuously to attempt to predict growth in its network usage and add capacity to its switch accordingly 
difficulties in managing continued growth  including difficulties in predicting the growth in network usage  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has grown  and intends to grow  in substantial part through acquisitions of complementary services  products  technologies or businesses 
the company acquired substantially all of the assets and business operations of telet in september there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully integrate telet s products  technologies  operations  personnel or business  or that once integrated telet s operations will achieve comparable levels of revenue  profitability or productivity as the company s operations existing at the time of the acquisition or otherwise perform as expected 
future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the write off of software development costs and the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
future acquisitions also involve numerous additional risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  entering markets in which the company has little or no direct prior experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
the company is unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition will be completed 
technological change  dependence on new services 
the computer telephony market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
the company s future success will depend in significant part on its ability to anticipate industry standards  continue to apply advances in technologies  enhance its current services  develop and introduce new services on a timely basis  enhance its software and its computer telephony platform and successfully compete with products and services based on evolving or new technology 
the company expects new products and services  and enhancements to existing products and services  to be developed and introduced which will compete with the services offered by the company 
among the new and evolving technologies that the company expects to compete for the services offered by the company are notebook computers equipped with sound cards  fax modems and cellular modems  portable internet appliances which would allow connection to the internet over wireless networks and personal digital assistants with enhanced communications features 
the company is also aware that products currently exist which allow text to voice e mail conversion and provide meet me services  and that several communications companies are developing or have developed services that would compete with the company s proposed follow me service by allowing users to have a single telephone number for all of their communications devices 
the company currently intends to introduce and market new and enhanced services in  including orchestrate sm and network based call center technology 
development of these services will require the implementation of new technologies and the integration of these technologies into the company s platform 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing service enhancements or new services that respond to these or other technological changes or evolving industry standards  that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of its services  or that its new services and the enhancements thereto  will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
delays in the introduction of new services  the inability of the company to develop such new services or the failure of such services to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
uncertainty of strategic relationships 
a principal element of the company s strategy is the creation and maintenance of strategic relationships that will enable the company to offer its services to a larger customer base than the company could otherwise reach through its direct marketing efforts 
the company has experienced growth in its existing strategic relationships during  and has entered into or initiated new strategic relationships with several companies  including worldcom  compuserve interactive united kingdom  mobilecomm and pagenet 
although the company intends to continue to expand its direct marketing channels  the company believes that strategic partner relationships may offer a potentially more effective and efficient marketing channel 
consequently  the company s success depends in part on the ultimate success of these relationships and on the ability of these strategic partners to effectively market the company s services 
failure of one or more of the company s strategic partners to successfully develop and sustain a market for the company s services  or the termination of one or more of the company s relationships with a strategic partner  could have a material adverse effect on the company s overall performance due to the possibility of more costly direct marketing expenditures by the company and other factors 
in november the company entered into a strategic alliance agreement with worldcom  the fourth largest long distance carrier in the united states  in which worldcom is required  among other things  to provide the company with the right of first opportunity to provide enhanced computer telephony services for a period of at least years 
in connection with this agreement  the company issued to worldcom  shares of common stock valued at approximately million based on an independent appraisal and paid worldcom million in cash 
the company recorded the value of this agreement as an intangible asset 
while the company believes that the intangible asset will be recovered over the life of the agreement  this recoverability is dependent upon the success of the strategic relationship 
the company will continually evaluate the realizability of the intangible asset recorded 
although the company views its strategic relationships as a key factor in its overall business strategy and in the development and commercialization of its services  there can be no assurance that its strategic partners view their relationships with the company as significant for their own businesses or that they will not reassess their commitment to the company in the future 
the company s arrangements with its strategic partners do not always establish minimum performance requirements for the company s strategic partners  but instead rely on the voluntary efforts of these partners in pursuing joint goals 
certain of these arrangements prevent the company from entering into strategic relationships with other companies in the same industry as the company s strategic partners  either for specified periods of time or while the arrangements remain in force 
in addition  even when the company is without contractual restriction  it may be restrained by business considerations from pursuing alternative arrangements 
the ability of the company s strategic partners to incorporate the company s services into successful commercial ventures will require the company  among other things  to continue to successfully enhance its existing services and develop new services 
the company s inability to meet the requirements of its strategic partners or to comply with the terms of its strategic partner arrangements could result in its strategic partners failing to market the company s services  seeking alternative providers of communication and information services or canceling their contracts with the company  any of which could have a material adverse impact on the company 
dependence on licensing and strategic relationships 
the company has licensing relationships with companies that have chosen to outsource part or all of their communications card services to premiere 
license fees accounted for approximately of premiere s revenues 
one licensee  cnc  accounted for approximately of premiere s license fees and approximately of the company s total revenues 
on august   cnc was placed into bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
cnc owed the company approximately  as of december  however  cnc s transmission provider  wiltel  is also obligated to pay this amount to the company 
in addition  worldcom accounted for approximately of premiere s license fees and approximately of premiere s total revenues 
the company believes that through a combination of new licensing agreements  the strategic alliance agreement with worldcom and increased revenues from existing licensees  the company has replaced all of the anticipated cnc revenue 
the company intends to increase its number of licensees and its licensee transaction volume in the future 
the company s success depends in part upon the ultimate success or failure of its licensees 
the telecommunications industry is intensely competitive and rapidly consolidating 
the majority of companies that have chosen to outsource communications card services to premiere are small or medium sized telecommunications companies that may be unable to withstand the intense competition in the telecommunications industry 
during the past months  one licensee  in addition to cnc  ceased doing business with the company primarily due to financial difficulties 
licensees that ceased doing business with premiere due to financial difficulties contributed in the aggregate approximately million of premiere s revenues 
although the company was able to add new licensees in  there can be no assurance that the failure of one or more of the company s licensees to develop and sustain a market for the company s services  or termination of one or more of the company s licensing relationships  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
potential adverse impact of pending litigation 
the company has several litigation matters pending  which the company is defending vigorously 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the judicial system  the company is unable to predict the outcome of such litigation matters 
if the outcome of one or more of such matters is adverse to the company  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
dependence on key management and personnel 
the company s success is largely dependent upon its executive officers and other key personnel  the loss of one or more of whom could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that its continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of boland t 
jones  chairman and president  d 
gregory smith  executive vice president  gregg s 
freishtat  senior vice president  and leonard a 
denittis  vice president of engineering and operations  and certain other key executives 
the loss of services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect upon the company 
messrs 
jones  smith and denittis have entered into employment agreements with the company which expire in december  and the company maintains key man life insurance on each of these persons in the amounts of million  million and million  respectively 
the company also believes that to be successful it must hire and retain highly qualified engineering and product development personnel 
competition in the recruitment of highly qualified personnel in the information and telecommunications services industry is intense 
the inability of the company to locate  hire and retain such personnel may have a material adverse effect on the company 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to retain its key employees or that it will be able to attract qualified personnel in the future 
dependence on switching facilities and computer telephony platforms  damage  failure and downtime 
the company currently maintains switching facilities and computer telephony platforms in atlanta  georgia and dallas  texas  and a pop site in london  england 
the company s network service operations are dependent upon its ability to protect the equipment and data at its switching facilities against damage that may be caused by fire  power loss  technical failures  unauthorized intrusion  natural disasters  sabotage and other similar events 
the company has taken precautions to protect itself and its subscribers from events that could interrupt delivery of the company s services 
these precautions include physical security systems  uninterruptible power supplies  on site power generators designed to be sufficient to continue operation of the company s network in the event of a power outage for approximately four days  upgraded backup hardware and chemical fire protection systems 
the company s network is further designed such that the data on each network server is duplicated on a separate network server 
notwithstanding such precautions  there can be no assurance that a fire  act of sabotage  technical failure  natural disaster or a similar event would not cause the failure of a network server and its backup server  other portions of the company s network or one of the facilities as a whole  thereby resulting in an outage of the company s services 
such an outage could have a material adverse effect on the company 
while the company has not experienced any downtime of its network due to natural disasters or similar events  on occasion the company has experienced downtime due to various technical failures 
when such failures have occurred  the company has worked to remedy the failure as soon as possible 
the company believes that these technical failures have been infrequent 
although the company maintains business interruption insurance providing for aggregate coverage of approximately million per policy year  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its business interruption insurance  that such insurance would continue to be available at reasonable prices  that such insurance would cover all such losses or that such insurance would be sufficient to compensate the company for losses it experiences due to the company s inability to provide services to its subscribers 
limited protection of proprietary technology  risks of infringement 
the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws and contractual confidentiality provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection of the company s proprietary rights 
the company has one patent application pending and trademark or copyright registrations pending 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s software or services or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
although the company is not aware of any current or previous infringement on its proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states 
the company is aware of other companies that use the terms worldlink or premiere in describing their products and services  including telecommunications products and services 
certain of those companies hold registered trademarks which incorporate the names worldlink or premiere 
the company has received correspondence from a provider of prepaid calling cards which claims that the company s use of the term premiere worldlink infringes upon its trademark rights 
in addition  the company has received correspondence from a major bank  which is among the holders of registered trademarks incorporating the term worldlink  inquiring as to the nature of the company s use of the term worldlink as a part of its mark premiere worldlink 
based on  among other things  the types of businesses in which the other companies are engaged and the low likelihood of confusion  the company believes these claims to be without merit 
no assurance can be given that actions or claims alleging trademark  patent or copyright infringement will not be brought against the company with respect to current or future products or services  or that  if such actions are brought  the company will ultimately prevail 
any such claiming parties may have significantly greater resources than the company to pursue litigation of such claims 
any such claims  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause delays in introducing new or improved services  require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or cause the company to discontinue use of the challenged tradename  service mark or technology at potential significant expense to the company associated with the marketing of a new name or the development or purchase of replacement technology  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
on june   audiofax filed a complaint against the company and pci in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia 
in the complaint  audiofax alleged that the company manufactures  uses  sells and or distributes certain enhanced facsimile products which infringe three united states patents and one canadian patent allegedly held by audiofax 
in the third quarter of the company took a one time charge for the estimated legal fees and other costs that the company expected to incur to resolve this matter 
on february   the company entered into a long term  non exclusive license agreement with audiofax settling the litigation 
dependence upon software 
the software developed and utilized by the company in providing its services may contain undetected errors 
although the company engages in extensive testing of its software prior to introducing the software onto its network  there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in software after commencement of use of such software 
any such error may result in partial or total failure of the company s network  additional and unexpected expenses to fund further product development or to add programming personnel to complete a development project  and loss of revenue because of the inability of subscribers to use premiere s network or the cancellation by subscribers of their service with premiere  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company maintains technology errors and omissions insurance coverage of million per policy aggregate 
dependence upon telecommunication providers  no guaranteed supply 
the company does not own a transmission network and  accordingly  depends on wiltel  corporate telemanagement  inc ctg  cherry communications  incorporated cherry  sprint and other facilities based and non facilities based carriers for transmission of its subscribers long distance calls 
for the year ended december   wiltel  ctg  cherry and mci were responsible for carrying traffic representing approximately   and  respectively  of the minutes of long distance transmissions billed to the company 
further  the company is dependent upon local exchange carriers for call origination and termination 
in october  a carrier utilized by the company to originate calls experienced a regional network outage due to hurricane opal 
the company s losses due to this outage were approximately  all of which  less a  deductible  was reimbursed by the company s insurance carrier 
in september  a provider utilized by the company to originate calls experienced a regional network outage due to a technical malfunction caused by a third party vendor performing software maintenance on the provider s network 
the company estimated its losses at approximately  due to this outage 
this loss was not covered by the company s insurance 
although the company s originating providers are generally able to reroute the company s inbound calls within several hours of an outage  rerouting was not possible in these instances due to the widespread nature of the outages 
if there is an outage affecting one of the company s terminating carriers  the company s platform automatically switches calls to another terminating carrier if capacity is available 
the company has not experienced significant losses in the past because of interruptions of service at terminating carriers  but no assurance can be made in this regard with respect to the future 
the company s ability to maintain and expand its business depends  in part  on its ability to continue to obtain telecommunication services on favorable terms from long distance carriers and the cooperation of both interexchange and local exchange carriers in originating and terminating service for its subscribers in a timely manner 
a partial or total failure of the company s ability to receive or terminate calls would result in a loss of revenues by the company and could lead to a loss of subscribers  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
regulation 
various regulatory factors may have an impact on the company s ability to compete and on its financial performance 
the company is subject to regulation by the fcc and by various state public service and public utility commissions 
federal and state regulations and regulatory trends have had  and may have in the future  both positive and negative effects on the company and on the information and telecommunications service industries as a whole 
fcc policy currently requires interexchange carriers to provide resale of the use of their transmission facilities 
the fcc also requires local exchange carriers to provide all interexchange carriers with equal access to the origination and termination of calls 
if either or both of these requirements were removed  the company could be adversely affected 
these carriers may experience disruptions in service due to factors outside the company s control  which may cause the company to lose the ability to complete its subscribers long distance calls 
the company has made all filings with the fcc necessary to allow the company to provide interstate and international long distance service 
in order to provide intrastate long distance service  the company is generally required to obtain certification to provide telecommunications services from the public service or public utility commissions of each state  or to register or be found exempt from registration by such commissions 
premiere has made the filings and taken the actions it believes are necessary to become certified or tariffed to provide intrastate card services to customers throughout the united states  except in two states  alaska and hawaii  which have historically had restrictions making the cost prohibitive in light of the immaterial amount of intrastate traffic the company handles in those states 
this  however  has recently changed and the company anticipates authorization to occur in to date  the company has not been denied any licenses or tariffs 
the company has received authorization to provide intrastate card services in states  and its applications to provide intrastate card services are pending in states 
with the exception of one state  new mexico  in which the company s application to provide service is pending  the company has received authorization to provide service in each state where the company provides such service 
the company s platform does not prevent subscribers from using the platform to make intrastate long distance calls in any state  including states in which the company has not received approval to provide intrastate long distance services 
there can be no assurance that the company s provision of intrastate card services and service in states where it is not certified or tariffed to provide such services will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
on february   the president signed into law the act which will allow local exchange carriers  including the rbocs  to provide inter lata long distance telephone service and which also grants the fcc authority to deregulate other aspects of the telecommunications industry 
the new legislation may result in increased competition to the company from others  including the rbocs and increased transmission costs in the future 
in addition  the company may be subject to additional regulatory requirements and fees as a result of changes made by the act 
in conducting various aspects of its business  the company is subject to various laws and regulations relating to commercial transactions generally  such as the uniform commercial code and is also subject to the electronic funds transfer rules embodied in regulation e promulgated by the board of governors of the federal reserve 
given the expansion of the electronic commerce market  the federal reserve might revise regulation e or adopt new rules for electronic funds transfer affecting users other than consumers 
congress has held hearings on whether to regulate providers of services and transactions in the electronic commerce market  and it is possible that congress or individual states could enact laws regulating the electronic commerce market 
if enacted  such laws  rules and regulations could be imposed on the company s business and industry and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
risks associated with international expansion 
a key component of the company s strategy is its planned expansion into international markets 
in  the company opened a pop site in london  england and the company intends to pursue long term strategic relationships with european partners 
the company also intends to establish telnodes and network managers in new zealand  canada and potentially other countries in if international revenues are not adequate to offset the expense of establishing and maintaining these international operations  the company s business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
to date  the company has only limited experience in marketing and distributing its services internationally 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully establish the proposed international telnodes and network managers  or to market  sell and deliver its services in these markets 
in addition to the uncertainty as to the company s ability to expand its international presence  there are certain difficulties and risks inherent in doing business on an international level  such as burdensome regulatory requirements and unexpected changes in these requirements  export restrictions  export controls relating to technology  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world and potentially adverse tax consequences  which could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the company s international operations 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international operations and  consequently  on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
risk of loss from returned transactions  fraud  bad debt  theft of services 
the company utilizes two principal financial payment clearance systems the federal reserve s automated clearing house ach for electronic fund transfers and the national credit card systems for electronic credit card settlement 
in its use of these established payment clearance systems  the company generally bears credit risks similar to that normally assumed by other users of these systems arising from returned transactions caused by insufficient funds  stop payment orders  closed accounts  frozen accounts  unauthorized use  disputes  theft or fraud 
from time to time  persons have gained unauthorized access to the company s network and obtained services without rendering payment to the company by unlawfully utilizing the access numbers and pins of authorized users 
no assurance can be given that future losses due to unauthorized use of access numbers and pins will not be material 
the company attempts to manage these risks through its internal controls and proprietary billing system 
the company s computer telephony platform prohibits a single access number and pin from establishing multiple simultaneous connections to the platform  and the company establishes preset spending limits for each subscriber 
past experience in estimating and establishing reserves  and the company s historical losses are not necessarily accurate indications of the company s future losses or the adequacy of the reserves established by the company in the future 
although the company believes that its risk management and bad debt reserve practices are adequate  there can be no assurance that the company s risk management practices or reserves will be sufficient to protect the company from unauthorized or returned transactions or thefts of services which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
volatility of stock price 
there may be significant volatility in the market price for the common stock 
the company believes factors such as actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in financial results  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts and announcements of material events by the company  its major strategic partners or licensees or its competitors may cause the market price for the common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic conditions  may have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and technology related stocks in particular  have experienced price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
the company cautions that such factors are not exclusive 
the company does not undertake to update any forward looking statement that may be made from time to time by  or on behalf of  the company
