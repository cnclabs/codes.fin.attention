the results of operations for the year ended december  include the results of operations of medtox for the period january  through december  since inception  the company has financed its working capital requirements primarily from the sale of equity securities 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to the increase in revenues from products and services 
these revenues totaled  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the prior year 
laboratory service revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was due to the revenues contributed by the medtox customer base 
the revenues generated by medtox for the period february  through december  were  providing for pro forma comparable laboratory service revenues for the year ended december  of  as compared to the  of revenues realized from the sales of laboratory services for the year ended december  included in product sales are the sales generated from substance abuse testing products  which incorporates the ez screen and verdict on site test kits and other ancillary products for the detection of abused substances 
sales from these products were  for the year ended december  compared to  recorded for the year ended december  this increase of was primarily the result of sales of the ez screen profile test kits which were introduced in may of  as well as increased sales of the verdict test kits 
product sales also include sales of diagnostic products for the agricultural market 
sales of these products were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december sales of other products  including contract manufacturing services were  for the year ended december  sales of these products and services were  for the year ended december  the decrease of was primarily the result of the company s decision not to market these products 
accordingly  the company closed down the operations of its farm facility during while the closure will decrease the amount of revenues generated from these sales  the elimination of the costs of the farm facility are expected to improve the overall gross margin 
the company does  however  intend to pursue additional contract manufacturing contracts 
revenues generated from the shipments of products to the us department of defense were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  revenues from royalties and fees during the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower royalties from american medical laboratories  inc aml  as aml lost accounts that required payment of royalties to the company 
revenues from interest and other income for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the  in included the recovery of debts owed by a customer of laboratory services which had been written off  as well as a payment made to the company by the landlord of the facility in new jersey for renewing the lease for that facility 
during  there was no such payment or recovery of such debts 
the gross margin from the revenues generated from the laboratory services was for the year ended december  an increase compared to  when the gross margin was 
the improvement in the gross margin was primarily due to the operations of medtox and the consolidation of the laboratory operations of pdla into the laboratory operations of medtox 
gross margins from the sales of both manufactured products and products purchased for resale for the year ended december  were compared to of sales of these products during the year ended december  this increase in gross margin from product sales is primarily the result of the increased sales of contract manufacturing services  sales of the ez screen profile test kits  as well as sales of the agricultural products sold through diagnostix 
selling  general and administration expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  of the  increase  medtox related expenses totaled  net of medtox  there was an increase of  compared to the same period in this increase is primarily due to  of amortization expense related to goodwill resulting from the medtox acquisition 
in addition  the company has expensed in excess of  for legal fees during the year ended december  these legal fees are primarily for expenses relating to the company s inability to issue shares to certain of the series a preferred shareholders 
research and development expenses incurred during the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the same period in this increase of  was primarily the result of  of research and development expenses from medtox as well as increases in personnel costs 
for the year ended december   editek incurred interest expense of  compared to interest expense of  incurred during the year ended december  this increase was the result of the funds borrowed by the company to complete the financing for the acquisition of medtox 
in connection with the acquisition of medtox  the company determined that it would be beneficial to consolidate the laboratory operations of pdla into the laboratory operations at medtox as well as to down size certain administrative positions at both pdla and medtox in order to eliminate duplicative functions 
the company also determined that to improve the operating results of the company  it would be necessary to sell the former operations of bioman  close its farm facility and reduce its work force at its burlington  north carolina location 
as a result of these restructuring steps  the company has taken charges of  during the year ended december  to cover certain costs of the restructurings  including  related to certain severance payments see note of the financial statements 
the company had no such charge during the year ended december  as previously reported  the company has undertaken a review of the value of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of medtox in the purpose of the review was to determine if the value of the goodwill  generated as a result of the price paid by the company for medtox  was in fact supported by the projected future benefit to the company as measured by generated cash flow 
given the highly competitive nature of the testing marketplace  the industry is undergoing  and medtox has begun to experience  a declining average selling price 
the company expects this trend to continue 
in addition  the company expects that alternative testing methods  including on site testing  are available or may become available in future years that may make the current forms of laboratory testing less competitive 
while the company expects to continue to develop and or evaluate new testing technologies  the current form of laboratory testing at medtox could not support the carrying value of the goodwill from the sale of that laboratory to the company 
utilizing an undiscounted cash flow analysis  the company determined that the carrying value of the remaining goodwill associated with the medtox acquisition exceeded the estimated cash flows 
accordingly  the company recorded a write off of  at december  the noncash write off of the goodwill will reduce the future amortization expense of the company by  per year 
at december   the company recorded a write off of  of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of pdla 
as a result of the above  the net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to the net loss of  for the year ended december  management believes the acquisition of medtox and the restructuring of the laboratory operations will significantly improve the operating results of the company although there can be no assurance of the success of the consolidation of the laboratory operations in reducing costs and improving efficiencies 
management expects net sales to grow through both the addition of new accounts as well as the introduction of new products as well as additional strategic acquisitions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for year ended december  increased to  compared to  for the prior year 
this increase is primarily fully attributable to the increase in revenues from sales of products and services for these revenues totaled  an increase of compared to  for the prior year 
laboratory service revenues for the year ended december  were  an increase compared to  for the prior year 
this increase was due primarily to the efforts of a full sales and marketing force for the laboratory services of pdla 
during the year ended december   the company realized sales of  from laboratory services that were transferred to american medical laboratories  inc aml in january and  as such  are not included in the sales for the year ended december  accordingly  the increase in laboratory service revenue excluding those sales transferred to aml was actually  product sales include the sales generated from substance abuse testing products  which incorporates the ez screen and verdict on site tests and other ancillary products for the detection of abused substances 
sales from these products were  down compared to  for the prior year 
the company believes this decrease was primarily due to increased competition 
this competition was caused by the introduction of several products by competitors which compete with the products of the company 
the decrease was also affected by the lack of a complete product line of the verdict products 
product sales also include sales of agricultural diagnostic products which are marketed through diagnostix  inc 
sales of these products were  for the year ended december   an increase of compared to sales of  for the prior year 
the acquisition of bioman products inc on june  brought  in sales revenues to the company for the year ended december  excluding these revenues  sales of agricultural diagnostic products were  for  a decrease of compared to the company believes this decrease is due to decreased testing by customers of the company 
sales of microbiological and associated product sales and contract manufacturing services were  for the year ended december   down compared to  for these products and services in this decrease was due to a reduced marketing effort 
in  the company completed research and development on certain tests developed for the us department of defense 
this enabled production to begin for the first time on products specifically manufactured for the us department of defense 
revenues from shipment of these products were  for the year ended december  revenues from royalties and fees during the year ended december  were  compared to  for this increase was primarily due to the royalties received from aml pursuant to the agreement the company has with aml 
revenues from interest and other income for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the overall gross margin from sales for the year ended december  was  compared to of sales for the year ended december  gross margins from the sales of both manufactured and products purchased for resale for the year ended december  were compared to of sales of these products for the year ended december  an increase in the number of samples being processed at pdla resulted in improved gross margins for laboratory services for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the gross margin was as compared to for the year ended december  since a large amount of the costs of providing laboratory services are fixed or near fixed costs  the margins from sales of laboratory services are volume dependent 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of was primarily a result of increased sales and marketing expenses associated with the sale of the substance abuse testing products and services marketed through pdla  the sales and marketing costs associated with former operations of bioman  as well as overall increases in the general expenditures resulting from the acquisition of pdla 
research and development expenses incurred during the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs and expenses  as well as increases in work being performed pursuant to the dod contract 
for the year ended december   the company incurred interest expense of  compared to interest expense of  incurred during the year ended december  the continued operating losses and negative cash flows in of the pdla operations resulted in an evaluation at year end of the pdla goodwill for possible impairment 
the company determined that the operations of pdla did not have long term future viability as a stand alone laboratory operation and would not be supported by the company on a stand alone basis 
the underlying factors contributing to the financial results for pdla include competitive pricing pressures in the marketplace and the inability of the company to generate sufficient pdla business volume that would result in positive cash flows and profitable operations as a stand alone laboratory operation 
the company performed an analysis of the pdla undiscounted cash flows and projected that pdla would have negative cash flows for the foreseeable future 
the company determined that the estimated shortfall of cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the remaining pdla goodwill  and as a result  recorded a write off of  at december  the noncash write off of goodwill will reduce the future amortization expense of the company by  per year 
as a result of the above  the net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to the net loss of  for the year ended december  material changes in financial condition at december   cash and cash equivalents were  compared to  as of december  at december   net accounts receivable were  this  increase compared to  at december  was primarily due to the medtox accounts receivable balance at december  inventories were  at december  compared to  at december  this increase of  or was primarily due to the inventory balance of medtox at december  prepaid expenses and other assets were  at december   as compared to  at december  this decrease of  was primarily the result of the january application of the  deposit the company had previously made towards the purchase price for the acquisition of medtox 
as of december   the company had a balance of accounts payable of  compared to a balance of  at december  the increase of  was net of an increase due to accounts payable of medtox and a decrease in past due expenses resulting from the company s improved financial condition 
accrued expenses were  at december   as compared to  at december  of the total increase of  the accrued expenses from medtox were  at december  as of december   the company had accrued  for the payment of certain restructuring costs associated with the consolidation of the laboratory of pdla with the laboratory operations of medtox as well as costs associated with certain actions taken by the company including a reduction in work force during the year ended december  in addition  medtox has accrued  for the payment of a lease obligation for a facility no longer used by medtox 
as a result  the company has a total balance accrued restructuring costs of  at december  at december   the company had no accrual for restructuring costs

at december   the company had a total balance of  for its loan payable to its institutional lender 
at december   the company had total loans payable of  liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the working capital requirements of the company have been funded by cash received from equity investments in the company 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  to finance the acquisition of medtox and provide working capital  the company raised  from the sale of shares of series a preferred stock and borrowed  the debt financing consists of two term loans totaling  and up to  in the form of a revolving line of credit based primarily on the receivables of the company the loan agreement 
the amount of credit available to the company varies with the accounts receivable and the inventory of the company 
the interest rates on the two term loans of  each are points above the prime rate and points above the prime rate 
the revolving line of credit carries an interest rate equal to points above the prime rate 
the company believes that the aforementioned capital will be sufficient to fund the company s planned operations through  although there can be no assurance that the available capital will be sufficient to fund the future operations of the company beyond as of december   the company had not achieved a positive cash flow from operations 
accordingly  the company relies on available credit arrangements  outside funding of research and development  and continued sales of its equity securities to fund operations until a positive cash flow can be achieved 
management believes that it has taken  and is prepared to continue to take  the actions required to yield a positive cash flow from operations in the future 
the company believes that the acquisition of medtox  the consolidation of the laboratory operations from pdla to medtox  and other synergies that will be realized from the acquisition of medtox will enable the company to generate positive cash flow 
the company continues to follow a plan which includes i continuing to aggressively monitor and control costs  ii increasing revenue from sales of the company s products  services  and research and development contracts  as well as iii pursuing synergistic acquisitions to increase the company s critical mass 
there can be no assurance that costs can be controlled  revenues can be increased  financing may be obtained  acquisitions successfully consummated  or that the company will be profitable
