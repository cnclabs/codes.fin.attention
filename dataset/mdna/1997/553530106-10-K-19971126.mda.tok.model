the company believes that revenue has increased  in part  as a result of the increase in the number of skus  however  the company is unable to quantify precisely the impact of such increase 
the company intends to continue to add new product categories and increase the number of products offered in existing product categories in its efforts to gain new customers and increase sales from existing customers 
during fiscal  the company added over  skus and expects to add approximately  skus during each of the next two fiscal years 
the company generally adds skus in response to the feedback it receives from its existing customers
