in january  ryder scott company petroleum engineers ryder scott  an internationally recognized petroleum engineering group retained by the company  has stated that in its opinion  after review  a reserve report commissioned by the company which estimated that the karakuduk field has estimated recoverable oil of million barrels which could be considered proved undeveloped  is reasonable 
however  neither the ryder scott opinion or the reserve report considered the potential adverse impact of marketability on price of any oil which might be produced due to the remote location of the field or potential political instability and  therefore  none of the reserves can presently be considered proven 
the production and marketing of the oil reserves will be subject to a number of political  economic and other risks

the company had working capital of approximately  at november  total current assets were  and total current liabilities were  for a working capital ratio of approximately to net cash and cash equivalents increased by  from november  to november   primarily due to funds received from the completion of a private placement of  shares of the company s common stock for gross proceeds of  in april  the company currently owns of the outstanding common stock of central asian petroleum guernsey limited cap g which has a interest in karakuduk munay  inc kkm  which holds of the right to develop the karakuduk field

the remaining cash balance of  for the purchase was to be paid in four quarterly equal payments of  between june  and march  the first payment of  was paid in june and an additional  was paid in september the agreement was subsequently revised so that the company paid  in december the company was to pay  on or before march  the company is currently negotiating to obtain an extension of the due date of the remaining payment 
in addition  the company has an option to purchase the remaining of the outstanding common stock of cap g for an additional  and  shares of the company s common stock at any time following completion of the initial purchase and prior to december  the company does not have any income producing properties and the karakuduk oil field is substantially undeveloped 
the karakuduk project will require significant development costs for which the financing is not complete 
there can be no assurance that the project will be adequately financed or that the field will be successfully developed 
the license requires minimum work plans of approximately million by august   of approximately million by august  and of approximately million by august  the agreement provides kkm with the right to defer the minimum work program under certain conditions 
as part of the minimum work plan requirement  the company has loaned cap g million to fund kkm s current operations 
kkm s budget  which has not been approved  would entail a minimum expenditure of million through august  subject to the receipt of additional financing by the company  this requirement will be funded by the company through loans by its subsidiary cap g to kkm 
the company has applied with overseas private investment corporation opic for four political risk coverages on the company s investment in the karakuduk field in western kazakstan 
the maximum insured amounts sought for each coverage range from to million 
the estimated yearly premium amounts for the current insured amounts for each coverage range up to  the estimated yearly standby premiums for each coverage range up to  the actual premium values may be higher or lower depending on the contract offered to the company by opic 
the investment committee of opic approved the company s karakuduk operations for political risk insurance coverage by opic on december  the company has received an executed letter of commitment on september   from opic binding issuance of political risk insurance for the karakuduk project

in november and december   the company borrowed  for interim financing pursuant to unsecured convertible promissory notes that bear interest at per annum  which is payable monthly  and that are due and payable on or before may  the promissory notes are convertible into the company s common stock at the lower of per share or of the market price of the common stock on the date of the conversion if the market price is less than per share on such date 
the proceeds from the first of such loans was received on november  the company used the funds from the loans primarily for the company s obligations to provide financing for the company s karakuduk project in kazakstan and to make a payment of  due in connection with the company s previous purchase of of the outstanding shares of cap g 
without additional financing  the company s present cash and other capital resources are not sufficient to fund the obligations of cap g to pay the karakuduk field development expenses incurred by kkm for the balance of  to make the balance of the payments to complete the purchase of of the cap g stock and to provide working capital for the company 
the company has raised capital to finance a portion of its obligations in connection with the acquisition of its interest in cap g and the development of the karakuduk field and to satisfy working capital needs in the short term 
the company plans to meet its additional capital needs through debt or equity offerings  encumbering properties  entering into arrangements whereby certain costs of development will be paid by others to earn an interest in the properties  or sale of a portion of the company s interests in the karakuduk field 
the present environment for financing the acquisition of oil and gas properties or the ongoing obligations of the oil and gas business is uncertain due  in part  to instability in oil and gas pricing in recent years 
the company s small size and the early stage of development of the karakuduk field may also increase the difficulty in raising needed financing 
there can be no assurance that debt or equity financing anticipated to be necessary to continue to fund the company s operations and obligations will be available to the company on economically acceptable terms  if at all 
if sufficient funds cannot be raised to meet the continuing obligations with respect to the karakuduk field development  the company s interest in such property may be lost 
also  if sufficient funds cannot be raised to provide additional working capital  it is likely that the company will not be able to continue operations 
the company has no other material commitments for cash outlay and capital expenditures other than for normal operations

for  there was a  or extraordinary per share loss on the extinguishment of long term debt which resulted in a net loss of  or per share for results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal the company s operations during fiscal resulted in a loss of  primarily due to a noncash write down of oil and gas properties of  for fiscal due to the noncash write down  the net loss for fiscal was  compared to a net loss of  during fiscal the noncash write down was primarily the result of the decreased value of estimated future net values of proved reserves due to lower gas prices during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the sale of proved reserves during revenue from oil and gas sales decreased  or from  in fiscal due to lower production  lower crude oil and natural gas prices and sale or abandonment of certain producing properties

the forward looking statements herein are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
such forward looking statements are based on assumptions that the company will have adequate financial resources to fund the development of the karakuduk field  that significant reserves of oil will be developed in the karakuduk field which can be readily and profitably marketed  and that there will be no material adverse change in the company s operations or business 
the foregoing assumptions are based on judgment with respect to  among other things  oil and natural gas reserve information available to the company  future economic  competitive and market conditions and future business decisions  all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the company s control 
accordingly  although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements are reasonable  any such assumption could prove to be inaccurate and therefore there can be no assurance that the results contemplated in forward looking statements will be realized 
there are a number of other risks presented by the company s business and operations which could cause the company s financial performance to vary markedly from prior results or results contemplated by the forward looking statements 
management decisions  including budgeting  are subjective in many respects and periodic revisions must be made to reflect actual conditions and business developments  the impact of which may cause the company to alter its capital investment and other expenditures  which may also adversely affect the company s results of operations 
in light of significant uncertainties inherent in forward looking information included in this annual report on form k  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the company s objectives or plans will be achieved
