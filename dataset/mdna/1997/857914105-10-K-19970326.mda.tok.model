item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loans  mortgage backed and debt and equity securities and the interest paid on its deposits and other borrowings 
the company s results of operations are also affected by its provision for loan losses  non interest income and non interest expense 
in addition  the company s results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies also may materially impact the company 
management strategy the company s goal is to enhance shareholder value by being the premier community bank in its market area 
management s objectives toward accomplishing this goal are to aggressively market its lending products while maintaining credit quality  seek low cost sources of funds  deliver excellent customer service through an efficient  low cost network and provide a fair return on investor s capital 
the company employs the following principal strategies to accomplish these objectives it seeks to originate or purchase with servicing rights one to four family residential mortgage loans  consumer loans  primarily secured by junior liens on residential real estate  and federal housing administration fha title insured home improvement loans  the company seeks to invest funds in excess of loan demand in mortgage backed securities  classified as available for sale  which have risks and yields similar to mortgages the company would have otherwise originated or purchased  it seeks to originate securitized commercial loans for equipment  inventory  working capital  real estate and other business purposes  it seeks to utilize its strong capital position  by borrowing funds to originate or purchase loans  or to invest in mortgage backed securities  which are classified as available for sale  and whose average life  considering expected prepayments  is consistent with five and ten year treasury instruments  it seeks to control its operating expenses by effectuating productivity savings from new systems and procedures  as well as through optimization of its retail delivery sites and systems  it seeks to offer superior service and competitive rates to maintain its core deposit base  it seeks to manage its capital through analysis of current alternatives for capital deployment  and it seeks to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk by purchasing and originating adjustable rate first mortgage loans arm  fixed rate first mortgage loans with terms to maturity of no more than fifteen years  floating rate commercial loans  and consumer loans  as well as by emphasizing retention and growth of core deposits and investing in mortgage backed securities  which it classifies as available for sale  and whose expected lives are comparable to five and ten year treasury instruments 
in conjunction with its strategies  management expects that non residential mortgage and commercial loans will constitute a greater percentage of the company s loan portfolio in future periods 
as a consequence of management s lending strategy  the company may  in future periods  depending upon then current conditions  increase its provision for loan losses as well as its provision for losses on real estate owned over that experienced in the company s most recent fiscal period 
results of operations as discussed more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company changed from a fiscal year end of march st to a calendar year end  effective with the calendar year commencing january  for purposes of setting forth a meaningful comparison for management s discussion and analysis  the following periods are presented years ended december  and and nine months ended december  and selected consolidated statements of income set forth on the next page are the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and and the nine months ended december  and the information for the year ended december  and the nine months ended december  should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein

includes a pre tax charge of  representing the company s portion of a one time industry wide assessment on thrift institutions to recapitalize the savings association insurance fund saif 
the assessment reduced net income by  or per share 
exclusive of the saif assessment  the net income of the company for was million  or per share  which is an increase of million over net income 
this increase is primarily the result of increased loans and investments  which the company has made since september  that has lead to higher net interest income  partially offset by increased non interest expense incurred to position the company for the growth which it has experienced 
net interest income 
net interest income is the principal source of income for the company and represents the difference between total interest and fees earned on loans  mortgage backed securities and other investments and total interest paid on deposits and other liabilities 
net interest income of million for increased million  or  from million in this increase is the result of an increase in interest income larger than the increase in interest expense 
table presents a summary of the company s average balances  the yields earned on average assets and the cost of average liabilities and shareholders equity for the years ended december  and  and the nine months ended december  and interest income 
interest income of million was up million  or  in over interest income of million 
the increase reflects a rise in average interest earning assets during compared to  as a result of asset investments funded by the proceeds of the company s initial public offering at the end of september  increased borrowing during from the federal home loan bank of new york fhlbny  and increased core deposits during the average balance of total interest earning assets for increased million to million from million during  principally from growth in first mortgage lending and from fourth quarter investments in mortgage backed securities 
during  as part of its strategy  the company increased its net loan portfolio including non residential mortgages and commercial loans  which increased to million at december  compared to million at december  in addition  during a full year s income was earned from investments made during the fourth quarter 
the company s mortgage lending in was at market rates which were less than those imbedded in its prior year s average balances 
this was largely offset by redeployment of proceeds from sales of lower yielding securities into higher yielding assets 
the combined effect of these factors upon average yields for was a reduction of basis points to from in the decrease in the actual balance of interest earning assets at december  as compared to the average balance reflects the sale during the latter part of of mortgage backed securities and debt securities  which were all held as available for sale 
the proceeds were used to repay borrowings and to fund growth in the company s net loan portfolio 
the increase in average yield on the balance sheet for december  over the average yield for the full year reflects the change in the mix of the interest earning assets which occurred during the latter part of this increased the yield on interest earning assets by basis points to at december  as compared to for the full year ending interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  during compared to the previous year 
of this  interest expense on borrowed funds increased million and interest expense on deposits increased million 
as table indicates  the increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was due to a significant increase in the average balance of outstanding borrowings at average rates substantially lower than those of the prior year  and the increase in interest expense on deposits results from more core deposits in than  at slightly higher rates 
the average balance of borrowed funds during increased million  or  to million as compared to the same period for this increase in borrowings reflects implementation of the company s strategy to leverage its excess capital 
these borrowings  along with increased deposits and the capital provided through the company s initial public offering  have funded the increase in assets which has occurred since september the weighted average borrowing cost decreased during by basis points from in to in the decrease reflects the company s decision in december to repay million of higher cost  longer term borrowings and replace it with short term  lower cost to day borrowings 
the company maintained that duration with all of its borrowings until december when it replaced million of its short term borrowings with a five year  borrowing from the fhlbny  which is callable after three years 
at december   the company s remaining short term borrowings were million  which mature within days 
subsequent to year end  the company increased its short term borrowings to purchase million of mortgage backed securities which have weighted average lives consistent with five year treasury instruments 
the company may seek to extend up to million of its short term borrowings to longer maturities  depending upon interest rate market conditions 
if such borrowings are not extended  the company anticipates renewing such borrowings on a short term basis 
the average balance of interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million for from million in also  the average cost of interest on interest bearing deposits grew to during as compared to for the previous year 
this cost increase primarily reflects the full period s effect of changes in the company s costs of certificates of deposits made when the company began  in late  to market cd s with competitive rates  generally for terms of less than months in conjunction with advertising campaigns geared toward re emphasizing the company s presence in its markets 
although these rates were not the highest in the company s market territory  they were higher than those it traditionally offered 
it continued with these rate offerings when the company opened new branches in june and december of and march and october of in addition  interest rates on savings accounts have increased as a result of paying bonuses on statement savings accounts  on a limited basis  to customers of those new branches 
also  during mid third quarter of  the company started to market its products  including deposits to affinity groups 
under this program  the company offers higher savings rates which are tied to the three month us treasury rate 
the company believes that the higher interest rate is economically feasible since service under this program is principally electronic and has limited operational and incremental costs 
this program also has the advantage of soliciting new customers with profiles to match loan products that the company is marketing

the provision for loan losses increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the prior year 
the provision for was determined by management after review of  among other things  the company s loan portfolio  the risks inherent in the company s lending activities and the local economy in the company s market areas 
as of december   non performing loans  defined as non accrual loans and accruing loans delinquent days or more  decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  compared to million at december   a decrease of million  or 
despite this decrease  the percentage of the allowance for loan losses to total non performing loans increased to at december  from at december  because million of a million non performing construction loan was repaid during the remaining balance on this loan of  was charged against a specific reserve of million which had previously been established for this loan 
after the charge off  the remaining balance of the specific reserve was allocated within the allowance for loan losses to other classes of loans 
future provisions for loan losses will continue to be based on management s assessment of the loan portfolio and its underlying collateral  trends in non performing loans  then current economic conditions and other factors which warrant recognition in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels sufficient to provide for estimated losses 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased million to million for compared to million for the principal reason was the loss of million on the sale of securities during as compared to a loss of  on the sale of securities for the securities sold in had an approximate book value of million 
proceeds from the sales  in conjunction with additional borrowings and deposits  were used to fund loan growth and for redeployment into higher yielding securities 
the effect of this loss was to reduce earnings per share by 
aside from the effect of the above described securities transactions  includes thousand from the collection of unaccrued interest associated with loans  the principal of which has been repaid  as compared to thousand in collections for the same period of the prior year 
the interest on all of these loans has been completely repaid 
the effect of this non recurring income to earnings per share was 
absent the above mentioned losses and credits  non interest income decreased thousand during the full year as compared to the same period of the prior year 
this decrease occurred in the first quarter of  primarily due to decreases in commissions from annuity sales as the company focused its resources on developing its new branches and marketing its core products rather than selling annuities 
non interest expense 
non interest expense totaled million for  an increase of million  or  as compared to million incurred during the prior year 
exclusive of the saif assessment  total non interest expense increased million  or  to million for from million in salaries and employee benefits expenses for increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
of this amount  approximately million was related to increased staffing requirements necessary to position the company to achieve its marketing and operational objectives  including increased executive and loan administrative staff  and staffing and training for the company s three new branches opened during the period since december other salary and benefit expenses  incurred for the same reason  include provisions for additional incentive programs for employees at all levels of the company  including million associated with the company s employee stock ownership plan esop established september  and million the recognition and retention plan for executive officers and employees employee rrp adopted midway through finally  salary and benefit expenses also reflect normal salary increases from salary in place during the same period of the prior year 
occupancy costs increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase is principally the result of new lease costs for the three new branches the company has opened since the quarter ended december  and the related amortization of lease hold improvements to these branches as well as refurbishment of existing facilities 
data processing expense increased million  or  to million for compared to million for the prior year 
this increase reflects additional costs as the company upgraded its operating system and all of its applications to provide more capability for services to its customers base 
foreclosed real estate expense  net decreased million  or  to million from million for the primary reason for this decrease was lower real estate tax  insurance  maintenance and repair expenses associated with foreclosed properties as compared to the prior year 
other non interest expense increased million  or  to million compared to million for the prior year  principally due to advertising and promotional expenses in conjunction with the growth of core deposits and the promotions associated with loan growth and new branches 
income tax expense 
income taxes for reflects the tax effect of the pre tax income recognized for  partially offset by a reversal of a  tax liability  previously established  which expired during the effect of this reversal was to increase earnings per share for income tax expense for is solely the result of the tax effect of the pre tax income recognized in that period 
financial condition at december  shareholders equity was million compared to million at december  the ratios of shareholders equity to total assets were at december  and at december  the million decrease in shareholders equity at december  from december  resulted principally from purchase on the open market and retirement of  shares of stock for million at an average price of per share  purchase of  shares on the open market to fund the company s management recognition and retention plans  of which a  shares  valued at million  were awarded during and b  shares  valued at  were retained as treasury stock held for reissuance under these plans  a million net of tax decrease in the market value of the investment portfolio  all of which is classified as available for sale  and the third and fourth quarter dividend of  partially offsetting these decreases were net income of million and the reduction of  in the unallocated and unearned esop  employee rrp  and recognition and retention plan for outside directors director rrp shares 
total assets at december  were million  an increase of million from the december  year end balance of million 
lending activities was the principal reason for this growth 
the growth has been primarily funded with fhlbny borrowings and by increased deposits 
lending activities loan portfolio composition 
at december   the company had total loans of million  an increase of million  or from december  the largest component of the portfolio  million  or  were one to four family first mortgage loans 
the remainder of the company s loans at december  consisted of consumer and other loans of million  or  of total loans  primarily home equity credit lines  fixed rate second mortgage loans and fha title insured home improvement loans 
commercial business and mortgage loans  and multi family mortgage loans outstanding at december  totaled million  or  of total loans and million  or  of total loans  respectively 
the types of loans that the company may originate or purchase are subject to federal and state law regulations 
interest rates charged by the company on loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans and the supply of money available for lending purposes and the rates offered by its competitors 
these factors are  in turn  affected by general economic conditions  monetary policies of the federal government  including the federal reserve board  legislative tax policies and governmental budgetary matters 
first mortgage lending 
the company offers first mortgage loans secured by one to four family residences  including townhouse and condominium units 
typically  such residences are single family homes that serve as the primary residence of the owner 
loans may be internally originated or purchased from other sources such as mortgage bankers and other financial intermediaries 
one to four family residential mortgage loans are generally underwritten to federal national mortgage association fnma or federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc guidelines  except that loans may exceed the maximum loan limits for the fnma or the fhlmc 
at december   one to four family first mortgage loans amounted to million  a million  or increase from december  the increase over the prior year resulted primarily from the purchase and origination of million and million of one to four family residential loans  respectively 
of the one to four family first mortgage loans outstanding at the current year end  were arm loans and were fixed rate loans 
the interest rate adjustment period on arm loans ranges between and years  and as of december  the weighted average adjustment period approximates years 
the company periodically offers arm loans on which the interest rate for an initial period may be less than the fully indexed rate  although to be eligible  the company requires that the borrower qualify for the maximum payment possible after the initial interest rate adjustment 
arm and fixed rate loans are originated for a term of up to years 
the company generally charges origination fees of up to on one to four family residential mortgage loans 
generally  arm loans pose credit risks different from the risks in fixed rate loans  primarily because as interest rates rise  the underlying payments of the borrower rise  thereby increasing the potential for default 
at the same time  the marketability of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates 
the company also engages in commercial and multi family real estate lending in its market area 
the company s commercial and multi family real estate loan portfolio is secured primarily by apartment buildings  mixed use buildings  small office buildings and warehouses 
commercial and multi family real estate loans generally have terms that do not exceed years and have a variety of rate adjustment features and other terms 
the loans are usually made in amounts up to of the appraised value of the property securing the loan 
adjustable rate commercial and multi family real estate loans provide for a margin over either the us treasury security adjusted to a constant maturity of five years  with periodic adjustments after five years  or the prime rate as reported in the wall street journal  or to a lesser extent  the company also offers commercial and multi family real estate loans with a margin over short term us treasury securities 
in underwriting these loans  the company analyzes the current financial condition of the borrower  the borrower s credit history  and the reliability and predictability of the cash flow generated by the property securing the loan 
the company generally requires personal guarantees of the borrowers 
appraisals on properties securing commercial real estate loans originated by the company are performed by independent appraisers approved by the company s board of directors 
multi family and commercial real estate loans present a higher level of risk than loans secured by one to four family residences 
this greater risk is due to several factors  including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers  the effect of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans 
furthermore  the repayment of loans secured by multi family and commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project 
if the cash flow from the project is reduced for example  if leases are not obtained or renewed  or a bankruptcy court modifies a lease term  or a major tenant is unable to fulfill its lease obligations  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
at december   million  or  of the company s total loan portfolio consisted of acquisition  development and construction loans  as compared to million at december  during  million of a million non accruing construction loan was repaid 
the remaining balance of  was charged off against a specific reserve which had previously been established for the loan 
after the charge off  the remaining balance of the specific reserve was allocated within the allowance for loan losses to other classes of loans 
other loans 
among other loan types  the company offers second mortgages secured by owner occupied residences wherein the property may not be encumbered by other than a first mortgage loan 
these loans are generally subject to a combined loan to value limitation  including any other outstanding mortgage or lien on the property 
as of december   second mortgage loans amounted to million  or  of total loans  an increase of million  or  from december  the company also originates and purchases fha title improvement loans 
it originates these loans both on a direct basis and through a network of improvement contractors dealers who are approved by the company under fha guidelines 
the company purchases fha title improvement loans from fha approved lenders who have originated the loans in accord with the company s lending criteria and within fha underwriting guidelines 
these guidelines provide for more liberal equity and debt to income ratios than for non fha improvement loans 
in the event of default  the fha insures of the principal balance plus accrued interest 
the interest rates are normally higher than the interest rates for one to four family mortgage loans due to the more liberal underwriting standards 
fha title improvement loans amounted to million  or  of total loans at december  compared to million as of december   an increase of million  or 
in accordance with its strategy  the company began to originate commercial business loans in these loans are secured by business assets other than real estate such as equipment  inventory  machinery  accounts receivable  and vehicles  and are generally guaranteed by principals of the business 
commercial business loans are in amounts which range from  to  at interest rates which are indexed to the prime rate  and for durations which coincide with the nature of the collateral  but not beyond ten years 
the company s target market is enterprises with annual sales between million and million 
commercial business loans present a higher level of risk than do loans secured by one to four family residences 
the company underwrites these loans by analyzing the current financial condition of the borrower including current and expected cash flows and historical and projected financial performance 
the company also analyzes the value of the collateral available as security  and the borrower s credit history 
the company seeks to maintain an active relationship with its commercial business borrowers in order to service their banking needs  and to keep current with their financial and operational condition 
as of december   the amount of commercial business loans was million versus zero at december  remaining other loans are home equity lines of credit and secured and unsecured personal loans 
as of december   million  or  of the company s total loan portfolio  consisted of multi family residential mortgage loans reflecting an increase of million  or from year end december  in addition  the company s commercial business and mortgage loan portfolio totaled million  or  of the total loan portfolio at december   an increase of million  or  from december  the growth of these product lines reflects management s emphasis and strategy of diversifying the company s loan offerings and portfolio mix  and the result of increased marketing and support activities

maintenance of asset quality is one of management s most important objectives 
management reviews delinquent loans on a continuous basis and  through an asset classification committee which meets quarterly to review the company s loan portfolio  makes changes in the classification of assets which the committee deems necessary 
the committee reports its findings to the board of directors quarterly 
the company hires outside counsel experienced in collections and foreclosure to pursue collections and to institute foreclosure and other procedures on the company s delinquent loans 
lending policies are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors of the company 
credit approval limits have been established for each of the company s loan officers  however  the company s loan committee approves all credit extensions exceeding  it is the company s policy for loans secured by real estate that an appraisal be obtained to ensure adequate value of the secured property and that title insurance be obtained on all first mortgage loans 
the company has engaged an independent consulting firm which specializes in loan reviews to perform loan reviews and provide independent reports to the company s board of directors quarterly 
in addition  loan officers monitor the company s loans outstanding to identify potentially deteriorating loan situations which are reported to the asset review committee 
this process allows management to implement a strategy to address potential credit concerns 
the company s internal audit department reviews loan documentation and collateral as part of its regular audit procedures 
delinquent loans and foreclosed assets federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities considered by the office of thrift supervision ots to be of lesser quality as substandard  doubtful  or loss assets 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the savings institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weakness inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets that do not expose the savings institution to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but which possess some weaknesses  are required to be designated special mention by management 
loans designated as special mention are generally loans that have exhibited some potential weakness that  if not corrected  could increase the level of risk in the future 
at december   the company had special mention loans of million 
in addition  at that date the company had substandard assets of million  which consisted of million in real estate owned reo  million in first and second mortgage loans and million in consumer loans 
there were no assets categorized as doubtful at that date and there were million categorized as loss which are fully reserved 
reo is transferred from the loan portfolio at the lower of cost or estimated fair value 
if the estimated fair value is lower than cost  such difference is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of transfer 
the company also maintains a loss allowance for other real estate losses for subsequent declines in the estimated fair value of reo and estimated costs to sell 
interest is not accrued on fha insured home improvement loans where interest or principal is days or more past due  and on all other loans  where interest or principal is days or more past due  unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
once the loans reach non accrual status  accrued but unpaid interest is reversed and interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent that payments are received 
interest on loans that have been restructured is accrued according to the renegotiated terms 
table below sets forth information regarding the company s non performing assets 
at december   the company had no restructured loans within the meaning of statement of financial accounting standards sfas and sfas issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb table non performing assets at december  at march  dollars in thousands mortgage loans delinquent days more and still accruing non accrual delinquent mortgage loans      non accrual construction loans     other non accrual loans delinquent days or more total non performing loans      total reo   total non performing assets      non performing loans to total net loans

in addition to the loans included in the risk elements table above  the company has at december   loans delinquent for days or less totaling thousand  of which thousand has been classified as substandard 
these loans  as well as the loans included in the risk elements table above  have been considered in the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
for the year ended december  and and the nine months ended december  and  the amounts of interest income that would have been recorded on non accrual loans  had they been current  approximated million  million  million and million  respectively 
also  during the twelve months ended december  and and the nine months ended december the amounts of interest income on non performing loans that was included in income approximated thousand  thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
the company s real estate owned  before allowance for losses on real estate owned reo  totaled thousand at december  as compared to thousand at december  during  reductions in the fair market value of reo properties were thousand 
in addition  thousand of new reo was acquired which was offset by the sale of thousand in existing reo properties 
the sales in real estate owned reflects the continued efforts of the company to reduce of reo outstanding in a timely manner 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through charges provisions for loan losses to earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the recovery of principal is unlikely 
if  as a result of loans charged off or increases in the size or risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  management considers the allowance to be below the level necessary to absorb future loan losses on existing loans  an additional provision for loan losses is made to increase the allowance for loan losses to the level considered necessary to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
management considers such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay and the realization of collateral in determining the adequacy of the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for losses on loans is adequate 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions in the company s market area 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for losses on loans 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
investment activities the company s earning assets  other than loans receivable  are its debt and equity securities  which primarily consist of us government and agency securities  federal funds sold  and mortgage backed securities  which are directly insured or guaranteed by the government national mortgage association gnma  the fnma or the fhlmc

in establishing its investment strategies  the company considers its business and growth plans  the economic environment  its interest rate sensitivity position  the types of securities to be held  and other factors 
current regulatory and accounting guidelines regarding investment portfolio policy require securities to be classified as held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
in november  the fasb issued special report  a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities within which there was offered transition guidance permitting an enterprise to reassess the appropriateness of the classifications of all of its securities before december  the company reassessed its classifications and on december   it transferred all of its securities previously classified as held to maturity  with an amortized cost of million  to the available for sale classification 
the related unrealized gain as of the date of transfer was  which has been recognized and reported  net of income tax of  as a separate component of shareholders equity 
at december   all of the company s securities were classified as available for sale 
decisions to purchase or sell these securities are made within the framework of the company s investment policy and are based on economic conditions including changes in interest rates  liquidity  and asset liability management strategies 
decreases in investments during were primarily the result of the sales of million of debt and equity securities  and mortgage backed securities during the third and fourth quarters of proceeds from the sale of securities were used in conjunction with additional borrowings and deposits to fund loan growth and redeployment into higher yielding securities

the company does not actively solicit brokered deposits 
in addition to deposits  the company s sources of funds are primarily borrowings from the fhlbny  loan and mortgage backed security repayments and cash flow generated from operations including interest payments on loans and debt securities and fees 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms 
the company presently offers passbook accounts  checking accounts  now accounts  money market accounts  fixed interest rate certificates of deposit with varying maturities and individual retirement accounts ira s 
the company emphasizes retention of its core deposits  as management believes that these deposits are a much more stable source of funds and are less sensitive to changes in the market level of interest rates 
however  depending on its funding needs  interest rate risk management and other considerations  the company may from time to time emphasize the origination of certificates of deposit  as it did during parts of and at december  and  the percentage of core deposits to total deposits was and  respectively 
deposits grew million from million at december  to million at december  this increase is principally the result of increased marketing efforts by the company and the addition of three branches since december during this period the mix in the deposits has changed toward lower yielding core deposits 
the mix was also affected by the company s marketing strategy 
during  interest rates paid to retail depositors have been rising within the company s market area 
in response  the company developed products which placed emphasis on customer relationships rather than matching the most aggressively priced certificates of deposits offerings by its competition 
as a result  there has been runoff in certificates of deposits primarily from depositors who do not have other accounts with the company  while core deposits have increased 
also during the third quarter of the company started to market its products  including deposits  to affinity groups 
under this program  the company offers a higher statement savings rate which is tied to the three month us treasury rate 
the company believes that the higher interest rate is economically feasible since service under this program is principally electronic  and has limited operational and incremental costs 
this program also has the advantage of soliciting new customers with profiles to match loan products the company is marketing 
during calendar year  million of the company s certificates of deposit will be maturing 
these certificates currently carry interest rates ranging from to and a weighted average interest rate of 
as of december   the company s current interest rates offered  for certificates with similar maturities  were between and 
management does not believe that the maturity of these time deposits will have a material impact to the company s liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity is a measure of its ability to fund loans and withdrawals of deposits in a cost effective manner 
the company s primary financing sources are deposits obtained in its own market area  advances from the fhlbny and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
other sources of funds include scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage backed securities  maturities of debt securities and funds provided by operations 
at december   the company had total liquid assets consisting of cash due from banks  federal funds sold  debt and mortgage backed securities  having final maturities within one year  and accrued interest from debt and mortgage backed securities  which represented of total assets and of total deposits at december  at december  the company had available to it million under a line of credit with the fhlbny  expiring october  and  approximately million of excess collateral pledged with the fhlbny 
in addition  the company has approximately million in unpledged debt  equity and mortgage backed securities which could be used to collateralize additional borrowings 
finally  all of the company s securities are available for sale 
at december   capital resources were sufficient to meet outstanding loan commitments of million  commitments on unused lines of credit of million and commercial letters of credit of million 
certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december  totaled million 
management is unable to predict the amount of such deposits that will renew with the company 
as a result of the company s liquidity position  management does not believe the company s operations will be materially affected by a failure to renew these deposits 
however  experience indicates that a significant portion of such deposits should remain with the company 
during the year ended december   the principal requirement for funds was for lending activities 
purchase and originations of loans exceeded principal collections by million 
the principal sources of funding for lending were increases in borrowings from the fhlbny  net of repayments of million  an excess of principal repayments  maturities  calls and sales of mortgage backed securities and debt and equity securities over purchases of mortgage backed securities of million and an increase in deposits of million 
during the nine months ended december   lending and investment activities were the principal requirements for funding 
purchase and originations of loans exceeded principal collections and repayments by million 
purchases of debt  equity and mortgage backed securities exceeded principal repayments  maturities and sales proceeds by million 
the principal sources of funding for these investments were an increase in deposits of million  borrowings  net of repayments  from the fhlbny of million and net proceeds from the company s initial public offering of million 
liquidity management of the company is both a daily and long term component of management s strategy 
purchases of mortgage backed securities increased in the beginning of  as the company sought to balance its investment portfolio with the addition of higher yielding intermediate term instruments 
these purchases were funded through short term borrowings from the fhlbny 
concurrently  growth in net loans occurred which also was funded through short term fhlbny borrowings 
late in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter as interest rates began to fall  the company sold lower yielding debt and mortgage backed securities and used the proceeds to reduce fhlbny borrowings which had spiked during the middle of to fund loan growth 
late in the fourth quarter as interest rates dropped to the lowest point since the beginning of the year  the company extended the maturity date of million of its short term borrowings to a five year term  callable at the option of the fhlbny after three years  at a rate of 
at december   the company s remaining short term borrowings  which all mature within ninety days  were million 
consistent with its strategy of leveraging its excess capital  the company purchased million of mortgage backed securities  subsequent to december  these subsequent purchases are classified as available for sale and have weighted average lives consistent with five year treasury securities 
the company may seek to extend up to million of its short term borrowings to longer maturities  depending upon interest rate market conditions 
if such borrowings are not extended  the company anticipates renewing such borrowings on a short term basis 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the principal objective of the company s asset and liability management is to identify  evaluate  and manage a level of interest rate risk appropriate to the company s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements  and to attain a stable net interest margin across a wide range of interest rate environments 
the company monitors the levels of interest rates  the relationships between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities  the absolute amount of assets and liabilities which reprice or mature over similar periods  and the effect of these factors on the estimated level of net interest income 
the company s actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the asset liability committee alco comprised of management with oversight provided by the board of directors 
the alco s review includes the sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  market conditions and interest rates  and cash flow needs with regard to investment activity and deposit flow 
one of the monitoring tools used by the alco is an analysis of the extent to which assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and one that measures the company s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
accordingly  during a period of rising interest rates  an institution with a negative gap position would not be in as favorable a position  as compared with an institution with a positive gap  to invest in higher yielding assets 
this may result in the yield on the institution s assets increasing at a slower rate than the increase in its cost of interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a negative gap would experience a repricing of its assets at a slower rate than its interest bearing liabilities  which  consequently  may result in its net interest income growing at a faster rate than an institution with a positive gap position 
in addition to the gap analysis  the company uses income simulation modeling in measuring its interest rate risk and managing its interest rate sensitivity 
income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income  but also other factors such as yield curve relationships  the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  customer preferences  and general market conditions 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  that the company anticipates  based upon certain assumptions  will reprice or mature in each of the future time periods presented 
except as noted  the amount of assets and liabilities which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
the company s loan prepayment assumptions are per annum for arm loans  and a range of to per annum based upon the underlying interest rate for all other loans 
non accrual loans  deferred premiums  fees and unearned discounts have been excluded from the table 
the liability assumptions include annual decay rates of for money market accounts  for passbook accounts  and for now accounts  based upon historical data 
a decay rate is the percentage of run off or decay in the liability balance from one earlier point in time to another point later in time 
based on these assumptions  net interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year of december  exceeded net interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period by million  representing a negative cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap of to total assets 
accordingly  an increase in market interest rates would be expected to have an adverse impact on net interest income

for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets  such as arm loans  have features which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of borrowers to service their arm loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
comparison of operating results for the nine months ended december  and general 
net income for the nine months ended december  fiscal was million  compared with million for the nine months ended december  this decrease of million was primarily the result of higher interest expense and non interest expenses associated with the efforts of the company to position itself for future growth  partially offset by increases in interest income and collection of unaccrued interest income 
net interest income 
for fiscal  net interest income decreased million  or  to million from million for the same period in the prior year 
this decrease is the result of an increase in interest expense larger than the increase in interest income 
interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the comparable period in the growth in interest income is principally the result of an increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets 
the average balance of total interest earning assets increased million during fiscal to million from million for the nine months ended december   and the average yield on total interest earning assets increased to for fiscal from for the comparable period during the change in the average balances of interest earning assets between fiscal and the same period in the prior year was principally affected by investment of the proceeds from the company s initial public offering at the end of september  and investment of funds borrowed from the fhlbny during the last quarter of fiscal  partially offset by mortgage loan and mortgage backed securities principal amortization and prepayments  as accelerated due to a decrease in long term interest rates during fiscal interest earning assets most affected by this net increase in average balances were first mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
mortgage loans had a small decrease  and mortgage backed securities had a small increase during fiscal from the nine months ended december   as the impact of the september funds infusion to the respective average balance calculations was offset for mortgage loans  and largely offset for mortgage backed securities  by the amortization and prepayments of principal 
growth in the average balance of investment securities during fiscal over the comparable period in occurred throughout the nine month period in as the cash flow from amortization of mortgage and mortgage backed securities principal was reinvested into shorter term government and agency obligations 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  during fiscal compared to the same period in the previous year 
this increase was primarily attributable to a million  or  increase in interest expense on deposits from million during the nine months ended december  to million during fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a change between periods in the mix of deposits to higher cost time deposits  and an increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits by million  or  partially offset by a decline in the average balance of borrowed funds during fiscal when compared to the same period in the prior year 
the change in the mix of deposits began during when interest rates increased 
the company responded by offering new deposit products with market interest rates  rather than significantly changing interest rates on existing products 
the result was a migration from now accounts into cd products whose terms were generally less than months 
the mix was also affected by the company s marketing strategy 
in december and into calendar when the company was making its decision to commence with its initial public offering  the company started offering market competitive cd rates  generally for terms of less than months  in conjunction with advertising campaigns geared toward reemphasizing the company s presence in its markets 
although these rates were not the highest in the company s market territory  they were higher than those it traditionally offered 
subsequently  as the company opened two new supermarket branches  it continued with these rate offerings as well as paying bonuses to statement savings rates  on a limited basis  to customers of those new branches 
also during fiscal the company started to market its products  including deposits  to affinity groups 
the average balance of borrowed funds decreased million during fiscal from the same period during the prior year  while the weighted average borrowing cost rose basis points to 
this combined to result in a decrease in interest expense on borrowed funds of   to million during fiscal from million during the nine months ended december  the increase in the average cost of borrowings reflected higher cost advances taken during calender when interest rates were rising 
in december  the company prepaid million  representing the then outstanding amount of these advances  and incurred a prepayment penalty fee of  reflected  net of tax  as an extraordinary item in the consolidated statement of income 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for fiscal decreased  or  to  for the nine months ended december  from  for the nine months ended december  the provision for fiscal was determined by management after review of  among other things  the company s loan portfolio  the risks inherent in the company s lending activities and the local economy in the company s market areas 
as of december   non performing loans  defined as non accrual loans and accruing loans delinquent days or more  decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at march  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  compared to million at march   an increase of million  or 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non performing loans increased to at december  from at march  due primarily to the decrease in non performing loans 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for the same period ended december  the principal reasons for this increase were recognition of income from the collection of unaccrued interest  partially offset by a loss from the sale of debt securities 
during fiscal  in connection with the workout of a non performing loan  the company received million in accord with the terms of a bankruptcy settlement  representing principal and unaccrued interest 
initial payments under the plan were applied to principal which was repaid in its entirety during fiscal subsequent payments  representing unaccrued interest  totaled million during fiscal and were reflected in non interest income 
the loss on the sale of debt securities occurred during the last quarter of calendar when the company sold million of such securities having an average yield of  incurring a loss of  there were no sales of securities during the same time period in the preceding year 
the remaining components of non interest income are service charges and fees for checking accounts and loans  as well as commissions and fees from annuity sales 
these sources remained relatively consistent for fiscal as compared to the same period in the prior year 
non interest expense 
non interest expense  at million for the nine months ended december   increased million  or  from the million incurred during the same period in the prior year 
salaries and employee benefits expenses for fiscal increased million  or  compared to the same period during the prior year 
of this amount  approximately million was related to increased staffing requirements necessary to position the company to achieve its marketing and operational objectives  including increased executive and loan administrative staff  and staffing and training for the company s new supermarket branches 
other salary and benefit expenses  incurred for the same reason  include provisions for additional incentive programs for employees at all levels of the company  including million associated with the company s esop established september  finally  fiscal salary and benefit expenses also reflect million of normal salary increases from salary in place during the same period of the prior year 
occupancy costs increased million  or  to million for the nine months ended december  from million for the nine months ended december  the increase is principally the result of refurbishment of existing facilities and the amortization of leasehold improvements to the new supermarket branches 
professional fees for fiscal increased million  or  compared to the nine month period a year ago 
these increases primarily resulted from various marketing  profitability and data processing studies being performed during fiscal  while no similar work had been performed during the same period of the prior year 
other non interest expense  which increased million  or for the nine months ended december   amounted to million  compared to million for the nine months ended december  an increase in board of directors fees and expenses was a principal component of this increase  reflecting both a change in compensation to those members of the board of directors who are not officers of the company or the bank and also reflecting that no expense was recognized during the nine months ended december  for any portion of the annual retainers  paid in january to board members  for serving on the board and its committees 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased million  or  to million for the nine months ended december  from million for the similar period during the prior year  principally as a result of the decrease in income before income taxes  extraordinary item and cumulative effect of accounting change of million  or  for the nine months ended december  from the nine months ended december  impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does the effect of inflation
