the company s business is highly seasonal  reflecting the general pattern associated with the retail industry of peak sales and earnings during the christmas season 
due to the importance of the christmas selling season  the fourth quarter of each fiscal year has historically contributed  and the company expects it will continue to contribute  a disproportionate percentage of the company s net sales and most of its net income for the entire fiscal year 
any factors negatively affecting the company during the christmas selling season in any year  including unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company generally experiences lower sales and earnings during the first three quarters and  as is typical in the retail industry  has incurred and may continue to incur losses in these quarters 
the results of operations for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year 
in addition  the company makes decisions regarding merchandise well in advance of the season in which it will be sold  particularly for the christmas selling season 
significant deviations from projected demand for products could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations  either by lost sales due to insufficient inventory or lost margin due to the need to mark down excess inventory 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate based upon such factors as the number and timing of store openings and related preopening store expenses  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  the mix of products sold  the timing and level of markdowns  store closings  refurbishments or relocations  competitive factors and general economic conditions

net cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended february  totaled million  an increase of million over the eleven months ended february  lower interest expense resulting from the paydown of outstanding debt  operating profit on higher sales and a higher level of payables due to an earlier easter contributed to the increase

the proceeds were used to retire the million long term note payable and pay down the million balance then outstanding on the revolving credit line

on may  the company terminated its existing line of credit and concurrently entered into a new revolving line of credit agreement with bank of america which expires may  the new agreement allows for cash borrowings and letters of credit of up to million from january through june and million from july though december of each year
