item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item business  item selected financial data  the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the information described under the caption risk factors below 
overview the company was founded in to develop  manufacture and market automated explosives detection systems following the bombing of pan american flight over lockerbie  scotland 
following its organization  the company undertook extensive research and development  introducing its first free standing automated explosives detection system  the h  in  and its first integrated automated explosives detection systems for level and level screening  the vis and vds  in the company commenced commercial shipments of its vis and vds systems in january as of september   the company had shipped and installed more than systems for use in airports throughout europe  and in the asia pacific region 
in the company introduced the model aps  a freestanding system to screen carry on baggage for explosives and weapons 
the model aps can also be used in the non aviation market to screen baggage at public  private and government facilities 
the first unit was sold in june to the public intelligence department in riyadh  saudi arabia for the protection of vip s 
in november  the company received an order for seven model aps systems for the new terminal one at jfk international airport in new york 
this will be the first terminal in the world to screen all carry on baggage for explosives 
the company s sales are primarily to owners and operators of airports  including foreign governments and regulatory authorities 
the company s revenues are derived primarily from product sales 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment to the customer  provided that no significant company obligations remain outstanding and collection of the related receivable is deemed probable by management 
the company accrues for anticipated warranty and installation costs upon shipment 
the company s revenues also include government research and development grants and revenues from service  the sale of spare parts and training  which have comprised less than of revenues in the periods presented 
the company recognizes revenues under its development grants as services are rendered 
in may  the company received a two year  million research and development grant from the faa to fund  in part  the development of a cost effective  high speed explosive detection system  based upon the company s current proprietary technology  that is intended to meet faa certification requirements 
the company commenced work under this grant in the third quarter of fiscal the grant is subject to termination by the government at any time 
in fiscal   and the company recognized million  million  and million respectively  in development revenue from faa grants 
the company has an exclusive perpetual license to use certain patent rights and technology developed by hologic for the development  manufacture and sale of x ray screening security systems for explosives  drugs  currency and other contraband subject to termination by either party for certain defined defaults 
the company also has a nonexclusive license to use these patents and technology for the development  manufacture and sale of x ray based products which may be used for process control applications in the food and beverage industries 
see risk factors limited protection of intellectual property rights  patent litigation and item certain relationships and related transactions 
the company s cost of revenues includes a royalty payable with respect to product sales and other revenues derived from the license with hologic 
under the terms of this exclusive agreement  this royalty was reduced from to of revenues derived from such license in january upon the company reaching million in cumulative revenues subject to the exclusive license 
upon the company reaching million of cumulative revenues subject to this exclusive license  the royalty will be eliminated entirely 
as of september   the company had reached approximately million in cumulative revenues 
see item business intellectual property and item certain relationships and related transactions 
in fiscal  and  sales to baa accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of revenues 
additionally  in fiscal airport authority hong kong and toyo kanetsu kk  the baggage handling contractor for malaysia s kuala lumpur international airport  accounted for and of the company s revenues 
the company expects that its revenues from these customers will decrease and will become increasingly dependent upon sales of upgrades  replacement equipment and services 
the failure of the company to obtain orders from customers other than these customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
see risk factors customer concentration 
substantially all of the company s revenues have been generated by sales to customers outside the united states 
the company s foreign sales have occurred principally in the united kingdom  other western european countries and more recently in the asia pacific region 
in fiscal  the company received orders for and systems at the kuala lumpur international airport in malaysia and chek lap kok airport in hong kong  respectively  the first two airports in the asia pacific region that are adopting the integrated automated explosives detection approach 
the company shipped all systems to kuala lumpur in fiscal  and received a repeat order for three systems to be used at level to be delivered in fiscal as of september   the company had shipped of the systems to hong kong 
the company has sales and service offices in the united kingdom and malaysia to support its european and asia pacific operations  respectively  and has expanded its presence in europe and the middle east 
the company expects international sales to remain an important component of its business 
the company s export sales generally have been denominated in united states dollars 
however  during fiscal approximately of the company s revenues were denominated in foreign currencies 
the company on occasion has hedged its foreign currency exposure by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that these hedging efforts will be successful

results of operations for the periods indicated  the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues represented by the respective line items in the company s consolidated statement of operations year ended september  revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative litigation expenses total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  revenues 
revenues increased by approximately to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase in revenues primarily was the result of an increase in product sales 
the increase in product sales was primarily attributable to the total number of product shipments to europe as well as the commencement of shipments to chek lap kok airport in hong kong and shipments to kuala lumpur international airport in malaysia  partially offset by slightly lower average selling prices of the company s products 
during fiscal  the company shipped and installed units compared to units in fiscal gross margin 
gross margin increased to of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal the increase in gross margin in fiscal was primarily attributable to the decrease  commencing in january  in royalties due to hologic for the exclusive license of certain patents and technology from to  as well as decreased costs attributable to improved manufacturing efficiencies recognized during the year 
these decreases were partially offset by lower average selling prices 
during the second half of fiscal  the company s product sales consisted primarily of sales of the newly introduced vis m and vds ii as well as sde upgrades 
during fiscal  the company was able to reduce certain component costs and achieve other manufacturing efficiencies in the design of the vis m and vds ii  which substantially offset lower average selling prices 
the company also had a significant increase in sales of upgrades  parts and maintenance in fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal the company began recognizing revenue under the million faa research grant 
this grant did not have a material impact on gross margins during fiscal research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by approximately to million of revenues in fiscal from million of revenues in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal was primarily due to the addition of engineering personnel and outside consultants working on the development of new products and enhancements to existing products  including enhancements to the model aps system for carry on baggage and the vis m matrix configuration 
certain expenses in connection with the development of the company s next generation system have been included in costs of goods sold in connection with the most recent faa research and development grant 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses declined in the current year  reflecting increased revenues in fiscal selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased approximately to million of revenues in fiscal from million of revenues in fiscal the increase in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal primarily was due to additional sales and support personnel  as a result of the expansion of operations in europe and the establishment of operations in the asia pacific region  the payment of commissions to sales representatives in the asia pacific region  and to a lesser extent an increase in advertising  consulting  trade shows and related travel costs 
the company anticipates that it will continue to expand its selling and marketing efforts in fiscal in anticipation of continued growth 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately to million of revenues in fiscal from million of revenues in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and related costs including non recurring costs related to relocation fees as well as additional overhead costs as the headcount for the company increased approximately 
the company anticipates that general and administrative costs will continue to increase in anticipation of continued growth in fiscal litigation expenses 
the company incurred  and million of litigation expenses in fiscal and  respectively  primarily in connection with the company s patent litigation with eg g and to a lesser extent as e 
on november   the company entered into an agreement with eg g to settle eg g s patent infringement claim against the company 
the litigation expenses in fiscal also include expenses incurred in connection with the company s litigation with as e 
in may  the company commenced an action in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against as e seeking a declaration that the company does not infringe as e patents related to back scattered x rays 
this followed as e s allegations of infringement to third parties 
no discovery has been taken to date 
following a court decision in july construing the claims of the as e patent  which decision the company considers favorable  in september the company filed a motion for summary judgment of non infringement 
as e has not yet filed its papers in opposition to the company s motion but is seeking discovery 
if granted  the company s motion will resolve all issues remaining in the case in favor of the company 
earlier  in april  the court dismissed as e s proposed counterclaim seeking to allege patent infringement  so that the only remaining issue in the case is the company s request for declaration of non infringement of two claims of a single as e patent 
as a result of the company s settlement with eg g in november  and the recent court rulings against as e  the company expects litigation expenses to decline in fiscal interest income 
the company recognized net interest income of approximately  in fiscal compared to net interest income of  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to higher average cash balances resulting from the receipt of proceeds from the company s initial public offering 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to no provision for income taxes in fiscal the company s effective tax rate in fiscal was lower than the statutory tax rates primarily due to the use of tax credits and the tax benefits associated with the company s foreign sales corporation 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal was a result of the company s recognition of a deferred tax asset  which reflected management s determination  in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 that it was more likely than not that this deferred tax asset would be utilized 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  revenues 
revenues increased by approximately to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase was the result of an increase in product sales which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue associated with the company s faa development grant 
the increase in product sales was primarily attributable to an increase in unit sales  which was partially offset by lower average selling prices 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased to of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the company s change in product mix  lower average selling prices  and a reduction in revenues associated with the company s faa grant which were partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies 
during fiscal and the first half of fiscal  the company s product sales consisted primarily of sales of the vis w 
during the second half of fiscal  product sales shifted to the newly introduced vis m  vds ii  and sde upgrades  each of which has a lower average selling price than the vis w 
the company was able to reduce certain component costs and achieve other manufacturing efficiencies in the design of the vis m and vds ii  which substantially offset these lower selling prices 
in addition  the company s work under its faa grant was completed in the third quarter of fiscal the effect of this grant increased the company s gross margin by approximately in the first three quarters of fiscal research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased by approximately to million of revenues in fiscal from million of revenues in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to expenditures in fiscal related to the company s development of its vis m product  which was substantially completed by the first quarter of fiscal selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased by approximately to million of revenues in fiscal from million of revenues in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to additional sales and support personnel  and to an increase in advertising  consulting and trade show costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately to million of revenues in fiscal from million of revenues in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and additional overhead costs related to the company s move to a new facility in march litigation expenses 
the company incurred million and million of litigation expenses in fiscal and  respectively  primarily in connection with the company s patent litigation with eg g 
on november   the company entered into an agreement with eg g to settle this litigation 
the litigation expenses in fiscal also included expenses incurred in connection with the company s litigation with as e 
see risk factors limited protection of intellectual property rights  patent litigation  item business intellectual property and item legal proceedings 
interest income expense  net 
the company recognized net interest income of  in fiscal and net interest expense of  in fiscal the change in interest income expense  net was primarily attributable to reduced average borrowings by the company under its bank working capital line of credit 
provision for income taxes 
the company recorded no provision for income taxes in fiscal compared to an effective tax rate of in fiscal the provision for income taxes in fiscal reflected the company s recognition of a deferred tax asset 
if the company had not recognized this deferred tax asset  the company s effective tax rate in fiscal would have been 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has funded its operations and capital expenditures through internally generated cash flow  proceeds from sales of securities and the availability of a working capital line of credit 
in december and january  the company received total net proceeds of approximately million from the initial public offering of its common stock  of which million was used to redeem all of the company s outstanding shares of series a preferred stock and series c preferred stock 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters and item certain relationships and related transactions 
at september   the company had working capital of million  including approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  the company had million of long term investments  none of which have maturities of less than months 
the company also has a million bank line of credit which expires in february the company s bank line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime rate as of september  
the line of credit is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and contains certain financial and other covenants 
at september   the company had no amounts outstanding under this line of credit 
during the fiscal year ended september   the company s net cash used in operating activities was approximately million 
during that period  net income and depreciation and amortization expenses totaling million  were offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventories  a million decrease in accrued expenses 
the increase in inventories and accounts receivable were primarily attributable to the company s increased product sales 
as of november   the company received payments of approximately million against the outstanding receivable balance at september during the fiscal year ended september   the company s net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  primarily reflecting the net purchase of approximately million of short term investments 
cash used in investing activities also included capital expenditures for fiscal of approximately  while the company does not have any significant commitments for capital expenditures  the company anticipates that it will continue to purchase equipment to support its anticipated growth 
during the fiscal year ended september   net cash provided by financing activities was million  primarily attributable to the receipt of net proceeds of approximately million from the initial public offering of the company s common stock and approximately  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the company used approximately million of the net proceeds of the offering to redeem all of its outstanding shares of mandatorily redeemable non convertible preferred stock 
the company does not currently have any significant capital commitments and believes that existing sources of liquidity  including the net proceeds of its initial public offering  funds expected to be generated from operations and its line of credit will provide adequate cash to fund the company s anticipated operational and other cash needs through at least the next twelve months 
however  for a brief discussion of the factors that could adversely affect the company s financial position and results of operations  see risk factors 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 earnings per share  which established new standards for calculating and presenting earnings per share 
the company will adopt this new standard in its fiscal financial statements  which will require the reporting of diluted earnings per share and basic earnings per share  as defined 
sfas no

basic earnings per share would have been  and  respectively  for the same periods 
risk factors this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of the company s plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
customer concentration 
in fiscal  and  sales to baa accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
additionally  in fiscal airport authority hong kong and toyo kanetsu kk  the baggage handling contractor for malaysia s kuala lumpur international airport  accounted for and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
each of these customers is nearing completion of deployment of checked baggage explosives detection systems at their respective airports 
as a result  the company expects that its revenues from these customers will decrease and will become increasingly dependent upon sales of upgrades  replacement equipment and services 
the inability of the company to obtain orders from customers other than these would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
dependence on government regulation 
the company s sales of its explosives detection systems for use in airports has been and will continue to be dependent upon governmental initiatives to require or support the screening of baggage with advanced explosives detection systems 
substantially all of such systems have been installed at airports in countries in which the applicable governmental or regulatory authority overseeing the operations of the airport has mandated such screening 
such mandates are influenced by many factors outside of the control of the company  including political and budgetary concerns of governments  airlines and airports 
in the united states  the aviation security act of directed the faa to develop a standard for explosives detection systems and required airports in the united states to deploy systems meeting this standard by the standard adopted by the faa is more comprehensive than standards adopted in most other countries 
the faa first certified a computed tomography ct system in december however  as recommended by the gore commission s final report  issued in february  and as required by the federal aviation re authorization act of the re authorization act  this system must undergo further testing to resolve whether it can operate under realistic airport operating conditions  including processing baggage at required throughput rates 
to date  no system has demonstrated that it meets the faa standard under realistic airport operating conditions 
as a result  only a limited number of these systems have been deployed  primarily on a test basis  in the united states 
the company s systems do not meet the faa certification standard 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s systems will ever meet this or any other united states certification standard 
moreover  there can be no assurance that additional countries will mandate the implementation of effective explosives screening of airline baggage  or that  if mandated  the company s systems will meet the certification or other requirements of the applicable governmental authority 
see item business regulation 
in october  the united states enacted the re authorization act  which included an allocation for the purchase of explosives detection systems and other advanced security equipment by air carriers and airport authorities 
utilizing this allocation  the faa has ordered initial quantities of the ct based system  trace detection systems and dual energy x ray based systems  including eight systems from the company 
deployment of these various systems is not scheduled for completion until mid there can be no assurance that the faa will order additional systems from the company 
see item business industry background 
developing market  uncertainty of market acceptance 
the explosives detection system market is at a relatively early stage of development 
acceptance of explosives detection systems on a broad basis will be dependent upon the acceptance and adoption of explosives detection systems by airlines and airports throughout the world  the expansion of applications for explosives detection technology  government initiatives to support the expansion of this market  the performance and price of the company s and its competitors products  customer reaction to those products and continued cost and performance improvements in explosives detection technology 
there can be no assurance that the explosives detection market will develop further or that the company will be successful in marketing its products effectively and obtaining broader market acceptance for its products 
failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
further  if one of the company s or a competitor s systems were to fail to detect explosives and such failure resulted in an airline bombing  the ability of the company to market its products could be materially adversely affected 
see item business industry background 
significant fluctuations and unpredictability of operating results 
significant annual and quarterly fluctuations in the company s results of operations may be caused by several factors  including the overall demand for explosives detection systems  market acceptance of the company s products  the timing of regulatory approvals for the company s system and government initiatives to promote the use of explosives detection systems such as those manufactured and sold by the company 
other factors that may cause fluctuations in operating results include the timing of the announcement  introduction and delivery of new products and product enhancements by the company and its competitors  variations in the company s product mix and component costs  timing of customer orders  adjustments of delivery schedules to accommodate customers programs  the availability of materials and labor necessary to produce the company s products  the availability of components from suppliers  the timing and level of expenditures in anticipation of future sales  and pricing and other competitive conditions 
customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments and production difficulties could delay shipments 
relatively few system sales to relatively few customers comprise a significant portion of the company s revenues in each quarter 
therefore  small variations in the number of systems sold could have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
lengthy sales cycle 
as a result of the significant capital and other commitments required to install and integrate the company s products into an airport baggage handling system  foreign regulatory approval requirements  and the developing nature of the explosives detection market  the company has experienced extended sales cycles with its customers 
the company s sales efforts with certain existing and potential customers have extended over several years 
customers may initially purchase one or a few units for extensive testing and evaluation before making a decision regarding volume purchases and  in certain circumstances  the company may provide a potential customer with a demonstration unit for regulatory testing and evaluation free of charge 
delays in anticipated purchase orders could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
see risk factors significant fluctuations and unpredictability of operating results and item business marketing and sales 
reliance on international sales 
in fiscal  and  international sales accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of the company s revenues 
risks associated with international sales include  among other things  international regulatory requirements and policy changes  political and economic instability  possible foreign currency controls  intellectual property protection  currency exchange rate fluctuations  tariffs or other barriers  staffing and management of foreign operations  inventory management  accounts receivable collection and the management of distributors or representatives 
in particular  recent economic instability in the asia pacific region may delay or reduce airport capital projects in that region which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  most foreign countries have their own regulatory approval requirements for sales of the company s products 
as a result  the company s introduction of new products into international markets can be costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
furthermore  the company s international sales have been denominated primarily in united states dollars 
the company anticipates that its international sales may increasingly be denominated in foreign currencies 
the company on occasion has hedged its foreign currency exposure by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that these hedging efforts will be successful or that other risks associated with international sales and operations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item business marketing and sales 
uncertainty of product development 
the company s success will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products  and to develop new products to meet regulatory and customer requirements and to achieve market acceptance 
the enhancement and development of these products will be subject to all of the risks associated with new product development  including unanticipated delays  expenses  technical problems or other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the commercialization of these enhancements or new products 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in introducing products or product enhancements  including products that meet faa certification standards  on a timely basis  if at all  or that the company will be able to market successfully these products and product enhancements once developed 
rapid technological change 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements 
the company believes that its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to successfully develop new products that meet regulatory and customer requirements and gain market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will not be rendered obsolete by new industry standards or changing technology 
competition 
the markets for the company s products are highly competitive 
the company s systems compete against dual energy x ray as well as other competing technologies  including ct and trace detection 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater manufacturing  marketing and financial resources than the company 
in addition  other major corporations have recently announced their intention to enter the security screening market and currently have systems in development 
one of the company s competitors has developed a product based upon ct scanner technology that was certified by the faa 
however  as recommended by the gore commission s final report and as required by the re authorization act  this system must undergo further testing to resolve whether it can operate under realistic airport operating conditions 
the company is aware of a new ct based system currently in development by another company that is purported to have a higher throughput than the faa certified ct system 
none of the company s products have been certified by the faa 
competitors may develop superior products or products of similar quality for sale at the same or lower prices 
other technical innovations may impair the company s ability to market its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
see item business competition 
limited protection of intellectual property rights  patent litigation 
the company s success depends significantly upon proprietary technology 
the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish  maintain and protect its proprietary rights  all of which afford only limited protection 
the company has obtained three patents and has pending three patent applications in the united states two of which have been allowed but have not yet been issued 
in addition  for certain foreign countries the company has pending patent applications that correspond to the subject matter of certain united states patents and patent applications 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s unallowed patent applications will be granted  that any patent or patent application will provide significant protection for the company s products and technology  or that the company s current or future products  processes or technology will not be challenged under patents held by competitors or potential competitors 
moreover  there can be no assurance that foreign intellectual property laws will protect the company s intellectual property rights 
in the absence of significant patent protection  the company may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy the company s products  processes or technology 
the company has an exclusive perpetual license to use certain patent rights and technology developed by hologic for the development  manufacture and sale of x ray screening security systems for explosives  drugs  currency and other contraband subject to termination by either party for certain defined defaults 
the company also has a nonexclusive license to use this technology for the development  manufacture and sale of x ray based products for process control applications in the food and beverage industries 
if the company desires to develop products for other applications  it must either use alternative technology or obtain an additional license from hologic 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to develop or license alternative technology for any additional applications  or that the company would be able to license hologic s technology for these applications on favorable terms  if at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that hologic will not develop or license its technology to others for applications competitive with those that may be developed by the company outside of areas for which the company has an exclusive license 
see item certain relationships and related transactions 
the company was involved in patent litigation with eg g astrophysics research corporation eg g  in which each party claimed that the other was infringing certain patents held by the other 
on november   the company and eg g signed a settlement agreement pursuant to which  among other things  each party agreed not to sue the other for patent infringement for nonmedical uses of x ray technology covered by each other s existing patents or by patent applications which claim priority from such patents  or  for products existing as of september   covered by patents that may be issued pursuant to existing patent applications 
as a result  each party will have broad rights to use the other s existing x ray technology for an unlimited period of time 
there can be no assurance that eg g will not use the company s technology in a manner that would materially and adversely affect the company s business and financial condition 
see item business intellectual property 
in may  the company commenced an action in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against as e seeking a declaration that the company does not infringe as e patents related to back scattered x rays 
this followed as e s allegations of infringement to third parties 
no discovery has been taken to date 
following a court decision in july construing the claims of the as e patent  which decision the company considers favorable  in september the company filed a motion for summary judgment of non infringement 
as e has not yet filed its papers in opposition to the company s motion but is seeking discovery 
if granted  the company s motion will resolve all issues remaining in the case in favor of the company 
earlier  in april  the court dismissed as e s proposed counterclaim seeking to allege patent infringement  so that the only remaining issue in the case is the company s request for declaration of non infringement of two claims of a single as e patent 
although the company does not believe that it is infringing any valid patent of as e  there can be no assurance that as e will not make a new counterclaim in which it raises more specific infringement allegations 
failure of the company to prevail in this litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
see item business intellectual property and item legal proceedings 
management of growth 
the company has undergone a period of growth  and any continued expansion may significantly strain the company s management  financial and other resources 
due to the level of technical and marketing expertise necessary to support its existing and new customers  the company must attract and retain highly qualified and well trained personnel 
there are a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions  and it may become increasingly difficult for the company to hire such personnel 
the company s expansion may also significantly strain the company s management  manufacturing  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures  and controls will be adequate to support the company s operations or that the company will be able to successfully integrate its new personnel 
failure to manage the company s growth properly could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
see item business executive officers of the registrant 
risks associated with possible acquisitions 
the company intends to pursue potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that could complement or expand the company s business 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify any appropriate acquisition candidate 
if the company identifies an acquisition candidate  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to successfully negotiate the terms of any such acquisition  finance such acquisition or integrate such acquired business  products or technologies into the company s existing business and products 
furthermore  the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of an acquired business could cause diversion of management s time and resources  and require the company to use working capital to consummate a potential acquisition 
there can be no assurance that a given acquisition  whether or not consummated  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial condition 
if the company consummates one or more significant acquisitions in which consideration consists of common stock  stockholders of the company could suffer significant dilution of their interests in the company 
see risk factors management of growth 
potential for product liability claims 
the company s business involves the risk of product liability claims inherent to the explosives detection industry 
there are many factors beyond the control of the company that could result in the failure of the company s products to detect explosives  such as the reliability of a customer s operators  the ongoing training of such operators and the maintenance of the company s products by its customers 
for these and other reasons  there can be no assurance that the company s products will detect all explosives concealed in screened bags 
the failure to detect an explosive could give rise to product liability claims and result in negative publicity that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
the company currently maintains aviation product liability insurance with an aggregate coverage limit of million per year  subject to certain deductibles and exclusions 
there can be no assurance that this insurance will be sufficient to protect the company from product liability claims  or that product liability insurance will continue to be available to the company at a reasonable cost  if at all 
concentration of ownership  control by management 
as of december   the company s executive officers  directors and their affiliates and members of their immediate families beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock  excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options and warrants 
as a result  these stockholders  if acting together  will be able to exert substantial influence over actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors  amendments to the company s restated certificate of incorporation  mergers  sales of assets or other business acquisitions or dispositions 
antitakeover provisions 
the company s restated certificate of incorporation contains certain provisions that may discourage bids for the company 
this could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the common stock
