the company s actual results could differ materially 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report 
overview since its inception in february  the company has devoted substantially all of its resources to the discovery and development of neuropharmaceutical products for the treatment of disorders affecting the brain 
the company has incurred losses since inception and expects losses to continue for the foreseeable future  primarily due to the expansion of programs for research and development 
operating results are expected to fluctuate as a result of uncertainty in the timing and amount of expenses for product development and in the timing and amount of revenues to be earned from the achievement of research and development milestones  promotion of partners products and sales of company products  if any 
as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and revenues in connection with the company s promotion agreements  co promotion revenues of million were realized for the year ended december   compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily related to the declining market for the products under a promotion agreement with novartis formerly ciba geigy 
this decrease was partially offset by the recognition in of million of revenues from novartis related to and co promotion activities 
the promotion agreement with novartis was concluded on december   and there will be no further co promotion activity under the agreement 
in addition  in the company realized co promotion revenues from the parke davis promotion agreement which began in october  and the somerset promotion agreement which began in january in connection with its development agreements  the company realized million in co development revenues for the year ended december   compared to million in the increase is primarily attributable to the one time license fee of million received in pursuant to the searle development and commercialization agreement 
no co development revenues were realized prior to expenses research and development expenses increased to million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase each year resulted from the continuing progress of the company s products in clinical development  the discovery of new compounds  the preclinical development of lead candidates and the activities needed to support these programs 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in is primarily attributable to one time charges related to termination agreements with certain former company executives 
the majority of these charges were non cash and resulted from the extension of certain stock options 
increases from year to year also reflected higher administrative staffing levels and related expenses required to support increased research and development activities and the commencement of sales operations in august in  the company recorded a one time  non cash charge of million for acquired research and development expenses relating to the acquisition of acea pharmaceuticals  inc acea 
an additional charge of million was incurred to expense amounts advanced to acea prior to the acquisition 
interest income and expense interest income totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the increases each year were due to higher cash and short term investment balances 
interest expense decreased to  in  compared to  in and  in the decrease in each period was attributable to lower capital lease obligations used to finance equipment 
liquidity and capital resources from its inception in february through december   the company has financed its operations primarily through private and public offerings of its equity securities  raising net proceeds of approximately million through sales of these securities 
at december   the company s balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  compared to million at december  as of december   the company had invested million in leasehold improvements  laboratory and computer equipment and office furnishings and equipment 
the company has financed million of these capital additions through capital lease lines 
in addition  the company leases its laboratory and office facilities under operating leases 
while additional equipment will be needed as the company increases its research and development activities  the company has no material commitments for the acquisition of property and equipment 
pursuant to the novartis r d agreement  novartis is obligated to pay one half of the development costs of acea for the united states market and all incremental development costs for the rest of the world  along with additional payments upon the achievement of certain milestones 
these payments are recognized by the company as co development revenues 
under this agreement  novartis also purchased million of cocensys common stock 
repayment of amounts advanced will be secured by future milestone payments 
pursuant to the parke davis promotion agreement  the company promotes parke davis cns drug  cognex  to neurologists in the united states 
funds are advanced to the company quarterly to cover the training and operating expenses incurred by the company s sales force in promoting cognex 
the company is obligated to reimburse parke davis for these advances 
cocensys will recognize co promotion revenues from its share of sales of cognex above certain base levels specified in the contract 
pursuant to the warner collaboration agreement  warner lambert is also obligated to make certain milestone payments for each compound selected for development  as well as pay for its share of development costs 
these payments will be recognized by the company as co development revenues 
also pursuant to this agreement  warner lambert purchased million of cocensys common stock in october and an additional million of cocensys common stock in march pursuant to the somerset promotion agreement  the company promotes somerset s drug eldepryl to neurologists in the united states 
funds are advanced to the company quarterly to cover a portion of the training and operating expenses incurred by the company s sales force in promoting eldepryl 
the company is obligated to reimburse somerset for these advances 
cocensys will recognize co promotion revenues from compensation received from somerset  which is based upon the number of details undertaken  new prescriptions written and sales 
pursuant to the searle development and commercialization agreement  both companies are obligated to pay a portion of the development costs of ccd and its back up compounds for the us market 
the company will receive nonrefundable milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain events in the development of the compound 
in addition  searle purchased  shares of the company s series b convertible preferred stock for million 
cocensys operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash 
the negative cash flow from operations is expected to continue and will likely increase over the foreseeable future  subject to the company s ability to mitigate such negative cash flows with revenues  if any  derived from the sale of products from current and potential future marketing collaborations 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources  including funding expected to be available through current partner collaborations including milestone payments and co promotion revenues  will be adequate to satisfy its capital needs for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance that milestone based payments or co promotion revenues will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements 
the company will need to obtain substantial additional funds to conduct the costly and time consuming research  preclinical development and clinical trials necessary to bring its products to market 
the company intends to seek additional funding through additional research and development collaborations with suitable corporate partners  through additional marketing collaborations to increase revenues generated from sales of products and or through public or private financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financings or suitable collaborations will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
insufficient funds may require the company to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of its research and product development programs or to license third parties to commercialize products or technologies that the company would otherwise seek to develop itself 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress of the company s research and development programs  the level of co promotion revenues  the scope and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the rate of technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of the company s products under development  the status of competitive products  the expansion of sales and marketing capabilities  the establishment of third party manufacturing arrangements and the establishment of additional collaborative relationships
