exchange rates the company receives united states dollars for substantially all of its product sales and its licensing revenues

during the last three fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s inventory costs  however  due to the number of currencies involved and the fact that not all foreign currencies react in the same manner against the united states dollar  the company cannot quantify in any meaningful way the potential effect of such fluctuations on future income 
the company does not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risk
