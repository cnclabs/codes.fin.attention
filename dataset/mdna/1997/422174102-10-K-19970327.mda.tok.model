speiser  the company s chairman of the board and president  and robert d

pursuant to employment agreements entered into in april  in november the company caused transderm to issue an option to purchase shares of transderm s common stock at an exercise price of

speiser and robert d 
speiser

the synthetic fabrics sales increase is due principally to higher industrial fabrics sales which includes increased governmental and agricultural sales 
environmental products sales increased due primarily to several new insect mating disruptant products introduced in early sales of transdermal nitroglycerin patches manufactured and marketed by hercon laboratories decreased due primarily to lower sales to a former domestic distributor of the company  which in august obtained approval from the united states food and drug administration for the manufacture and sale of its own nitroglycerin patches

million 
accounts payable increases were due primarily to billings for legal fees related to the defense of hercon laboratories in its litigation with key key litigation and raw materials related to increased synthetic fabric sales 
inventory decreased million primarily due to improvements made to the material management system at herculite and efforts to lower inventory levels at both herculite and pacific
