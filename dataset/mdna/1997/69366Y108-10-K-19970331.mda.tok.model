outlook 
the statements contained in this outlook section are based on managements current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
the company expects the demand for plastic pipe and tubing to grow as acceptance of plastic pipe over metal pipe continues and the overall economy continues to grow 
industry growth projections call for annual sales growth rates for plastic pipe and tubing of four percent or greater per year through the company has historically been able  and expects in the future  to grow at rates substantially in excess of the industry averages due to its emphasis on customer satisfaction  product quality and differentiation and inovative promotional programs 
the company s strategy has been  and continues to be  to concentrate growth in the higher profit products and geographic regions 
to fully implement its growth strategy  the company will be required to look to external sources to fund future capital expenditures and or acquisitions 
the company expects to spend approximately million for capital additions in  as the company continues its efforts to increase capacities at all three manufacturing facilities to meet current and future demands 
if the company is unable to obtain the external funding needed  growth will be confined to a level that can be supported by internally generated capital 
the company s gross margin percentage is a sensitive function of pvc and pe raw material resin prices 
in a rising or stable market  margins and sales volume have historically been higher and conversely  in falling markets sales volumes and margins have historically been lower 
due to the commodity nature of pvc and pe resin and the dynamic supply and demand factors worldwide  it is very dificult to predict gross margin percentages or assume that historical trends will continue 
the company s net operating loss carryforwards nols are available through the year  however  the majority expire by the year the actual amount of available nols which will be utilized is dependent on future profits and based on current projections  it appears that a portion of the nols which expire in will not be fully utilized 
the company s future results of operations and the other forward looking statements contained in this outlook section  in particular the statements regarding growth in the plastic pipe industry  capital spending and resin prices  involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
in addition to the factors discussed above  the other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following business conditions and the general economy  competitive factors  such as major capacity increases from competition  and weather factors 
the company believes that it has the product offerings  facilities  personnel  and competitive and financial resources for continued business success  but future revenues  costs  margins  and profits are all influenced by a number of factors  as discussed above
