item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general smith micro was founded in march to design and market financial software 
in the mid s  the company shifted its focus to communication software for modem manufacturers 
the company shipped its first data communication software product in and  since that time  the company s growth in revenues has been the result of the market acceptance of its oem data and fax communication software products 
the company recognizes revenues from sales of its software as completed products are shipped and from royalties from customers who are authorized to duplicate the company s software 
any material reduction in demand for the company s products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has continued to expand its business by introducing new products and its future success will depend in part on the continued introduction of new and enhanced oem and retail products that achieve market acceptance 
revenues are net of estimated returns and other adjustments at the time the products are shipped 
the company has allowed its customers to return unused software  constituting  and of the company s net revenues for  and  respectively 
from november  through september  the closing date of the company s initial public offering  the company elected to be treated as an s corporation for federal income tax purposes 
as a consequence  the company generally did not have  during this period  an income tax liability and the company s earnings have been treated as being distributed to the existing stockholders for income tax reporting purposes 
a small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the company s revenues 
sales to us robotics including  for  sales to megahertz which us robotics acquired in february  in particular  which became a customer in the fourth quarter of  accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues for   and  respectively 
during   and the company s three largest oem customers  including us robotics  accounted for   and  respectively  of net revenues 
during   and the company s net revenues form the three largest retail customers accounted for  and  respectively  of net revenues 
any reduction  delay or change in orders from such customers could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in april  the company entered into an oem agreement having an initial one year term with us robotics access corp  one of several wholly owned subsidiaries of us robotics corporation which agreement superseded the previous agreement between the parties 
the new agreement renews automatically at the end of each one year term unless either party provides at least days notice of its intention to terminate the agreement at the end of the then current term 
under the terms of the agreement  the company granted certain pricing incentives to us robotics access corp 
in consideration for which the company became the exclusive provider of fax  data  voice and telephony communications software for certain us robotics modems 
in addition  under the terms of the agreement  us robotics access corp 
has agreed to place smith micro retail products and commercials for such products on certain us robotics compact disks 
moreover  the agreement does not require us robotics access corp 
or any other us robotics affiliated entity to purchase any minimum quantity of smith micro products and may be terminated by either party at any time for any reason upon days written notice 
as a result  there can be no assurance that us robotics will continue to purchase the company s products 
while the company believes that it has been the principal supplier of oem communication software products to us robotics excluding megahertz  there can be no assurance that us robotics will not seek additional sources for such products in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that sales to us robotics will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 
a substantial decrease or delay in sales to us robotics would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
assuming the number of products sold to us robotics access corp 
were to remain at levels  in light of the pricing incentives provided in the agreement  gross revenues from us robotics with respect to products covered by the agreement could be adversely affected  although the company believes that net income attributable to such sales would not be impacted negatively 
during february  com announced its intent to acquire us robotics 
upon completion  there can be no assurance that the acquisition will not result in a change in the resulting entity s purchasing habits  a decrease in orders  or delays in orders previously made by us robotics  or the loss of that customer entirely 
the company entered into an agreement having an initial one year term with motorola in january to provide retail and oem products to motorola s pcmcia division and information systems group 
this agreement is automatically renewable for consecutive one year terms  but either party may terminate the agreement at the end of the then current term by providing days notice to the other party 
moreover  as with the us robotics access corp 
agreement  the motorola agreement does not require motorola to purchase any minimum quantity of smith micro products and  as a result  there can be no assurance that motorola will order any additional products or that it will develop into a substantial customer of the company 
the oem product ordering cycle beginning from placement of an order to shipping is very short 
oem customers generally operate under a just in time system and order software to be delivered as needed by their manufacturing operations 
the company s products are generally shipped as orders are received and  accordingly  the company has historically operated with little backlog  and does not consider backlog to be a significant indication of future performance 
as a result  sales in any quarter are dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and are not predictable with any degree of certainty 
moreover  the company does not generally produce software in advance of orders and therefore has not maintained a material amount of inventory 
on march   the company acquired performance computing incorporated 
in connection with the acquisition  all of the outstanding pci shares were converted into the right to receive an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock  valued at  and  in cash with an additional  payable to the seller group or at its direction contingent on the achievement of certain milestones 
such amount was accrued as a part of the purchase price  all of the milestones have subsequently been met and the entire amount was paid subsequent to year end 
the company also incurred direct costs of approximately  related to the acquisition 
the company obtained an independent valuation of the net assets acquired in the purchase transaction which resulted in the allocation of the purchase price to  of identified assets   of liabilities and  of in process research and development 
as the technological feasibility of the in process research and development had not been established and such technology had no alternative future use  the acquired in process research and development was expensed in accordance with interpretation of apb opinion no
