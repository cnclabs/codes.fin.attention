item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general since  the company s primary focus has been exploratory drilling through the use of three dimensional seismic technology 
the company s long term business strategy is to increase the company s reserve base by utilizing d seismic technology 
the company intends to exploit its existing properties and acquire those properties which it believes can be exploited by developing reserves not previously produced 
the company undertakes projects only when it believes the project has the potential for initial cash flow adequate to return the project s capital expenditures within a short period of time  generally less than months 
the company also endeavors to maximize the present value of its projects by accelerating production of its reserves consistent with prudent reservoir management 
as part of this business strategy  the company has acquired oil and gas producing properties in the permian basin of west texas and has discovered oil and gas reserves through the use of d seismic technology in the horseshoe atoll reef trend of west texas and the yegua frio gas trend onshore the gulf coast of texas 
capital utilized to acquire such reserves has been provided primarily by secured bank financing  sales of the company s equity securities and cash flow from operations 
the company s oil and gas producing activities are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
accordingly  the company capitalizes all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of oil and gas properties and with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves 
normal dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized 
certain directly identifiable internal costs of property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
such costs capitalized in  and totaled approximately   and  respectively 
depletion of such costs is provided using the units of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and gas reserves with oil and gas production being converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content 
depletion per equivalent unit of production ebo was  and for  and  respectively 
costs from unproved properties are excluded from depletion until evaluated 
in accordance with the full cost method of accounting  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties full cost ceiling limitation are not to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at  and lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties  net of tax considerations 
results of operations the company s business activities are characterized by frequent  and sometimes significant  changes in reserve base  sources of production  product mix gas versus oil volumes and prices received by the company for its gas and oil 
consequently  year to year or other periodic comparisons of the company s results of operations can be difficult and may not fully and accurately describe the company s condition

pretax income income tax expense net income years ended december  and december  oil and gas revenues 
oil and gas revenues increased million  or to million or the twelve months ended december   from million for the same period of the increase was primarily the result of a  ebo  or increase to  ebo in the company s oil and gas production  and an increase of in the average sales price per ebo from in the twelve months ended december  to for the same period of of the million increase in revenues  million was attributable to increased oil and gas production volume and million was attributable to the increase in average sales prices  primarily gas prices 
of the increase in revenues  approximately million  or approximately was due to production from the yegua frio gas trend properties which were drilled  completed and began production during production costs 
production costs increased million or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the same period of the increase in production of  ebo was responsible for the increase in production costs 
production costs as a percentage of revenues declined primarily because of the increase in the average sales price per ebo 
additionally  average production costs per ebo declined to for the twelve months ended december  compared to in the same period of as a result of new production from the company s yegua frio wells 
at december   substantially all of the company s oil wells employed artificial lift pumping and have higher associated production costs than its gas wells  which flow 
as a result of its successful drilling efforts in the yegua frio gas trend during  the company s production became more weighted toward gas production 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of as a result of the company s low administrative cost structure and the increase in revenues  the company s general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from for the year ended december  to for the same period in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense increased million  or to million in the year ended december   from million for the same period of the decrease in depletion  depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues is primarily a result of the increase in prices realized per ebo  partially offset by an increase in the dd a rate to in the year ended december  from in the increase in the dd a rate is attributable to increased exploration and drilling activities 
during  the company added million ebo to its reserve base  net of  ebo of production  an increase of to its net reserves 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses increased per ebo  reflecting the company s success in drilling activities 
net interest expense 
interest expense increased  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period of  due principally to increased borrowings under the company s revolving loan agreement  offset partially by a decrease in interest rates

net income and operating cash flow 
net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  operating cash flow increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the net income and operating cash flow increases are primarily due to the increase in oil and gas revenues and  due to the company s low administrative cost structure  and costs not increasing in proportion to the increase in revenues 
years ended december  and december  oil and gas revenues 
oil and gas revenues increased  in  compared to the increase was the result of a increase in oil and gas production from  ebo to  ebo  offset by a decrease of in the average sales price per ebo from in to in production costs 
production costs increased  or  to million in compared to million in while the average sales price per ebo  which was slightly lower in  accounted for the small increase in production costs as a percentage of revenues  average production costs per ebo were slightly lower at in compared to in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  in from  in substantially all of this increase was attributable to the increase in staff of one employee and overall increases in general corporate expenses 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased approximately  or 
the increase was due to a increase in production volumes sold in and the decline in the dd a rate per ebo to in from in net interest expense 
interest expense increased  or  to million in  compared to  in  due primarily to increased borrowings under the company s revolving loan agreement 
income tax expense 
the company had an effective tax rate that approximates the statutory rate for both and net income and operating cash flow 
net income decreased  to  in compared to  in and operating cash flow from operations  before working capital adjustments  decreased  or  to million in compared to million in liquidity and capital resources working capital decreased  as of december  compared to december  current assets exceeded current liabilities by  at december  compared to  at december  current assets increased primarily due to a decrease in undeveloped leases held for sale of  offset by an increase of million in accounts receivable 
current liabilities increased because of an increase in accounts payables of million  resulting from the company s increased drilling activities 
on july   the company entered into its revolving loan agreement  maturing july   with bank one  texas  na  to refinance the outstanding indebtedness under its loan agreement with its former bank lender and to provide funds for working capital 
the company may borrow up to the lesser of million or the borrowing base in effect from time to time 
the borrowing base is redetermined by the bank semi annually on or about april and october of each year  or at such other times as the bank elects 
on december   the company consummated the sale of  shares of its common stock pursuant to a public offering  and on january   an additional  shares were sold upon exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
the net proceeds from the sale of the  shares of common stock approximately million were used to reduce the company s outstanding bank debt 
at december   the borrowing base and outstanding bank debt were million and approximately million  respectively 
the company incurred costs of million in its oil and gas property acquisition and development activities for the year ended december  such costs were financed by the utilization of working capital in addition to the sale of selected properties for  net cash provided by operating activities of million and net cash provided by financing activities of million  which was attributable to a net decrease in bank borrowings in the amount of million and net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of  shares of common stock 
the oil and gas industry is capital intensive 
the company s cash flow from operations and the continued availability of credit to it are subject to a number of variables  including the company s proved reserves and proved developed reserves  the level of oil and gas the company is able to produce from existing wells  the prices at which oil and gas are sold and the company s ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves  each of which can materially affect the borrowing base availability under the company s revolving loan agreement  its only credit facility 
the company may from time to time seek additional financing  either in the form of increased bank borrowings  sales of the company s securities or other forms of financing 
except for the company s revolving loan agreement  the company has no agreements for any such financing and there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing 
trends and prices the company s revenues  cash flows and borrowing capacity are affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
the markets for oil and gas have historically been  and will continue to be  volatile 
prices for oil and gas typically fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty  seasonal  political and other factors beyond the control of the company 
the company is unable to accurately predict domestic or worldwide political events or the effects of such other factors on the prices received by the company for its oil and gas 
the company historically has not entered into transactions to hedge against changes in oil and gas prices  but may elect to enter into hedging transactions in the future to protect against fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
during  the average sales price received by the company for its oil was approximately per bbl  as compared to in  while the average sales prices for the company s gas was approximately per mcf in  as compared to per mcf in at march   the price received by the company for its oil production was approximately per bbl  while the price received by the company  at that same date  for its gas production was approximately per mcf
