extraordinary loss in july  the company redeemed all of its outstanding subordinated notes due at a price of of par 
the principal amount redeemed was  and the redemption resulted in an extraordinary loss of  net of income taxes of  inflation inflation has a long term effect on the company because increasing costs of land  materials and labor result in increasing sales prices of its homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the company s housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of the company s homes 
a significant inflationary risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising housing costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
in recent years  in the price ranges in which it sells homes  the company has not found this risk to be a significant problem 
inflation has a lesser short term effect on the company because the company generally negotiates fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of its homes 
these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between four to twelve months 
construction costs for residential buildings represent approximately of the company s total costs and expenses
