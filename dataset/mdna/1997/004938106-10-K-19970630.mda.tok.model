factors affecting future operating results certain statements contained herein are dependent upon numerous factors  circumstances and contingencies 
the following factors  while not all inclusive  could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated competitive pressure from new entrants to the cti market  including large software companies and telephone switch manufacturers with greater resources  could adversely affect the company s business 
increasing price competition in the company s marketplace could influence the timing and amount of change in the company s prices to its customers  and therefore significantly influence the company s operating position 
if the company experiences delays in shipments whether it is due to delays from customers or as a result of the timing of new product introductions by the company in a given quarter  or if new order bookings do not meet anticipated levels  substantial fluctuations in operating results will occur 
frequently  these developments may not become apparent to the company until near or at the end of the quarter 
in addition  changes in the product and channel mix  and the timing of customer orders  will continue to affect the variability of quarterly results of operations in future quarters 
gross margins may continue to decline as a result of price competition and may either increase or decrease as a result of further shifts in product mix depending upon the percentage of net sales contributed by software only sales in comparison to turnkey system sales 
dependence on continued sales to significant customers could have a significant impact on the company s operations as there is no assurance that any particular customer will continue to purchase similar volumes of the company s products 
risks associated with the company s movement into the larger end user market  such as product acceptance and demand and failure to attract sufficient market share  could affect the company s future performance 
introduction of new products by the company or its competitors and the extent of their success or failure could produce significant fluctuations in market demand for the company s products 
the extent and timing of new product development and the need or desire to modify existing products may cause notable increases in research and development spending 
growth strategies involving acquisitions and strategic relationships may encounter legal and or unforeseeable delays beyond the company s control 
risks associated with foreign operations such as gains and losses on the conversion of foreign currencies to us dollars may significantly affect the company s operating results 
increasing international sales may require notable increases in development spending associated with localization of products
