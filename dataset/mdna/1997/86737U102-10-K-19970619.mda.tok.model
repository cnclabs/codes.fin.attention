krug life sciences inc 
houston operations krug life sciences has been conducting  pursuant to contracts with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa  biomedical research  technology development  and flight crew operations support at nasa s lyndon b 
johnson space center continuously since from the original work of developing specialized cardiovascular monitoring instrumentation  the research and development activities have expanded to encompass certain additional scientific activities relating to man s capability and capacity to explore and exploit the frontiers of space 
such activities include the conceptualization and implementation of groundbased and in flight medical experiments to develop the health care and physiological deconditioning countermeasures required to offset the microgravity of space and ensure the well being and productivity of the flight crews 
performance under such contracts includes the areas of neurosensory physiology  cardiovascular physiology  musculoskeletal physiology  regulatory systems physiology  electrophysiology  cell biology  biochemistry  pharmacodynamics  remote health care  bioengineering  applications of knowledge based systems and clinical laboratory operations 
krug s work for the johnson space center is spread over a wide variety of agency programs  none of which comprise more than of the aggregate contracts 
some of the major areas of work include support of shuttle flights and the joint russian mir space ventures  shuttle extended duration mission research  manned flight research and development  space station research and biotechnology research 
in march  krug life sciences began work on a million  five year contract with nasa  replacing the one which previously started in january this contract expanded the support services provided to the medical sciences division at the johnson space center 
in april  nasa modified the contract and increased its value to million 
this modification covered the cost of additional test equipment  supplies and services for the remaining three years of the contract 
in february  this contract was extended for a nine month period to november  and has been further extended in connection with the rebid and sole source awards of various portions of the contract work 
on january   krug life sciences won the rebid of the medical support and integration portion of its work for nasa and signed a new contract with an expected value of approximately million over five years  including million for years four and five  which may be awarded at the option of nasa 
on january   krug life sciences was awarded by nasa  on a sole source basis  a million contract for the continuation of the design  development  test and evaluation of flight hardware for the shuttle and space station through december  in june  krug life sciences submitted its bid for a five year biotechnology processing contract covering certain work it presently performs 
nasa has indicated that it will award a contract for such work to krug life sciences on a sole source basis effective july   however  until a contract is executed  there can be no assurance that such award will be forthcoming or as to the scope  term or amount of such work 
krug life sciences inc 
san antonio operations krug life sciences also provides professional research support services to the united states air force usaf under a contract which expires in november and is presently being rebid 
such services include research into human tolerance to gravitational forces generated by rapid onset and increasing acceleration 
as advances in aircraft development lead to increases in speed and mobility  this research becomes increasingly more important 
engineering programs include the design and production of variable profile breathing simulators  therapeutic oxygen manifold systems and other similar devices 
krug life sciences also does repair  maintenance and calibration of sophisticated ground and airborne electronics equipment  and has provided such services on a limited basis to commercial customers in the san antonio area 
the backlog remaining on the usaf contract at march  was approximately million 
technology scientific services  inc 
technology scientific services provides a wide variety of engineering and technical support services in various on site governmental research and experimental programs under contracts with the us air force which expire from september through september current activities are principally in support of laboratories at wright patterson air force base and involve computer networking using fiber optics  satellite communications  aircraft structural and environmental testing  microelectronics  fabrication techniques for composite materials and aircraft vulnerability investigations 
in august  technology scientific services was awarded a new contract for equipment calibration at the wright laboratory  wright patterson air force base 
the contract consists of a base period beginning august  plus four one year options through september  the contract value with the options is approximately million 
general and outlook in its life sciences and engineering segment  the corporation competes with practically all the large and small aerospace companies  including small local companies competing for services contracts 
the areas of competition vary from contract to contract but most contracts are price sensitive 
some business has been obtained on a sole source basis  such as follow on business  where a unique capability or product has been developed and the limited market precludes the development of a second source by the government 
the majority of the corporation s life sciences and engineering business is with agencies of the us government and prime government contractors and  as a result  is subject to possible termination for the convenience of the government 
the order backlog of the life sciences and engineering segment was million at march  and million at march  approximately of the backlog at march  is expected to result in revenue during fiscal further information relating to the corporation s ls e segment contracts is included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the current economic forces at work in the government services market  including government budgetary limitations and increased competition for government contracts  have caused a number of companies to enter into business combinations and activities designed to make them larger  stronger and more competitive  and that to maintain its competitiveness in the areas in which it holds contracts  krug life sciences needs to be part of such a larger organization 
in april   the corporation engaged quarterdeck investment partners  inc  an investment bank which provides advisory services to aerospace  defense and information technology companies  to assist in evaluating strategic alternatives concerning the ls e segment 
leisure marine sowester limited sowester  a subsidiary of krug international uk ltd  is engaged in the leisure marine business

the marine products business is seasonal  with the highest sales occurring in spring and summer 
order backlog is not a factor in the leisure marine segment since virtually all orders are shipped within days of receipt 
outlook the leisure marine business conducted by sowester is specialized and requires substantial industry specific knowledge and skills 
management believes the leisure marine business in the uk and europe is moving toward a consolidation phase likely to be dominated by and rewarding larger companies 
such changes would likely affect the structural nature of marine distribution as conducted by sowester 
accordingly  management has taken steps to refocus sowester on growth opportunities and management objectives which it believes will be important in the future and  under appropriate circumstances  the corporation will consider a merger or other transaction if satisfied that the opportunity would enhance sowester s ability to adapt to future changes in the market
