certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
recent operating losses the company incurred losses from continuing operations during fiscal and  and there can be no assurance that the company will not continue to incur losses in the future 
continued net losses would affect the company s cash position and could require the company to reduce certain expenditures  including without limitation expenditures for advertising and inventory  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if the company continues to have net losses in the future  the company may be unable to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax asset discussed in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
available funds the company s future financial performance will also depend on its ability to purchase goods and services on credit and to borrow funds under its revolving credit agreement 
if the company is unable to purchase goods and services on credit or the company s lenders do not provide the company with favorable credit arrangements  the company may need to seek additional funds from other parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company would be able to obtain any such third party funding or obtain such funding on terms as favorable as those offered by its lenders 
also  in the event the company elects to raise additional funds through the sale of assets or securities or both  the company may not be able to complete such sales in a timely manner or on terms favorable to the company 
consumer spending the success of the company is influenced by a number of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates 
adverse changes in these economic conditions may restrict consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if consumer spending is lower than anticipated during the holiday season 
competition the markets in which the company is engaged are highly competitive 
nordictrack competes with several companies which design  manufacture and distribute physical fitness and exercise equipment  have greater financial resources and offer a greater selection of products 
during the past several years  nordictrack s competitors have introduced several new and competitive products at competitive prices which have adversely affected nordictrack s revenues and profits 
the future success of nordictrack depends in part upon its ability to introduce new and competitive products successfully  on a timely basis and at competitive prices 
the failure of nordictrack to successfully compete with its competitors could materially adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
many of the competitors of smith hawken are larger companies with greater financial resources  a greater selection of merchandise and nationwide distribution  including a large number and wide variety of specialty retail stores  discount stores and department stores 
smith hawken also competes with mail order catalogs that sell gardening related merchandise and independent garden stores and plant nurseries in towns and cities throughout the united states 
the failure of smith hawken to successfully compete with these companies could adversely affect the company s operating results 
new products several new and enhanced products were introduced by the company in fiscal and fiscal and a new line of elliptical products will be introduced in the fall of fiscal the company s future financial performance will depend on the continued market acceptance of the company s existing products and the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products 
if these products do not receive favorable market acceptance  the company s future operating results would be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products and marketing its existing or new products 
new management team the company has replaced a number of key executives at nordictrack 
there can be no assurance  however  that the new personnel will be able to successfully increase revenues or reduce costs at nordictrack in the future 
seasonality the company s businesses are seasonal  with significant amounts of retail sales in the second and third fiscal quarters 
the company expects this seasonality to continue in the future 
because of this seasonality  the company s revenues and earnings have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
advertising and marketing programs the company s success in the markets in which it competes depends in part upon the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs of the company and the company s ability to successfully manage its advertising in house 
the inability of the company to periodically design and successfully execute new and effective advertising and marketing programs could adversely affect the company s operating results 
cost reduction programs in fiscal and  the company was able to significantly reduce its operating costs as net sales decreased 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to further reduce operating costs if sales decline in the future 
in addition  postage expenses associated with mailing catalogs and shipping charges associated with acquiring and distributing products and merchandise to customers are significant factors in the operation of the company s businesses 
increases in postage or shipping costs  or disruptions in delivery and shipping services  could adversely affect the company s operating results 
intellectual property rights the company will continue to be subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future with respect to the company s current or future products or that any such claims will not require the company to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
while the company believes that it currently has all licenses necessary to conduct its business  no assurance can be given that additional licenses will not be required in the future 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that  if any additional licenses are required  such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
tax matters the internal revenue service irs has been engaged in an examination of the company s tax returns for the fiscal years through the irs has indicated that it intends to mail an official assessment notice shortly proposing certain adjustments which  if sustained by the irs  would result in a tax deficiency for the years under examination 
the adjustments proposed by the irs primarily relate to i the disallowance of deductions taken by the company with respect to incentive compensation payments of  made to the former owners of nordictrack acquired in june pursuant to their employment contracts  and ii incentive compensation payments made to the former owners of britches of georgetowne acquired in august and sold in april pursuant to the terms of an earnout agreement and the valuation of certain assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of britches of georgetowne in the amount of  the net federal tax due relating to the proposed adjustments approximates  excluding interest 
the incentive compensation payments to the former owners of nordictrack were attributable to substantial increases in sales and profits at nordictrack during the years under examination 
the company believes that the tax deductions taken were valid and in accordance with the internal revenue code and intends to vigorously oppose the proposed adjustments 
however  at this stage no assurance can be given of a favorable outcome on these matters 
if the irs proposed adjustments are sustained  any back taxes owed and associated interest would have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated operating results for the period in which such issues are finally resolved and would also have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition 
other inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operations 
the company is involved in various legal proceedings and claims and two former subsidiaries of the company are involved in two separate environmental matters

and will have on the consolidated financial statements
