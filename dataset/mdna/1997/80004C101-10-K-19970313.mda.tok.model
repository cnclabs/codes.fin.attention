item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements in this discussion and analysis are forward looking statements based on current expectations  and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties are set forth in item business risk factors 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
results of operations product revenues 
sandisk s product revenues grew in to million from million in the increase of million consisted of a increase in units shipped offset by a decline in average selling prices 
the increase in product revenues in was due to increased sales of the company s chipset  compactflash and flashdisk products 
fiscal year product revenues of million were higher than due to increased sales of flashdisk products 
during the fourth quarter of  the company experienced a shift in product mix to lower capacity mb compactflash cards which caused average selling prices to decline from the previous quarter 
as a result  product revenues declined in the fourth quarter even though unit shipments increased 
the company anticipates that lower capacity products will continue to represent a significant portion of its sales as consumer applications such as digital cameras become more popular 
sales of these lower capacity products generally have lower average selling prices and gross margins than higher capacity products 
the mix of products sold varies from quarter to quarter and may vary in the future  affecting the company s overall average selling prices and gross margins 
the company sells products to the industrial  communications  highly portable computing and consumer markets 
the mix of sales to these key markets varies from quarter to quarter and may vary in the future 
while sandisk has been successful winning design ins for many new applications  it generally takes several quarters for these new products to reach the market 
it is difficult to predict the timing of related new product introductions and future sales volumes from these design ins as the success of the products is uncertain 
as these markets develop  competition is expected to increase  which could cause average selling prices and gross margins to decline 
see item business risk factors competition 
order visibility weakened during the last half of the company also experienced a shift in its customer order profile 
the current glut and rapidly declining average selling prices that have afflicted the dram  sram and standard flash markets  coupled with the slower than expected growth in demand in the company s markets  has brought about an expectation of drop ship purchasing  with few or no long term purchase orders 
consequently  the turns component of the company s business is increasing 
sandisk s backlog at the end of shrank to million  the lowest level in two years 
if the company is unable to substantially increase its turns business  its results of operations will be materially adversely affected by this trend 
to adapt to these evolving market conditions  the company shifted to more in house manufacturing in the third quarter of to reduce costs and lead times and to position itself to respond quickly to changes in customer demand 
the current limited visibility of orders could continue indefinitely until the new markets addressed by the company s products enter a more predictable growth phase and demand begins to create longer lead times 
historically  a majority of the company s sales have been to a limited number of customers 
sales to the company s top ten customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s product revenues in  and the company expects that sales of its products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company has also experienced significant changes in the composition of its major customer base from year to year and expects this pattern to continue as market demand for such customers products fluctuates 
for example  during the fourth quarter of  the volume of large oem orders decreased due to the timing of customer s product introductions 
see item business risk factors customer concentration 
export sales continue to be an important part of the company s business representing and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the company invoices certain japanese customers in yen and is subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these transactions 
the company expects international sales to continue to constitute a significant portion of revenues

royalty revenues 
royalty revenues from patent cross license agreements were million in up from million in total revenues from patent licenses and royalties increased to of total revenues in  up from in in december  the company entered into a patent cross license agreement with sharp corporation 
the company also entered into a patent cross license agreement with intel in october in the future  the company will receive royalties under these agreements based on sales of flash products 
gross profits 
in fiscal  gross profits increased to million or of revenues from million or of revenues in  and million or of revenues in sandisk completed its transition from mbit to mbit technology in the third quarter of for the year ended december   mbit products represented of the company s units shipped up from in the prior year 
product gross margins declined in to of product revenues from in due to the shift in product mix to lower capacity products where average selling prices declined faster than product costs 
revenues from patent cross license royalties partially offset the lower product gross margins in the company expects price competition to increase in the future  which will likely result in decreased average selling prices and gross margins 
as a result  the company expects gross margins to decline in the near term from the level experienced in  and gross margins are expected to be subject to fluctuation for the foreseeable future 
to remain competitive  the company will be focusing on a number of programs to lower its manufacturing costs 
these include transitioning from single to double density flash designs  from to micron manufacturing processes  and utilizing inch instead of inch wafers 
these transitions are expected to occur over the next several quarters 
the utilization of semiconductor devices with greater memory capacity and the design and implementation of new semiconductor manufacturing processes can entail a number of problems  including lower yields associated with semiconductor device production and production delays 
there can be no assurance that such devices or processes will be successfully developed by the company or that development of such processes will lower manufacturing costs 
see item business risk factors risks associated with transitioning to new products and processes 
due to the emerging nature of the company s markets and certain planned product transitions  the company has had difficulty forecasting future inventory levels required to meet customer demand 
as a result of both contractual obligations and manufacturing cycle time  the company has been required to order wafers from its foundries approximately six months in advance of the ultimate shipment of its products 
under the company s wafer supply agreements  there are limits on the number of wafers the company can order and the company s ability to change that quantity is restricted 
accordingly  the company s ability to react to significant fluctuations in demand for its products is limited 
as a result  the company has not been able to match its purchases of wafers to specific customer orders and therefore the company has taken write downs for potential excess inventory purchased prior to the receipt of customer orders 
these adjustments decrease gross margins in the quarter reported and have resulted  and could in the future result  in fluctuations in gross margins on a quarter to quarter basis 
see item business risk factors fluctuations in operating results 
currently a significant portion of the company s wafer purchases are denominated in japanese yen 
as a result  exchange rate fluctuations can affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations see item business risk factors international operations

depending on the demand for the company s products  the company may decide to make substantial additional investment in manufacturing capacity to support its business in the future 
impact of currency exchange rates the company currently purchases wafers from matsushita under purchase contracts denominated in yen 
a portion of the company s revenues are also denominated in yen 
foreign exchange exposures arising from the company s yen denominated commitments and related accounts payable are offset to the extent the company has yen denominated accounts receivable and cash balances 
to the extent such foreign exchange exposures are not offset  the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding 
while the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on foreign exchange contracts substantially offsets the related impact on the underlying items hedged  the appreciation of the yen against the us dollar in resulted in higher costs to the company  which were reflected in the company s gross margins in the second half of future exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
