item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a 
overview and organization the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
the company is a real estate investment trust reit whose operations consist primarily of the acquisition  development  rehabilitation and management of apartment communities located in the southeast and texas 
as of december   the company owns apartment communities consisting of  units and also has investments in six retail centers  two of which are held in joint venture investments 
over the next two to three years  the company expects the retail properties will be marketed for sale and subsequently replaced with multi family properties 
the company also has approximately multifamily units under development 
upreit reorganization the company reorganized as an umbrella partnership upreit on may  whereby the company contributed substantially all of its assets subject to all liabilities to bri op limited partnership operating partnership in which the company is general partner 
in addition  on may   george and douglas krupp and other minority investors in gn limited partnership contributed river oaks apartments in exchange for  units units in the operating partnership 
the units are convertible to shares only upon shareholder approval 
the purpose of becoming an upreit is to allow the company to offer units in the underlying operating partnership in exchange for assets from tax motivated sellers 
under certain circumstances  the exchange of operating partnership units for a seller s assets will defer the tax liability associated with the sale 
effectively  this allows the company to use operating partnership units instead of stock or cash to acquire properties which provides an advantage over non upreit entities 
advisor transaction until early  the company was advised by berkshire realty advisors advisor  an affiliate of certain directors and officers of the company  including george and douglas krupp 
the board of directors determined that it was in the best interest of the shareholders to become self advised 
therefore  on february   the board  acting on the recommendation of a special committee comprised of the independent directors  approved the acquisition via contribution of the advisory and development services business advisor transaction of the advisor in exchange for  newly issued units of the operating partnership 
the contribution was completed on march  as of that date  all charges and expenses associated with the advisory services agreement ceased and the company became a self administered reit 
in conjunction with the advisor transaction  additional units  up to a total of million in value  may be issued to the contributor during a six year period if certain share price benchmarks are achieved 
see note c to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   no additional units have been issued 
the advisor transaction was accounted for under the purchase method 
the value of the transaction was based on  units at a share price of  or million  which was recorded as goodwill and is amortized on a straight line method over a year period 
also  legal fees and professional services expenses associated with the advisor transaction were capitalized and are being amortized over the same year period 
property management transaction besides becoming self administered  the board of directors and management determined that the company should become self managed 
on february   based on the recommendation of a special committee of the independent directors  the board approved the acquisition of the multifamily property management business of an affiliate of certain officers and directors for  units in the operating partnership 
the transaction was valued at million based on a per share price which closed on february   and will be recorded as intangible assets and goodwill 
the acquired property manager manages multifamily assets  of which are the company s and the remainder are primarily owned by affiliated partnerships of certain officers and directors 
by becoming self managed the company will no longer pay management fees and reimbursements for multifamily assets and will receive fees and reimbursements for managing the assets of others 
in addition  the company assumed approximately non site employees engaged in the operation of the property manager

the company has announced a plan to liquidate the retail portfolio over the next several years and reinvest the proceeds into acquisitions or development of multifamily assets 
this divesture strategy necessitated the valuation adjustments which represent the differences between current market value of these assets and their carrying value see note d to the consolidated financial statements for additional details

funds from operations fully adjusted for operating partnership units industry analysts generally consider funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate measure of the performance of an equity reit 
however  ffo should not be considered by the reader as a substitute to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the operating results of the company  ffo should be analyzed in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements 
ffo is determined in accordance with a resolution adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  and is defined as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is calculated for the periods presented as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  net income loss    depreciation including depreciation related to joint ventures    amortization of goodwill  minority interest  gains of sale of investments and payoff of mortgage loans receivable   non recurring charges   extraordinary items provision for losses including reserves recorded on joint venture investments  funds from operations    weighted average shares    units   total    same store apartment communities the company defines same store apartment communities as those that are fully stabilized for the two most recent years

same store noi increased for the twelve months ended december  when compared to average occupancies have decreased as a result of tenant losses in three retail assets and the closing of  square feet of commercial office space at another property

liquidity and capital resources historically  operations  debt financing and sales of assets have been the sources of liquidity employed by the company 
operating cash flows are earmarked for the payment of dividends as well as capital expenditures of a recurring nature 
debt financing and proceeds from asset sales have been used to finance acquisitions  development and rehabilitation of apartment communities 
the company s policy is to pay dividends to investors as a percentage of ffo 
for the past three years  the company has paid between and of ffo in dividends  retaining the rest for recurring capital expenditures and working capital 
the company expects to increase both ffo and dividends in the future but will strive to gradually reduce the payout ratio so as to utilize some internally generated funds for growth 
on february   the board approved a dividend of 
per share payable on may  to the shareholders of record on may  the company has a policy to maintain leverage at or below of reasonably estimated fair value of assets 
by employing moderate leverage ratios  the company can continue to generate sufficient cash flows to operate its business as well as sustain dividends to shareholders 
debt as a percentage of fair value as estimated by management for each of the two years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the following table represents the components of debt as of december   and december  amount percent amount percent dollar amounts in millions short term variable long term fixed in and  million of variable rate debt has been included as fixed because the company entered into a five year fixed interest rate swap agreement with a bank for a million notional contract thereby fixing variable rate exposure on that amount at 
the company conservatively manages both interest rate risk and maturity risk 
through the use of a swap  the company has hedged interest rate risk on approximately of its variable rate debt and variable rate debt to total debt was at december  additionally  the company has spread its maturities on long term debt and has weighted average maturities of years 
the company has adequate sources of liquidity to meet its current cash flow requirements including dividends  capital improvements as well as planned acquisitions 
since becoming an upreit in  the company has issued through december    units in the operating partnership which  if converted on december  at the then current share price of  represents million in additional equity capital 
approximately of these operating partnership units were issued for the acquisition of seven multifamily communities  five of which were acquired from unrelated sellers 
in  the company issued additional operating partnership units in connection with the acquisition of the property manager as discussed above  as well as for the acquisition of a multifamily asset from another unrelated seller 
it is the company s intention to continue to use operating partnership units as a form of currency to grow the asset base of the company 
future capital offerings are also being considered  however  the company is not currently engaged in a secondary or preferred stock offering 
equity capital  whether publicly or privately raised  will be utilized when the company sees the opportunity to invest the proceeds in assets that would increase shareholder returns 
the company currently has sufficient unadvanced commitments under debt facilities to fund ongoing development and rehabilitation activities 
e 
business conditions risks the company believes that favorable economic conditions exist in substantially all of its real estate markets 
for the company s stabilized apartment communities  physical occupancy was as of december  which generally represents current market occupancies 
in addition  the company continues to maintain competitive rental rates by providing superior services combined with well maintained assets which sets the company apart from its competition 
through intense asset management efforts  the company expects to realize solid performance from the real estate assets and to continue its favorable rental results  however  no assurances can be made in this regard 
the company is also involved in legal actions and claims in the ordinary course of its business 
it is the opinion of management and its legal counsel  that such litigation and claims should be resolved without material effect on the company s financial position
