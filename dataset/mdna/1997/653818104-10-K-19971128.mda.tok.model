item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and business environment the company is a leading provider of high performance technology based solutions and services where information access  movement  and evaluation are mission critical to an organization s success 
the company provides these services to a wide range of clients  including the department of defense dod  other federal agencies  state and local governments  healthcare and insurance organizations  and commercial enterprises 
the company was founded in to develop specialized optical sensing capabilities for military weapons and ballistic defense programs 
until fiscal year  virtually all of the company s revenues were derived under contracts with the federal government relating to high technology weapons systems  strategic missile defense and other related aerospace technologies 
areas of particular strength have included tactical technology  smart sensing systems  simulations  data processing  systems engineering and systems integration including software development  networking  hardware acquisition and installation  user training and system operation and maintenance 
beginning in fiscal year  in response to increasing budget pressure on military procurements  the company strategically began to develop applications for its technical capabilities outside its traditional core military business 
although the company s core military business has continued to grow  the company has successfully entered the markets for other government information technology solutions  as well as information technology solutions in the healthcare industry and other commercial markets 
the company s business strategy consists of three key elements i maintain the company s leadership in technology in its current markets  ii apply the company s technology to create solutions for new clients  and iii make strategic acquisitions and form alliances to expand the business of the company and gain industry knowledge 
the company s business and financial performance are subject to risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below 
in july  the company announced a formal organization definition for its four strategic business units 
the organizations reflect the particular market focus of each line of business 
nichols federal provides technical services primarily to us government defense agencies 
nichols infofed provides information and technology services to a variety of governmental agencies 
nichols infotec provides information and technology services to various commercial clients 
nichols select provides information services to clients in the healthcare and insurance industries 
for the year ended august   the percentage of total revenues attributable to the four business units was approximately for nichols federal  for nichols infofed  for nichols infotec  and for nichols select 
the percentage of revenues represented by nichols select for fiscal year is expected to increase as a result of acquiring the remaining of txen  inc on august  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
expansion through acquisitions is an important component of the company s overall business strategy 
the company has successfully completed eight strategic acquisitions and alliances since september   most of which have centered on information technology it and healthcare information services markets 
since the respective dates of the acquisitions  the company has integrated these acquired entities in order to draw on the company s base of technical expertise and capabilities in designing solutions for government  commercial  and healthcare clients 
the company s continued ability to grow by acquisitions is dependent upon  and may be limited by  the availability of compatible acquisition candidates at reasonable prices  the company s ability to fund or finance acquisitions on acceptable terms  and the company s ability to maintain or enhance the profitability of any acquired business 
as part of the company s business strategy to enter new markets  the company continues to pursue large systems integration contracts in both the government and commercial markets  although competition for such contracts is intense and many of the company s competitors have greater resources than the company 
while such contracts are working capital intensive  requiring large equipment and software purchases to be funded by the company before payment from the customer  the company believes such contracts offer attractive revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities for the company s range of technical expertise and capabilities 
the company s revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on such factors as the number  size  and scope of projects in which the company is engaged  the contractual terms and degree of completion of such projects  expenditures required by the company in connection with such projects  any delays incurred in connection with such projects  employee utilization rates  the adequacy of provisions for losses  the accuracy of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  and general economic conditions 
under certain contracts  the company is required to purchase and resell to the customer large amounts of computer hardware and other equipment 
revenues are accrued when this equipment is acquired for resale  and as a result  quarterly revenues will be impacted by fluctuations related to equipment purchases which occur on a periodic basis depending on contract terms 
approximately   and of the company s total revenues in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal were derived from contracts or subcontracts funded by the us government 
these us government contracts include military weapons systems contracts funded by dod that accounted for approximately   and of the company s total revenues in such years  respectively 
the company believes that the success and development of its business will continue to be dependent upon its ability to participate in us government contract programs 
accordingly  the company s financial performance may be directly affected by changing us government procurement practices and policies 
other factors that could materially and adversely affect the company s government contracting business and programs include budgetary constraints  changes in fiscal policies or available funding  changes in government programs or requirements including proposals to abolish certain government agencies or departments  curtailing the us government s use of technology services firms  the adoption of new laws or regulations  technological developments and general economic conditions 
these factors could cause us government agencies to exercise their rights to terminate existing contracts for convenience or not to exercise options to renew such contracts 
in addition  certain of the company s contracts individually contribute a significant percentage of the company s revenues 
for the year ended august   the company s two largest contracts by revenues were high performance systems integration contracts  which generated approximately of the company s total revenues for such period  these two contracts are expected to represent less than of fiscal year revenues 
the company s five largest contracts by revenues generated approximately of the company s total revenues for such period 
the company expects revenues to continue to be concentrated in a relatively small number of large us government contracts 
termination of such contracts  or the company s inability to renew or replace such contracts when they expire  could materially and adversely affect the company s revenues and income 
historically  a majority of the company s revenues for the year ended august  are related to us military weapons systems 
the us military weapons budget has been declining in real terms since the mid s  resulting in some cases in program delays  extensions  and cancellations 
a further significant decline in us military expenditures for weapons systems  or a reduction in the weapons systems portion of the defense budget  could materially and adversely affect the company 
the loss or significant curtailment of the company s us military contracts would materially and adversely affect the company s revenues and income 
approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal were from contracts related to ballistic missile defense bmd  compared to of revenues in fiscal and of revenues in fiscal from such contracts 
strategic defense has existed for more than years as a mission of dod through activities such as the bmd program 
if a decision were made to reduce substantially the scope of current bmd programs  management believes that many national and theater missile defense programs would continue to be funded by the us army and air force  and other dod agencies 
while the company has expanded into other markets  a decision to reduce significantly or eliminate missile defense funding would have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and income 
the company performs its services under us government contracts that usually require performance over a period of one to five years 
long term contracts may be conditioned upon continued availability of congressional appropriations 
variances between anticipated budgets and congressional appropriations may result in delay  reduction  or termination of such contracts 
contractors can experience revenue uncertainties with respect to available contract funding during the first quarter of the government s fiscal year beginning october  until differences between budget requests and appropriations are resolved 
the company s contracts with the us government and its prime contractors are subject to termination  in whole or in part  either upon default by the company or at the convenience of the government 
the termination for convenience provisions generally entitle the company to recover costs incurred  settlement expenses  and profit on work completed prior to termination 
because the company contracts to supply goods and services to the us government  it is also subject to other risks  including contract suspensions  audit adjustments  protests by disappointed bidders of contract awards which can result in the re opening of the bidding process and changes in government policies or regulations 
the company s services are provided primarily through three types of contracts fixed price  time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts 
fixed price contracts require the company to perform services under a contract at a stipulated price 
time and materials contracts reimburse the company for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract  plus the cost of materials incurred 
under cost reimbursement contracts  the company is reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent that such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract  plus a fee or profit 
the company assumes greater financial risk on fixed price contracts than on either time and materials or cost reimbursement contracts 
as the company increases its commercial business  it believes that an increasing percentage of its contracts will be fixed priced 
failure to anticipate technical problems  estimate costs accurately  or control costs during performance of a fixed price contract  may reduce the company s profit or cause a loss 
in addition  greater risks are involved under time and materials contracts than under cost reimbursement contracts because the company assumes the responsibility for the delivery of specified skills at a fixed hourly rate 
although management believes that adequate provision for its fixed price and time and materials contracts is reflected in the company s financial statements  no assurance can be given that this provision is adequate or that losses on fixed price and time and materials contracts will not occur in the future 
to compete successfully for business  the company must satisfy client requirements at competitive rates 
although the company continually attempts to lower its costs  there are other information technology and technical services companies that may provide the same or similar services at comparable or lower rates than the company 
additionally  certain of the company s clients require that their vendors reduce rates after services have commenced 
the company s success will also depend upon its ability to attract  retain  train  and motivate highly skilled employees  particularly in the areas of information technology  where such employees are in great demand

revenues increased million in fiscal approximately of the increase was attributable to revenues from two high performance system integration contracts awarded in during fiscal year  the two contracts generated of the company s total revenues 
at august  a substantial portion of the two contract values have been realized and it is expected that the contracts will generate less than of the company s total revenues in fiscal year approximately of the increase in revenues was attributable to acquisitions completed late in fiscal year approximately of the increase in revenues was attributable to the existing contract base 
operating profit 
the company expensed million of costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal for research and development activities in process at the time of the acquisition of the remaining of txen  inc stock 
including the million write off of purchased in process research and development associated with the acquisition of txen  inc  operating profit decreased million in fiscal excluding the million write off of purchased in process research and development  operating profit increased million in fiscal including the write off of purchased in process research and development  costs and expenses were of revenues compared to for fiscal the write off of purchased in process research and development represents of total costs and expenses 
excluding the purchase of in process research and development  costs and expenses were of revenues for fiscal as compared to for fiscal direct and allocable costs increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily the result of increased purchases of hardware  software and subcontractor services in the performance of government contracts 
direct and allocable costs as a percent of revenue increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal as a result of lower margins typically realized on the purchased hardware  software  and subcontractor services 
general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily a result of investments in marketing and infrastructure resources made in fiscal which are expected to support future commercial revenues 
other income expense 
other income expense increased  in as compared to other income includes equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and interest income  other expense includes interest expense and minority interest 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primarily represents the company s share of earnings of txen  inc as of august   txen  inc became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
interest income is from the investment of the company s cash reserves 
substantially all available cash is invested in interest bearing accounts or fixed income instruments 
minority interest primarily represents the minority partner s share of earnings of holland technology group and holland software solutions joint ventures  of which are owned by the company 
the company began consolidating these entities at the beginning of fiscal year income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes was in fiscal and in fiscal the million write off of purchased in process research and development in the fourth quarter of fiscal is not deductible for tax purposes 
net income 
including the million write off of purchased in process research and development  net income decreased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is the result of the impact of the million write off of purchased in process research and development 
earnings per share 
earnings per share for fiscal were as compared to for fiscal  a decrease of 
excluding the million write off of purchased in process research and development  earnings per share were as compared to for fiscal  a increase 
excluding the million write off of purchased in process research and development  net income increased million  while weighted average shares outstanding increased  shares for fiscal as compared to fiscal comparison of operating results for fiscal with fiscal revenues 
revenues increased million in fiscal approximately of the increase was attributable to revenues from the high performance systems integration contracts 
approximately of the increase was attributable to acquisitions completed in fiscal year and late fiscal approximately of the increase in revenues was attributable to the existing contract base 
operating profit 
operating profit increased million in fiscal costs and expenses were of revenues for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the reduction in direct and allocable costs as a percentage of revenues was offset by increases in general and administrative expenses 
the company used contract cost reductions and increased margins to fund increases in business development and marketing efforts  primarily with commercial market opportunities 
other income expense 
other income consists primarily of interest income 
substantially all available cash is invested in interest bearing accounts or fixed income instruments 
the decrease in other income expense for fiscal is the result of the use of cash to make strategic acquisitions and investments and an increase in interest expense on borrowings used to make strategic acquisitions 
income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal net income 
net income increased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is the result of the reasons discussed above 
earnings per share 
earnings per share for fiscal were as compared to for fiscal  an increase of 
net income increased million  while weighted average shares outstanding increased  shares for fiscal as compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s positive cash flow from operations and available credit facilities have provided adequate liquidity and working capital to fully fund the company s operational needs and support the acquisition program 
working capital was million  million  and million at august   and  respectively 
operating activities provided cash of million for the year ended august   used cash of million for the year ended august  and provided cash of million for the year ended august  the company realized proceeds from the sale of common stock and reissuance of treasury stock of million  million  and million for the years ended august   and  respectively 
the proceeds of million in fiscal include net proceeds of million from the sale of its common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement covering  shares of the company s common stock as adjusted for a for stock split effective october  
these proceeds were used to repay million of indebtedness under its existing bank line of credit facility and fund working capital requirements 
the company has a bank line of credit of million which expires in november the company believes that this line of credit will be renewed or replaced with a comparable facility at similar terms and conditions 
the credit agreement provides for interest at london interbank offered rate plus and a commitment fee on the unused portion of the line of credit 
outstanding borrowings are secured primarily by accounts receivable 
in fiscal  the company borrowed million under an alabama state industrial development bond program offering certain incentives which effectively reduced the cost of borrowing 
the proceeds were utilized to expand acquisitions of property and equipment for information technology programs 
purchases of property and equipment were million  million  and million for the years ended august   and  respectively 
there are no material capital expenditure commitments at august  the company is regularly evaluating potential acquisition candidates 
in fiscal  the company acquired a interest in three separate information system development and technology companies 
these companies provide services primarily to commercial and healthcare clients 
the aggregate cash consideration for these transactions was approximately million 
in may  the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of advanced marine enterprises ame  inc for cash consideration of approximately million and  shares of company stock 
these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  resulting in intangible assets with estimated useful lives ranging from five to fifteen years 
in fiscal year  the company purchased of txen for approximately million 
in august  the company exercised its option to acquire the remaining interest of txen  inc txen for aggregate consideration of approximately million  consisting of approximately million in cash and million in company stock 
the total purchase price with respect to the txen acquisition has been allocated to the txen assets and liabilities on a preliminary basis  subject to a final allocation among intangible assets 
the preliminary allocation of intangible assets includes million to in process research and development  expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and million to goodwill 
the portion of such million classified as goodwill will be amortized using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of twenty years 
if all or a part of such million is allocated to intangible assets other than goodwill  such assets would likely have an amortization period of less than twenty years 
in fiscal  the company was awarded two contracts for information system development and computer system integration activities  which required the company to acquire substantial amounts of computer hardware for resale or lease to customers 
the company continues to actively pursue other contracts that could require similar equipment acquisitions 
the timing of payments to suppliers and payments from customers under the company s system integration contracts could cause cash flows from operations to fluctuate from period to period 
the company believes that its existing capital resources  together with available borrowing capacity  will be sufficient to fund operating needs  finance acquisitions of property and equipment  and make strategic acquisitions  if appropriate 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 earnings per share 
the overall objective of statement no 
is to simplify the calculation of earnings per share eps and achieve comparability with recently issued international accounting standards 
the company will first report on the new eps basis in the fourth quarter ending august  subsequent to the effective date  all prior period eps amounts including information regarding eps in interim financial statements  earnings summaries  and selected financial data are required to be restated to conform to the provisions of statement no 
effects of inflation substantially all contracts awarded to the company have been based on proposals which reflect estimated cost increases due to inflation 
historically  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company
