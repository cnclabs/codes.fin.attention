the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
wherever in this discussion the term company is used  it should be understood to refer to shpi and shp  on a consolidated basis  except where the context clearly indicates to the contrary 
prior to the acquisition  shpi had no operations 
overview from its inception  the company has incurred losses from operations 
as of december   the company had cumulative net losses totaling  to date  the company s principal focus has been the design  development  testing  and evaluation of its safety cradle r sharps containers  extresafe tm lancet strip  extresafe tm medical needle withdrawal technology  intravenous flow gauge  blood collection device  and other products  and the design and development of its molds and production processes relating to its safety cradle r sharps containers 
financial position the company had  in cash and cash equivalents as of december  this represented a decrease of  from december  working capital as of december   also decreased to  as compared to  at december  these decreases were largely due to the company s net loss of  and  in capital expenditures during the year ended december  years ended december   and during the year ended december   the company had sales of  compared with sales of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
all sales relate to the company s sharps container products which were the only product the company was selling during said periods 
sales during the year ended december   were hampered because the company entered into an agreement the agreement with bd on march   whereby bd was given the right to evaluate the company s safety cradle r sharps container for a period of three months while bd and the company considered entering into an exclusive marketing and distribution agreement 
this agreement prohibited the company from entering into distributor agreements that would interfere with the company executing an exclusive marketing and distribution agreement with bd upon expiration of the agreement 
the agreement  therefore  limited sales of the company s safety cradle r sharps container products in the second and third quarters of in addition  sales during the first and second quarters of were hampered due to improvements that were being made to the molds used to produce the company s sharps container products 
the improvements were completed in the first quarter of on august   the company entered into an exclusive distribution agreement the distribution agreement with bd relating to the company s safety cradle r sharps container products 
the distribution agreement grants bd an exclusive world wide right to market and distribute the company s safety cradle r sharps container products for an initial term of three years  which term may be extended by bd annually thereafter 
the first sales pursuant to the distribution agreement occurred in the first quarter of sales were delayed because the distribution agreement required the company to receive a new k notification relating to its safety cradle r sharps container products  make certain modifications to the containers and its manufacturer was required to meet certain bd standards before sales would begin collectively  the bd modifications 
the bd modifications were completed before year end 
bd was then late in getting the safety cradle r sharps container products to its sales people and  as a result  sales of the products were delayed until march the distribution agreement provides that products may be sold  at bd s option  either under the company s name or under bd s label 
the products will  however  be imprinted with the company s name 
the sales price of the products to bd under the distribution agreement can be adjusted under certain circumstances for changes in raw material costs during the initial term of the distribution agreement 
the company is not required to distribute any future  unrelated products through bd 
the distribution agreement presents certain risks to the company 
these include  among other things i reliance for sale of the products on bd  and therefore reliance on bd s marketing ability  marketing plans  credit worthiness and selling efforts  ii if the products are marketed under bd s label  goodwill associated with the products may inure to the benefit of bd rather than the company  iii the company has only limited protection from changes in manufacturing costs other than raw materials costs during the initial term of the distribution agreement  and iv if the company is reliant on bd for all or substantially all of its sales  the company may be restricted in its ability to effectively negotiate with bd concerning pricing or other terms upon extension of the initial three year term of the distribution agreement by bd 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december   compared with  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s efforts in the year ended december   focused on making certain improvements to the safety cradle r sharps container products that were required by the agreement and otherwise  finalizing the development of the extresafe tm lancet strip  extresafe tm medical needle withdrawal technology  intravenous flow gauge and blood collection device 
the company s efforts in the years ended december  and  were focused on refining the design and molds for its safety cradle r sharps container products  and upon the design and development of its extresafe tm lancet strip  extresafe tm medical needle withdrawal technology  intravenous flow gauge and blood collection device 
research and development expenses during were limited because of funding constraints 
funding constraints also set back the anticipated dates on which the company s products under development will be brought to market 
it is anticipated that if the company has adequate funding during  research and development expenses will increase over levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increased costs from period to period have resulted mainly from increases in the following expenditures 
first  selling and consulting costs increased as a result of increased efforts to market and sell the safety cradle r sharps container products 
second  salaries and benefits increased as a result of hiring additional product development  sales and marketing personnel to support sales and commercialization of the company s products as well as pay increases made to certain of the company s employees 
third  consulting  legal and accounting fees increased as a result of the company s entrance into the financial markets  the increased level of operational sophistication and of the company s reporting obligations under applicable securities laws 
finally  travel and entertainment costs increased as a result of expenses associated with financing  manufacturing  selling  and marketing activities 
net other income was  for the year ended december   compared with net other income of  for the year ended december  and net other expense of  for the year ended december  most of the other income earned during and relates to interest earned on funds derived from the sale of the company s equity securities in august unless the company generates additional cash through product sales or financing  the other income for will be substantially less than other income during and liquidity and capital resources the company s need for funds has increased from period to period as it has increased its research and development activities  expanded staff  and commenced the purchase and construction of molds and production equipment 
to date the company has financed its operations principally through private placements of equity securities and debt 
through december   the company had received net proceeds of approximately  through financing activities 
the bulk of the proceeds from the company s financing activity resulted from the sale of equity securities 
as of december   the company s liabilities totaled  all of these liabilities are current liabilities 
the company had working capital as of december  of  and the company used net cash in operating activities of  during at december   the company had  series a warrants and  series b warrants outstanding which are exercisable for shares of common stock of the company at a price of per share in the case of series a warrants and per share in the case of series b warrants  and expire on the earlier of a two years from the date of effectiveness of a registration statement under the securities act covering the issuance of the shares of common stock underlying such warrants upon issuance by the company or for resale of such stock by the holder  which period shall be extended day for day for any time that a prospectus meeting the requirements of the securities act is not available  or b the date specified in a notice of redemption from the company subject to the prior right of the holder to exercise the warrants for at least days following the date of such notice in the event that the closing price of the common stock for any ten consecutive trading days preceding such notice exceeds per share and subject to the availability of a current prospectus covering the underlying stock 
thus  the company may accelerate the expiration of the warrants in the event that the average market price of the common stock exceeds per share  in which event the holders of the warrants would be permitted to exercise the warrants during a period of not less than days following notice of such an event 
the exercise of all the series a and series b warrants would result in a gross cash inflow to the company of  the company presently intends to accelerate the expiration of the warrants when and if such conditions are met 
all of the warrants are currently outstanding 
there can be no assurance  however  that any of the warrants will be exercised 
on september   the company adopted a non qualified stock option plan nqsop wherein the company is authorized to grant options to purchase up to  shares of common stock of the company 
all options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
the company has granted stock options to purchase  shares of common stock under the nqsop 
in addition to the options outstanding under the nqsop  the company also has  options outstanding that were issued under the shp non qualified stock option plan shp nqsop that became obligations of the company pursuant to the terms of the acquisition 
the company has provided certain officers and directors of the company the opportunity to receive up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock the earn out shares 
any issuance of earn out shares would be based upon the level of pre tax consolidated net income  adjusted to exclude any charge arising from the obligation to issue or the issuance of the earn out shares and any income or charge associated with non recurring or extraordinary items as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles adjusted ptni 
the company expects that the issuance of earn out shares will be deemed to be compensation to the recipients and will result in a charge to earnings in the year or years the earn out shares are earned  in an amount equal to the fair market value of the earn out shares 
this charge to earnings could have a substantial negative impact on the earnings of the company in the year or years in which the compensation expense is recognized 
the effect of the charge to earnings associated with the issuance of earn out shares could place the company in a net loss position for the relevant year  even though the adjusted ptni was at a level requiring the issuance of earn out shares 
because earn out shares are issuable based on the results of a single year  the adjusted ptni in a particular year could require the issuance of earn out shares even though the cumulative adjusted ptni for the three years  and  or any combination of those years  could reflect a lower amount of adjusted ptni that would not require the company to issue such earn out shares or even a loss at the adjusted ptni line 
there is no assurance that years subsequent to the year or years in which earn out shares are issued will produce the same level of adjusted ptni or will be profitable 
the management of the company may have the discretion to accelerate or defer certain transactions that could shift revenue or charges between years or otherwise affect the adjusted ptni in any year or years 
the company has agreed to file a registration statement under the securities act with respect to the earn out shares  when issued 
the issuance of the earn out shares  or the perception that the issuance of such stock may occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock 
the company and zerbec  inc  as joint venturers  formed quantum to develop  make and distribute an improved filmless digitized imaging system 
pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreement  zerbec  inc assigned patented filmless digitized imaging technology to quantum  and will provide ongoing support in the development and commercialization of the technology

it is anticipated that at least one third of the outstanding shares of quantum will be sold to fund development through initial production of related filmless digitized imaging systems 
in addition  if at least  in funding is not raised by june   then zerbec  inc has the right to acquire two thirds of shp s interest in the venture for one dollar the zerbec option 
shp is trying to negotiate an agreement with zerbec  inc whereby shp can acquire zerbec inc 
s interest in quantum the zerbec acquisition or an extension of the date at which the zerbec option vests 
there can be no assurance that shp will be able to negotiate  on terms acceptable and or favorable to shp  an agreement relating to the zerbec acquisition or an extension of the date on which the zerbec option vests 
as a result  the company s ownership interest may decrease as a result the company s inability to negotiate an agreement with zerbec  inc and or from dilution by a financing party

robinson exercised his stock options to acquire  shares of the company s common stock for  on march   the company entered into a letter of intent with bd which contemplates a license agreement related to the development  manufacture  distribution and commercialization of a product utilizing the company s extresafe tm technology 
if a license agreement is consummated  the company anticipates that bd will distribute at least one  and possibly several  of the company s products utilizing the extresafe tm technology on an exclusive basis 
under the terms of the letter of intent  bd would pay the company million in prepaid royalties and development fees in two equal payments which payments relate to the first product utilizing the extresafe tm technology to be licensed to bd 
the financial terms relating to additional products licensed to bd would be subject to negotiation 
the first payment would be made within thirty days of execution of a license agreement and the second payment no later than march the proposal is subject to the satisfactory completion of a legal and business investigation and due diligence review of the company s intellectual property portfolio by bd and the approval of the boards of directors of the company and bd 
on march   the company completed a private placement the private placement wherein the company raised  through offering of units to certain accredited investors for forty five dollars per unit 
each unit consisted of fifteen shares of the company s 
par value common stock and series c warrants to purchase five shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the series c warrants will be exercisable upon issuance and expire two years from the date of effectiveness of a registration statement under the securities act of the act covering the resale of the shares of common stock underlying the series c warrants by the holder  which period shall be extended day for day for any time that a prospectus meeting the requirements of the act is not available

the company s working capital and other capital requirements during the next year or more will vary based upon a number of factors  including the cost to complete development and bring the extresafe tm medical needle withdrawal technology  intravenous flow gauge blood collection device and other products to commercial viability  and the level of sales and marketing for the safety cradle r sharps containers and extresafe tm lancet strip 
the company believes that the proceeds from the private placement  as well as sales generated from the safety cradle r sharps containers and extresafe tm lancet strips will be sufficient to support the company s operations and planned capital expenditures through if the company slows the commercialization of its products in development and sales increase substantially 
management is planning  however  to raise additional funds through a public or private offering of securities so commercialization of its products under development is not further delayed 
if sales do not begin to increase sufficiently during second and third quarters of  the company can and will cut operating costs and capital expenditures by focusing only on its sharps container  lancet products and other products that are or will shortly be ready to sell 
the company s failure  however  to produce or sell sufficient quantities of safety cradle r sharps container products and or extresafe tm lancets  raise additional funds  or sufficiently cut the cost of operations and capital expenditures could materially and adversely affect the company s cash flows 
in addition  the company s business plans may change or unforeseen events may occur which require the company to raise additional funds 
notwithstanding the foregoing  management may deplete cash reserves by maintaining or increasing spending if management determines that additional funding is likely 
inflation the company does not expect the impact of inflation on operations to be significant
