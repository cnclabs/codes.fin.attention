the million increase from sales was due primarily to higher commercial original equipment manufacturer oem and aftermarket sales both of which increased by more than percent from the prior year 
the growth reflects the increase in aircraft orders  continued airline traffic growth  and improved profitability in the airline industry 
military sales were flat in compared with aerospace segment sales in were million  which represents a million increase over sales and percent of total sales 
commercial sales in increased by million compared with due to a percent increase in aftermarket sales 
the growth in commercial aftermarket sales reflected the sustained growth in passenger traffic and previously depleted spare parts inventories 
commercial oem sales were flat in compared with as a result of a more than percent decrease in military oem sales and a more than percent decrease in military aftermarket sales  military sales in were million  a million decrease from the registrant s electric power systems product line electric power is the largest product line within the aerospace segment 
this product line accounted for more than percent of aerospace segment sales in   and sales in the industrial segment were million in  representing percent of total sales  compared with sales of million in excluding sales from milton roy s divested spectronic instruments spectronic business  sales increased by million from lower sales from sullair s industrial compressor business were more than offset by higher sales of falk s custom built products and higher domestic sales of sundstrand fluid handling s sundyne r product 
excluding spectronic  milton roy s sales were flat 
industrial segment sales were million in  representing percent of total sales  compared with sales of million 
excluding sales from the spectronic business  sales at all three industrial businesses increased by approximately percent from the sales increases resulted primarily from an upturn in the cyclical markets which the industrial businesses serve 
operating profit by business segment operating profit amounts in millions and operating profit as a percent of net sales amount amount amount business segment aerospace industrial total operating profit in the aerospace segment increased to million in from million in excluding restructuring related period costs and one time gains  operating profit was million  or percent of sales  compared with million  or percent of sales  in excluding restructuring related items 
the year over year increase was due primarily to the increase in commercial oem and aftermarket sales 
aerospace segment operating profit decreased by million to million in from million in excluding the restructuring charge of million and the related period costs of million  operating profit was million  or percent of sales 
the operating profit increase  excluding the restructuring  was due primarily to the increase in high margin commercial aftermarket sales in and the effect of short term manufacturing inefficiencies in the short term manufacturing inefficiencies  which reduced operating profit substantially in  were related primarily to the transfer of production from the closed brea and san diego  california  plants to other aerospace facilities 
operating profit in the industrial segment in was million  which included a million restructuring charge related to sullair europe sa excluding the restructuring charge  operating profit was million  or percent of sales  compared with million  or percent of sales  in the decrease was due primarily to increased operating losses at sullair s european subsidiary and lower profitability at milton roy s flow control division resulting from lower volume and higher manufacturing costs  partially offset by the restructuring charge recorded to write down the assets of spectronic in industrial segment operating profit was million in compared with million in the increase was due primarily to increased sales and higher operating profit margins from all three industrial businesses  partially offset by the restructuring charge recorded to write down the assets of spectronic

operations currently at the st 
priest facility will be transferred to other plant sites in europe and the united states 
the shutdown of the st 
priest facility and termination or transfer of the employees is expected to be completed in late and it is anticipated that the sale of the facility will be completed by the end of no material restructuring amounts were paid in the net effect of cost savings and related expenses which were not subject to accrual are projected to result in pretax savings of million  million  and million in   and  respectively

accounts receivable increased primarily as a result of higher sales and the apic acquisition 
net cash flow from operating activities decreased to million in from million in excluding the restructuring charges and related items  operating cash flow did not change materially year over year as the unfavorable impact of fluctuations in accounts receivable and accounts payable balances were substantially offset by higher net earnings and the effect of increased accrued expenses 
the increase in accrued expenses in  excluding fluctuations in restructuring reserves  was due primarily to increases in advanced payments received from customers and other postretirement benefit liabilities 
net cash flow from operating activities in increased to million from million in excluding the restructuring  which reduced cash flow by approximately million  the increase was due primarily to improved net earnings in and a million tax payment related to the gain from the sale of sdc which decreased the net operating cash flow

commercial aftermarket sales should increase by about percent  while military sales are expected to increase by approximately percent to percent 
because of the acquisition of the electrical load management technology and related business from leach and the acquisition of the remaining interest in apic  the aerospace segment operating profit margin is expected to be reduced by about one and one half percentage points in in addition  strategic initiatives should reduce aerospace operating profit margins by up to an additional one percentage point 
despite these reductions  the aerospace segment is expected to generate an operating profit margin in the mid percent to mid percent range for  which should result in aerospace operating profit growing by percent to percent 
the registrant expects industrial segment sales to grow by up to percent in the industrial segment operating profit margin  excluding previously announced restructuring charges  is expected to be in the percent to percent range  which should result in industrial segment operating profit growing by percent to percent
