external factors 
fundamental shift in generic pharmaceutical industry distribution  purchasing and stocking patterns resulting in significantly lower sales and prices in the uspd 
significant bad debt expense due to the bankruptcy of a major wholesaler to the uspd and collection difficulties in certain international markets 
high feed grain prices in the animal health industry which resulted in lower industry usage of feed additive products supplied by ahd and increased competition among feed additive suppliers 
generally increased competition in all industries and markets served by the company s operating divisions

see sections management actions  us generic pharmaceutical industry and animal health division market conditions 
revenues declined by million in the animal health segment ahs 
the ahd revenues declined due to lower sales volume of bmdr and other feed additives primarily to the poultry market and price erosion due to competition 
the decline in the sale of other feed additives to the poultry market is attributable mainly to the mutual termination of a distribution agreement with merck agvet 
aahd revenues were lower due to the introduction of competitive products in the norwegian fish vaccine market and an overall reduction in norwegian salmon production 
revenues in the human pharmaceuticals segment hps were million lower primarily due to uspd revenues which declined approximately  as a result of price and volume reductions in the base product line principally cough and cold products due to a fundamental shift in industry distribution  purchasing and stocking patterns including a substantial drop in sales to generic drug distributors 
the declines were partially offset by increased sales of products introduced in and and sales of minoxidil introduced in the second quarter of revenues for ipd and fcd declined by and  respectively due to volume reductions and to a lesser extent currency translation offset partially by limited price increases 
on a consolidated basis  gross profit decreased million and the gross margin percent was in compared to in the gross profit for the animal health segment declined due to the lower volume sold of bmdr and high margin fish vaccines and generally lower pricing due to competition 
the gross profit in the pharmaceuticals segment declined over million due principally to the uspd 
the uspd was affected by lower sales volume  and significantly lower pricing across the product line due to changes in the generic pharmaceutical industry 
lower sales volume also affected gross profit by causing reduced production volume which increases production costs per unit 
ipd and fcd also had lower gross margins due primarily to lower sales 
in addition  includes million primarily for accrued stay bonuses for production employees in facilities to be closed in both the uspd and ipd 
included in management actions

the following table summarizes the above sg a as reported management actions described herein financial advisory fees bad debt expense related to the bankruptcy of a wholesaler sg a as adjusted the lack of growth in sg a  excluding the items described above  reflects an emphasis on cost control in response to difficult business conditions in a number of markets including lower bonuses paid in  a reduction of expenses resulting from prior year management actions which reduced payroll and generally flat selling and marketing expenses certain of which vary directly with sales 
operating income as reported declined million 
the company believes the change in operating income from to can be approximated as follows hps ahs unallocated total operating income sales gross profit decrease increase volume price new products increase decrease in production and operating expenses

loss per share 
revenue in the human pharmaceuticals segment accounted for million of the consolidated revenue increase 
the ipd accounted for the major portion of the hps increase 
ipd revenues increased due to volume growth in northern europe and indonesia  the translation of sales in norwegian kroner nok and danish kroner dkk into the us dollar and to a lesser extent selected price increases where permitted 
current pricing in a number of european markets continues to be suppressed in part by legislation enacted to contain pharmaceutical costs 
oral health care ohc revenues increased over million compared to and due to increased r d expenses the operating loss was approximately the same as sales by the fcd were approximately the same as in in local currencies but increased when translated into us dollars 
revenues in the uspd were flat on a year to year basis 
increases in sales of products introduced in late and including cimetidine hcl solution  clobetasol cream and ointment  clemastine fumarate syrup and a number of other over the counter and prescription products  some price increases and increased volume in a number of products were offset by declines in the volume of cough and cold products sold due to a mild flu season in early as well as the discontinuance of products containing iodinated glycerol in july of animal health segment revenues increased primarily due to the acquisition of the wade jones company  inc in july in addition  revenue increases were achieved due to higher sales internationally and  to a lesser extent  domestically  of disease preventative products used in poultry markets and sales of products made pursuant to a poultry products distribution agreement signed with merck agvet in july in the distribution agreement was terminated by mutual agreement as merck sold its poultry line to an unrelated third party 
bmdr sales increased marginally with volume gains in poultry markets  offset by lower volume in the domestic swine market which was impacted by adverse economic conditions experienced by pork producers 
the aahd sales of fish vaccines were lower than due to increased competition in the norwegian salmon farming market  offset partially by sales of newly introduced trout and other vaccines 
on a consolidated basis gross profit increased million and the gross margin percent increased to in compared to in gross profit dollars in hps accounted for a substantial amount of the dollar increase due to increased sales volume especially by the ipd  production efficiencies  the effect of translation of gross profits in dkk and nok into us dollars for both the ipd and fcd and selected price increases partially offset by the elimination of sales of high margin iodinated glycerol products 
gross profit percentages improved in hps as a result of increases in gross margin percentages and amounts in ipd and fcd which have higher than the prior years average gross margin percentage 
accordingly  the overall percentage increase is attributable to the hps 
gross profit dollars in the animal health segment increased at a rate lower than the sales increase 
the gross profit percent declined due to sales increases attributable to the wade jones company  inc  a distributor to the poultry market  and sales made pursuant to the poultry product distribution agreement with merck agvet 
the composition of animal health division sales has changed with the addition of these two distribution businesses which have lower gross margins 
in addition  gross profits were negatively affected due to lower volume of high gross margin fish vaccine sales 
operating expenses were million in compared to million in operating expenses in include a net benefit of 
million relating to post combination management actions 
the net benefit includes income from the sale of an equity interest and other rights in an r d company million offset by the utilization of substantial consulting resources focused primarily on accelerating the realization of certain combination benefits in the ipd million and severance of employees in the ipd  uspd and ahd million 
operating expenses in include management actions and transaction expenses totaling million summarized by segment as follows hps severance of million  million including the write off of million of intangibles for the exit of the uspd from the tablet business in the us  million for a write off of an intangible relating to an oral health care product which will no longer be marketed  
million for the write down to fair market value of land which will be held for sale  million for an accelerated payment for contractually committed research and development relating to a project which will no longer be funded by the company and 
million for closing sales offices and eliminating duplicate distributors and other 
ahs exiting of an antibiotic product and related equipment of million and severance of 
million 
unallocated expenses relate primarily to corporate functions and include severance of 
million and million for transaction expenses primarily for legal  accounting and investment banking services incurred in to complete the combination 
on a comparable basis  operating expenses increased approximately million compared to an sales increase 
operating expenses increased due to variable selling expense increases  additional research and development expenses  the acquisition of the wade jones company in july and the effect of the translation of nok and dkk expenses into us dollars 
post combination and transaction expenses impacted operating income by segment in and as follows hps ahs unallocated total operating income loss as reported transaction costs and post combination actions income expense operating income loss excluding transaction costs and post combination actions interest expense increased million for the year ended  due to increased debt levels resulting from the acquisition of alpharma oslo in october  increased capital expenditures in  the acquisition of the wade jones company  inc in july  and increased working capital requirements to support sales increases 
additionally  interest rates have generally increased relative to comparability is also affected in that the company restated the financials to reflect the acquisition of alpharma oslo in a manner similar to a pooling of interests 
the restated results for do not include interest expense on either the cash consideration or actual transaction costs which would have been incurred had the acquisition taken place in prior periods 
the company estimates that interest expense calculated on a comparable basis in would have been approximately million higher 
other income expense  net for includes net foreign exchange transaction losses of approximately 
million resulting from the translation of non functional currency receivables net of non functional currency payables and forward foreign exchange contracts 
the losses were primarily recorded by the company s subsidiaries in norway and denmark in the first quarter of and primarily relate to sales denominated in currencies ie ie dollar  swedish kroner  british pound and portuguese escudo which depreciated significantly in the first quarter compared to the nok and dkk 
in addition  currency losses were sustained by the company s mexican operations due to the devaluation of the mexican peso 
the provision for income taxes in was compared to income taxes in excess of pretax income in the rate in represents a more normal relationship and the diminishing effect as pre tax income increases of non deductible expenses primarily related to goodwill amortization 
inflation the effect of inflation on the company s operations during  and was not significant 
governmental actions affecting the company the company s operations in all countries are subject to regulation which includes inspections of manufacturing facilities  requires approvals to market products  and can result in the recall of products and suspension of production 
in the united states the food and drug administration fda has imposed stringent regulatory requirements on the pharmaceutical industry 
the us manufacturing companies included in the company s human pharmaceuticals segment  as well as two of the company s european facilities that manufacture products for export to the us  are affected in that they are required to comply with the fda s interpretation of cgmp 
in  and  regulatory compliance has continued to affect costs directly by requiring the addition of personnel  programs and capital and indirectly by adding activities without directly increasing efficiency 
the costs both direct and indirect of regulatory compliance which have increased in recent years may continue to increase in the future 
in the fourth quarter of the company recorded approximately million representing the estimated costs for a recall of certain lots of four products guiatuss ac and dac  dihistine expectorant and lidocaine 
this recall resulted from the company s ongoing internal quality programs which identified a required revision of expiration dates for these products 
in july  the company ceased the marketing of products which contain iodinated glycerol 
the cessation was the result of an industry wide banning of such products by the fda 
because the fda allowed for an orderly cessation of sales of these products the immediate impact was minimized 
iodinated glycerol products represented approximately of the company s sales and the loss of sales of these products negatively impacted the company s operations 
the company and its subsidiaries have filed applications to market products with regulatory agencies both in the us and internationally 
the timing of receipt of approvals of these applications can significantly increase future revenues and income 
the company cannot control or predict with accuracy whether such applications will be approved or the timing of their approval 
management actions in december  the company announced a number of management actions which included staff reductions and certain product line and facilities rationalizations as a first step toward realizing combination synergies and maximizing the overall position of the newly combined company 
as a part of the december management actions  the company discontinued funding research projects relating to the colonic delivery of drugs and committed to disposing of the resultant equity interest in the r d company performing the research 
in september  the company announced additional management actions which continued the process begun in december the actions include elimination of up to positions company wide employees were severed in  further efforts toward consolidation of operations in the company s uspd  the utilization of substantial consulting resources focused primarily on accelerating the realization of certain combination benefits in the ipd and the sale in september of its minority equity position and certain other rights in the r d company 
in the first quarter of the company continued the process and announced the reorganization of the ipd sales and marketing organization in scandinavia 
the reorganization resulted in severing personnel at a cost of million 
ipd estimates the annual expense reduction by from this action at over million 
in the second quarter of  the board of directors approved an ipd production rationalization plan which includes the transfer of all tablet  ointment and liquid production from copenhagen  denmark to lier  norway 
the full transfer will be completed in and will result in the net reduction of approximately employees 
the rationalization plan resulted in a charge in the second quarter for severance for copenhagen employees  an impairment write off for certain buildings and machinery and equipment and other exit costs 
in the company announced a plan by uspd to move all suppositories and cream and ointment production from two present locations to the lincolnton  nc location 
the transfer of prescription products requires the company to obtain the approval of the fda for each product transferred 
the company has been successful to date in the product transfer but the ultimate time necessary and complete success cannot be predicted with certainty by the company 
based on results through the second quarter of uspd prepared to plan to accelerate the previously approved plan for consolidation of the manufacturing operations within uspd 
the board of directors approved the acceleration in may the acceleration plan included the discontinuing of all activities in two uspd manufacturing facilities in new york and new jersey and the transfer of all pharmaceutical production from those sites to the facility in lincolnton  north carolina 
the plan provided for complete exit by early and has resulted in a net reduction of over employees 
the acceleration plan resulted in a second quarter charge for severance of employees  a write off for leasehold improvements and machinery and equipment and significant exit costs including estimated remaining lease costs and facility refurbishment costs 
in the third quarter of the company sold its tablet business which was located in new jersey and sub leased the new jersey location 
the sale netted proceeds of approximately 
million and resulted in the adjustment of certain accruals for exit costs made in the second quarter which contemplated the shut down of the facility 
because of the time necessary to complete the transfers  the production rationalization plans include stay bonus plans to keep the production work force intact until the transfer is complete 
the stay bonus plans generally require the employee remain until their position is eliminated to earn a payment 
the overall cost of these plans is estimated at million and is being accrued over the periods necessary to achieve the shut downs 
in the first quarter of the new york facility was shut down and the stay bonus has been substantially paid 
in the second half of additional management actions included a reorganization at uspd which resulted in severing employees and a reorganization of the animal health division business practices and staffing levels which resulted in severing and or early retirement of employees and other exit costs 
as a result of the reorganizations in uspd and ahd the company believes annual payroll and payroll related costs of million have been eliminated 
the production rationalization plans are expected to significantly benefit operations in for uspd and in for ipd 
the company believes the dynamic nature of its business may present additional opportunities to rationalize personnel functions and operations to increase efficiency and profitability 
accordingly  while no actions are presently planned  similar management actions or changes to announced management actions may be required in the future 
us generic pharmaceutical industry the us generic pharmaceutical industry has historically been characterized by intense competition which is evidenced by eroding prices for products as additional market participants receive approvals for these products 
growth has historically occurred through new product approvals and subsequent sales exceeding declines in the base product line due to price reductions and or volume decreases 
generic pharmaceutical market conditions were further exacerbated in the second half of by a rapidly emerging fundamental shift in industry distribution  purchasing and stocking patterns 
the shift has resulted in a substantial drop in the uspd s volume overall but in particular to generic drug distributors who represent an important but declining part of the company s base business 
programs initiated by major wholesalers have accelerated the changes and have forced prices to decline at a faster rate 
wholesaler programs generally require lower prices on products sold  lower inventory levels kept at the wholesaler and fewer manufacturers selected to provide products to the wholesalers 
the uspd has been affected by lower sales as distributors reduced business and as wholesalers reduced inventories and prices 
the company has made agreements with major wholesalers to provide product but cannot predict the effect on future volume and prices 
uspd has been and will continue to be affected by the competitive and changing nature of this industry 
accordingly  because of competition  the significance of relatively few major customers ie large wholesalers  distributors and chain stores  a rapidly changing market and uncertainty of timing of new product approvals  uspd sales volume and prices are subject to unforeseen fluctuation 
the generic industry in general is subject to similar fluctuations 
animal health division market conditions the animal health division s principal product  bmdr  is a feed additive used to promote growth and feed efficiency and prevent or treat diseases in swine and poultry 
ahd also sells other feed additives most of which are used in combination or sequentially with bmdr 
in and especially in the second quarter  results were negatively impacted by a steep rise in grain corn and wheat prices in the us the record high prices of these feed grains in the second quarter resulted in intense price competition and a reduction in the use of feed additives in general  including ahd products  primarily in the poultry market 
during the second half of feed grain prices were lower relative to the second quarter but were still historically high 
price and other competitive intensity has continued 
the company does not believe grain prices will remain high permanently but does believe that competitive conditions in the industry will remain intense for the foreseeable future 
the animal health division has reevaluated its business structure and practices to address the current industry conditions 
european operations the fluctuations of european currencies have and will continue to impact the company s european operations which comprised approximately of revenues in the year ended december  in addition  many european governments have enacted or are in the process of enacting mechanisms aimed at lowering the cost of pharmaceuticals 
currency fluctuations and governmental actions to reduce or not allow increases of prices have affected revenue 
the company cannot predict future currency fluctuations or future governmental pricing actions or their impact on the company s results 
liquidity and capital resources at december   stockholders equity was million compared to million and million at december   and  respectively 
the ratio of long term debt to equity was  and at december   and  respectively 
the decrease in stockholder s equity in primarily reflects the loss of the company and an decrease in the translation adjustment million due to the weakening of the dk and nok in working capital at december  was million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the current ratio was at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
significant fluctuations included accounts receivable being lower in by million resulting from substantially lower fourth quarter sales in the uspd and the european subsidiaries offset by a tax refund receivable of million recorded due to the domestic tax loss incurred by the company 
the current portion of long term debt was reduced as a result of an amendment to the company s long term debt agreement 
accrued expenses increased due primarily to accruals for severance related to management actions of approximately million 
all working capital elements also decreased in in us dollars as the functional currencies of the company s principal foreign subsidiaries  the danish krone and norwegian krone  weakened versus the us dollar as compared to by approximately and  respectively 
the approximate decrease due to currency translation was accounts receivable million  inventory million and accounts payable and accrued expenses million 
the company presently has various capital expenditure programs under way and planned including the expansion of the lier  norway facility 
in  the company s capital expenditures were million and in the company plans to spend approximately the same amount as in at december   the company had million available under existing short term unused lines of credit and million in cash 
in addition  the company has million available in europe under long term lines of credit and million available under an amended revolving credit facility 
the company believes that the combination of cash from operations and funds available under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to cover its currently planned operating needs 
a substantial portion of the company s short term and long term debt is at variable interest rates 
at december   the company has entered into interest rate agreements to fix the interest rates for million of the variable debt at plus the required margin through october the company is considering similar transactions to fix additional variable rate debt for specified periods to minimize the impact of future changes in interest rates 
the company s policy is to selectively enter into plain vanilla agreements to fix interest rates for existing debt if it is deemed prudent 
the million credit facility contained various financial covenants including the maintenance of minimum equity to assets  current and interest coverage ratios 
during as a result of charges for management actions and poor operating results the company requested and received a waiver for the required interest coverage ratio from the members of the bank syndicate which are participants in the credit facility 
the ratio required quarterly computation of compliance based on a trailing four quarters and accordingly  the company and the banks amended the agreement to determine compliance solely based on results compared to interest 
in addition the banks agreed to include in equity the stock subscription of the class b shareholder of million  convert existing debt tranches into a three and one half year revolving credit and adjust the amount of the credit facility to million 
the company s prospective liquidity and capital resources were strengthened in early when the company signed an agreement with al industrier whereby al industrier irrevocably agreed to purchase  shares of class b common for per share total proceeds approximately million 
concurrently the company announced that class a shareholders would be issued special rights to purchase one share of class a common stock for per share for every six shares of class a common currently held 
potential proceeds of approximately million 
if the class a rights are exercised the current ownership proportion between the class a and b shareholders would be maintained 
the distribution of the rights will be made with a prospectus 
the final details  terms and conditions of the rights have not been finalized  however  they are expected to be transferable and have a term expiring no later than november  al industrier s purchase of class b common stock will occur upon termination of the class a rights  but is not conditioned on the exercise of any of the class a rights 
the company cannot predict whether the class a rights will be exercised 
the stock subscription for the class b common will be completed by the fourth quarter of the subscription is supported by a letter of credit
