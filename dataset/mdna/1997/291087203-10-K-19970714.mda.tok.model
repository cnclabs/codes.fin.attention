since the emergence of the company from bankruptcy  management believes that it has been able to compete more effectively in the highly competitive consumer electronics and microwave oven industries in the united states by combining innovative approaches to the company s current product line such as value added promotions  and augmenting its product line with higher margin complimentary products 
the company also intends to engage in the marketing of distribution  sourcing and other services to third parties similar to the sales and marketing arrangements to be provided to daewoo and the sourcing and inspection services to be provided to cargil 
in addition  the company intends to undertake efforts to expand the international distribution of its products into areas where management believes low to moderately priced  dependable consumer electronics and microwave oven products will have a broad appeal 
the company has in the past and intends in the future to pursue such plans either on its own or by forging new relationships  including license arrangements  partnerships  joint ventures or strategic mergers and acquisitions of  or controlling interests in  companies in similar or complimentary businesses

short term liquidity

however  the adequacy of future cash flow from operations are dependent upon the company achieving its business plan 
during fiscal  the company reduced inventory levels approximately and executed cost reduction programs in both its us and foreign offices 
the company intends to further reduce inventory levels and shift a higher proportion of its sales to direct import thereby reducing its inventory and its needs for working capital 
in fiscal  products representing approximately of net revenues were directly imported from manufacturers to the company s customers

if the company does not obtain this objective  it may not have sufficient working capital to finance its sales plan 
it may be necessary for the company to margin or sell some of the ssg stock to adequately finance the company s operations

the company s liquidity is impacted by the seasonality of its business 
the company records the majority of its annual sales in the quarters ending september and december this requires the company to open significantly higher amounts of letters of credit during the quarters ending june and september  therefore significantly increasing the company s working capital needs during these periods 
additionally  the company receives the largest percentage of customer returns in the quarter ending march the higher level of returns during this period adversely impacts the company s collection activity during this period  and therefore its liquidity 
the company believes that the agreements with daewoo and cargil  as discussed above  and the arrangements it has implemented over the past twelve months concerning returned merchandise  should favorably impact the company s cash flow over their respective terms 
long term liquidity 
the company has discontinued certain lower margin lines of products and believes that this  together with the agreements covering its north american video business and the introduction of cinemasurround tm  can reverse the negative trends of operating losses reported in fiscal and fiscal additionally  the company believes that the ssg business offers significant growth potential 
in its first full quarter under emerson s management team  ssg reported record earnings and double digit sales growth as compared to the same period a year ago 
the revolving credit facility with the lender imposes financial covenants on the company which could materially affect its liquidity in the future 
the company intends on renegotiating with the lender to amend the us revolving credit facility to ensure continued compliance with all covenants 
alternatively  the company may seek replacement funding

hong kong operations a significant amount of the company s activities are conducted through its hong kong subsidiary  and the company s chairman  chief executive officer and president is resident in hong kong 
hong kong  formerly a british administered territory  reverted to the sovereignty of the people s republic of china on july  accordingly  there is a risk that the company s operations in hong kong may be interrupted or terminated

inflation and foreign currency except as disclosed above  neither inflation nor currency fluctuations had a significant effect on the company s results of operations during fiscal  fiscal or fiscal the company s exposure to currency fluctuations has been minimized by the use of us dollar denominated purchase orders  and by sourcing production in more than one country
