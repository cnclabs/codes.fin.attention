item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the liquidity and capital resources and the results of operations of the partnership for the periods indicated below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations through its operating partnerships  the partnership is principally engaged in the transportation of refined petroleum products including gasoline  jet fuel  diesel fuel  heating oil and kerosene 
the partnership s revenues are principally a function of the volumes of refined petroleum products transported by the partnership  which are in turn a function of the demand for refined petroleum products in the regions served by the partnership s pipelines and the tariffs or transportation fees charged for such transportation 
results of operations are affected by factors which include competitive conditions  demand for products transported  seasonality and regulation 
see business competition and other business considerations 
compared with revenue for the year ended december  was million  million or percent less than revenue of million for volume delivered during averaged  barrels per day   barrels per day or percent less than volume of  barrels per day delivered in the decline in revenue was related to decreases in gasoline deliveries  offset somewhat by increases in distillate  turbine fuel  liquefied petroleum gas and other petroleum product deliveries 
tariff rate increases implemented in and also had a favorable impact on revenues 
see tariff changes 
declines in gasoline deliveries were related in part to severe winter storms  particularly in the northeast  where ground traffic was curtailed during january and february 
increased canadian imports and the loss of business to other competing pipeline systems also reduced gasoline volumes transported by the partnership 
continued market growth in pennsylvania offset these volume declines to some extent 
distillate volumes rose in compared with primarily as the result of the colder winter in and heating oil inventory restocking occurring during the fourth quarter 
turbine fuel volumes were higher than last year on increased deliveries to newark  jfk and miami airports 
some turbine fuel volumes were lost to additional barging at pittsburgh and a decline in demand at laguardia airports 
costs and expenses during were million  million or percent greater than costs and expenses of million during during the second quarter  the partnership recorded a one time expense of million related to an employee early retirement and termination program 
in addition  increases in payroll overheads and professional fees related to the esop were offset by declines in payroll  taxes  power  supplies and travel 
other income expenses consist of interest income  interest and debt expense  and minority interests and other 
total other expenses declined million in as compared to this favorable variance is primarily related to a million gain on the sale of land no longer needed for the partnership s operations 
compared with revenue for the year ended december  was million  million or percent less than revenue of million for volume delivered during averaged  barrels per day   barrels per day or percent less than volume of  barrels per day delivered in the decline in revenue was related to decreases in gasoline and distillate deliveries  offset somewhat by increases in turbine fuel deliveries and the effect of tariff rate increases 
see tariff changes 
gasoline volumes declined as several competitive pipeline systems marginally expanded their capacity in resulting in some volume shifting to these systems 
in addition  a midwest refinery shutdown contributed to the decline 
these declines in gasoline volume were somewhat offset by increased market share in pennsylvania through the addition of a significant new customer during the distillate volume decline was primarily related to warmer weather throughout the northeast in the first quarter of marketers also opted to keep inventories at low levels  unlike the prior year when extensive summer inventory building occurred 
the midwest refinery closure also contributed to the decline in distillate volumes 
meanwhile  turbine fuel deliveries increased as both airline passenger and cargo traffic improved in the partnership s market areas during volume increases occurred at several major airport locations 
costs and expenses during were million  million or percent less than costs and expenses of million during declines in the use of outside services and power  along with declines in casualty loss expense  were partially offset by increases in payroll and employee benefit expenses 
other income expenses consist of interest income  interest and debt expense  and minority interests and other 
the partial repayment and refinancing of debt at lower interest rates in resulted in an interest expense decline of million in tariff changes in each of the years  and  certain of the operating partnerships filed increases in certain tariff rates 
the increases  at the time of filing  were projected to generate approximately million  million and million in additional revenue per year  respectively 
tariff increases filed in became effective on august  liquidity and capital resources the partnership s financial condition at december   and is highlighted in the following comparative summary liquidity and capital indicators as of december  current ratio to to to ratio of cash and temporary investments and trade receivables to current liabilities to to to working capital in thousands    ratio of total debt to total capital

the maximum amount available for distribution by buckeye to the partnership under the formula as of december  amounted to million 
the partnership is also entitled to receive cash distributions from everglades  btt and laurel 
capital expenditures at december   property  plant and equipment was approximately percent of total consolidated assets 
this compares to percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
capital expenditures are generally for expansion of the operating partnerships service capabilities and sustaining the operating partnerships existing operations 
capital expenditures by the partnership were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
projected capital expenditures for are approximately million 
planned capital expenditures include  among other things  renewal and replacement of several tank floors  roofs and seals  upgrades to field instrumentation and cathodic protection systems  installation and replacement of mainline pipe and valves  facility automation and various facility improvements that facilitate increased pipeline volumes 
capital expenditures are expected to increase primarily in response to increasingly rigorous governmental safety and environmental requirements as well as industry standards and the general partner s plan to automate certain facilities in order to more effectively control operating costs 
environmental matters the operating partnerships are subject to federal and state laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these regulations  as well as the partnership s own standards relating to protection of the environment  cause the operating partnerships to incur current and ongoing operating and capital expenditures 
during  the operating partnerships incurred operating expenses of million and capital expenditures of million for environmental matters 
capital expenditures of million for environmental related projects are included in the partnership s plans for expenditures  both capital and operating  relating to environmental matters are expected to continue and may be somewhat higher than in past years due to the partnership s commitment to maintain high environmental standards and to increasingly rigorous environmental laws 
certain operating partnerships or their predecessors have been named as a defendant in lawsuits or have been notified by federal or state authorities that they are a prp under federal laws or a respondent under state laws relating to the generation  disposal  or release of hazardous substances into the environment 
these proceedings generally relate to potential liability for clean up costs 
the total potential remediation costs to be borne by the operating partnerships relating to these clean up sites cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material 
with respect to each site  however  the operating partnership involved is one of several or as many as several hundred prps that would share in the total costs of clean up under the principle of joint and several liability 
the general partner believes that the generation  handling and disposal of hazardous substances by the operating partnerships and their predecessors have been in material compliance with applicable environmental and regulatory requirements 
in march  a landslide near freeport  pennsylvania caused a rupture to one of buckeye s pipelines which resulted in the release of approximately  gallons of petroleum products 
during  buckeye paid minimal claims and other charges related to this incident 
total claims paid as a result of this incident have amounted to million 
of this amount  million has been reimbursed by buckeye s insurance carriers 
buckeye is unable to estimate the total amount of future environmental clean up and other costs and liabilities that may be incurred in connection with this incident 
however  based on information currently available to it  buckeye believes that its net expense after insurance recoveries will not be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
see legal proceedings freeport landslide 
various claims for the cost of cleaning up releases of hazardous substances and for damage to the environment resulting from the activities of the operating partnerships or their predecessors have been asserted and may be asserted in the future under various federal and state laws 
although the partnership has made a provision for certain legal expenses relating to these matters  the general partner is unable to determine the timing or outcome of any pending proceedings or of any future claims and proceedings

the general partner implemented an expense reduction plan including  among other things  an early retirement and termination program  a freeze on salaried employee pay as well as fringe benefit reductions and eliminations 
this expense reduction plan  which was implemented in the second quarter of  is projected by the general partner to save more than million of annualized costs going forward 
during december  the board of directors of the general partner approved a proposed restructuring of the esop 
generally  the restructuring calls for the issuance of approximately million lp units by the partnership in exchange for a reduction in future expenses charged to the partnership 
the lp units would be held by a newly formed company whose common stock would be exchanged for the bac preferred stock held by the esop 
certain aspects of the restructuring are subject to approval by the unitholders
