funds from operations the company believes that to facilitate a clear understanding of the operating results of the company  funds from operations ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income 
the definition of ffo was clarified in the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit white paper  adopted by the nareit board of governors on march   as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization in each case only real estate related assets  less preferred stock dividends  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
previously  the company utilized a method which included adjustments to net income for amortization of loan costs and interest rate protection agreements and straight line rents 
ffo for the year ended december  has been restated in accordance with the clarified definition 
ffo should not be considered as a substitute for net income as an indication of the company s performance or as a substitute for cash flow as a measure of its liquidity 
the table below presents the calculations for ffo on a quarterly basis for the years ended december   and for the three months ended december september june march total in thousands funds from operations income before gain on sale of real estate and extraordinary items      real estate depreciation      joint venture income joint venture ffo provision for portfolio repositioning   preferred dividend requirement    total funds from operations      common dividends declared      weighted average number of common shares outstanding      funds from operations income before extraordinary charge      real estate depreciation      total funds from operations      common dividends declared      weighted average number of common shares outstanding      funds from operations net income      real estate depreciation      total funds from operations      common dividends declared      weighted average number of common shares outstanding      inflation the structure of the majority of the company s leases generally reduces the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation 
the company s leases generally provide for rent adjustments during their initial lease terms and during any option periods 
because net leases require tenants to pay for some or all operating expenses  property taxes  property repair and maintenance costs and insurance  some or all of the inflationary impact of these expenses will be borne by the tenants and not by the company 
an increase in inflation  however  could result in an increase in the company s borrowing costs and its general and administrative costs
