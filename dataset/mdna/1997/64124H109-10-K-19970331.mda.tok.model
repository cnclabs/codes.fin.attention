the company has incurred net losses since inception through december  of  and has to date generated only limited commercial revenues 
since the approval of the papnet r testing system by the fda  the company has been increasing the scale of its operations to commercial levels in the united states 
management of the company believes that its existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund the increase in the scale of the company s operations and to meet its cash requirements during the commercialization process

statements in this discussion which are not historical facts  including statements about the company s confidence and strategies and its expectations about demand for and acceptance of the papnet r testing system  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially due to a variety of factors which include  but are not limited to  the company s continuing negative cash flow  reliance on a single product  competition  dependence on key personnel  the impact on the company of its territorial license agreements  dependence on patents and proprietary technology  government regulation of both products and advertising  limited marketing and sales history  the impact of third party reimbursement decisions  risk of litigation and other risks detailed in the company s securities and exchange commission filings  including its form k 
results of operations the company s results of operations have fluctuated significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter  principally due to variations in the level of expenditures relating to its clinical trials  research projects  marketing and sales programs and international expansion 
the company s results of operations are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly and may continue to result in substantial losses 
from inception through december   the company has experienced negative gross margins due to the significant underutilization of its scanning and manufacturing operations which occurred as a result of the need to establish these capabilities prior to fda approval and the anticipated demand resulting from expansion of the company s marketing and sales activities since such approval 
improvement in the company s future gross margins will be dependent upon the level of commercial acceptance of the papnet r testing system 
the company expects that its costs and expenses will increase substantially during  compared to  as the company continues to expand its commercial operations  including its marketing  sales  manufacturing  slide processing  research and adminis trative activities  to meet the anticipated increase in market demand for papnet r testing  expand its clinical claims and develop enhancements to the papnet r testing system 
in addition  royalty payments will increase proportionate to increases in the company s revenues in the sales territories of the licensees 
to establish papnet r testing in the united states as the standard of care in pap smear analysis  the company is executing a three step sequential marketing approach that targets i its direct clients  the clinical laboratories that perform pap smear testing  ii gynecologists and those primary care physicians and other clinicians who take pap smears and can order papnet r testing and iii women  to encourage them to request papnet r testing or to agree to it if it is recommended by a clinician 
the company believes that significant revenue growth in the united states depends upon effective marketing to all three target audiences 
during  the company made significant progress in building laboratory distribution and physician awareness in the united states  increasing the number of laboratories equipped to perform papnet r testing from to  and increasing the total number of laboratories offering papnet r testing including laboratories that have entered into reference arrangements from to in addition  the company increased its us sales organization calling on clinicians and laboratories from to accordingly  the company initiated its direct to consumer advertising in august of  while continuing to market to laboratories and clinicians 
the company is also marketing to insurers  managed care organizations and other third party payers concerning reimbursement for papnet r testing  and expects to increase its expenditures in this area during the company also continued to expand its international laboratory distribution in by december   papnet r testing was available in countries worldwide and was available through laboratories in europe and south africa and laboratories in australia 
in asia  the company continued to expand its business in hong kong  taiwan and mainland china 
by december   the company had received slide processing revenue from laboratories and hospitals in these countries 
in addition  in september  the company entered into a co promotion agreement with the women s healthcare group of the parke davis division of warner lambert company 
according to the terms of that agreement  members of the parke davis field sales force present papnet r testing promotional materials to physicians when making sales calls regarding parke davis loestrin r oral contraceptives 
although the company does not expect that parke davis s activities will have a significant direct impact on sales  the company believes that this program has increased awareness of papnet r testing in the clinician s office 
activities under the agreement began in late october and are expected to continue into early the company s sales and marketing efforts to date in the united states have generated considerable awareness about papnet r testing among pathologists  cytotechnologists  gynecologists and women 
the company believes support and interest has been highest among women 
medical specialities  however  are often reluctant to change clinical practice methods and procedures  and early stage resistance is being experienced in the adoption of papnet r testing 
among gynecologists and pathologists there has been  in general  a slow adoption of the papnet r technology and some reluctance to use it even if a woman inquires about or requests the test 
the company believes that this is due to several factors  including controversy within the medical profession about the public health consequences of pap smear false negatives  the relative cost of papnet r testing to the pap smear  limited reimbursement by third party payers and confusion in the marketplace about alternative technologies for cervical cancer screening 
in late and the first quarter of  the company initiated medical and other communications designed to address each of these considerations 
interest expense is expected to increase in the future as the company borrows to fund expansion of its manufacturing  slide processing and marketing capabilities  including the installation of additional papnet r scanning stations at the company s scanning centers 
it is expected that this increase will continue to be substantially offset during by interest income from the investment of the company s cash 
the company expects that its interest income will decline in  compared to  because of the significant use of cash in and the anticipated use of cash in the impact of inflation and changing prices on the company s revenues and costs has not been significant

in addition  the company s cost of sales  research and development and general and administrative expenses also increased during  although at a slower rate than sales and marketing expenses

liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations since its inception primarily by the issuance of equity securities  sales of papnet r testing system services  funds received for the territorial license agreements prior to  interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and proceeds from notes  bank loans and equipment leasing arrangements 
the company s combined cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december   a decrease of  from december  during  the company used  for operating activities  primarily to finance the company s loss  and used  for investing activities  while generating net cash of  from financing activities 
in addition  the effect of exchange rate changes on cash was  which accounted for the remaining change to the company s cash balance

changes to the components of working capital and other items accounted for the remainder of the net change in cash and cash equivalents 
the significant increase in cash used for operations during and  when compared with earlier years  is primarily the result of higher expenses for the initiation and expansion of the company s sales and marketing programs in the united states and overseas  including the direct to consumer advertising campaign  higher expenses for research and clinical development to support product enhancements and the company s fda premarket approval application and other fda related activities  expansion of the company s slide processing and manufacturing capabilities in the united states  the netherlands  hong kong and israel  and expansion of the administrative infrastructure needed to support commercial activities following approval of the papnet r testing system by the fda and the additional costs of being a public company 
as of december   the company s debt and capital lease obligations totaled  the amount of combined payments of the outstanding debt and capital lease obligations  including related interest on capital leases  for the five years succeeding december  is approximately  in   in   in   in and  in the company s commitments for payments under non cancelable operating leases for the five years succeeding december  are approximately  in   in   in   in and  in the company anticipates that its use of cash will be substantial for the foreseeable future 
in particular  the company anticipates that expenditures will continue to increase substantially in due to the cost of the marketing launch of the papnet r testing system in the united states  the increased cost of marketing and sales programs in overseas markets and the expansion of research and development programs for additional clinical indications and claims 
the company estimates that  during  it will invest approximately million for working capital purposes and approximately million for capital expenditures and leasehold improvements  primarily associated with the manufacture or purchase of papnet r scanning stations and related equipment  papnet r review stations and facility leasehold improvements 
although funding for these capital expenditures is expected to be available out of the company s cash resources  management of the company believes that it may be desirable for the company to finance certain of such capital expenditures through additional debt or capital lease obligations 
during  the company entered into a loan agreement with an equipment financing company to provide the company with a  line of credit to finance certain of the company s equipment purchases  primarily papnet r scanners and related equipment 
during  the company borrowed  under the agreement  with loan terms of months and with a final payment in the amount equal to of the original principal amount of such loan and with an annual effective interest rate of 
any future borrowings under this line of credit will have similar loan terms provided  however  the annual interest rate of will be adjusted by the change in the weekly average of the interest rates of five year us treasury securities  as published by the federal reserve  from the week ending october  to the week preceding each future loan commencement date

the company is required to maintain certain financial covenants throughout the duration of the loan 
the agreement stipulates that additional funding can be denied in the event of a material adverse change in the financial condition  operation or prospects of the company 
the loan commitment expires on december  there can be no assurance  however  that these financings  or any other financings  will ultimately be obtained by the company or  if they are obtained  that the terms thereof will not change or will be reasonable 
the company anticipates that its current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its future operating requirements for at least two years 
the company does not expect to generate a positive internal cash flow in the foreseeable future due to the expected increases in capital expenditures  working capital requirements and ongoing losses during the next year  including the expected cost of commercializing the papnet r testing system 
the company may need to arrange additional equity or debt financing for the future operation of its business

the company plans to invest excess funds in short term instruments  including money market funds 
during  the company s operating results reflect foreign exchange losses of  and its financial position as of december  reflects a foreign currency translation effect of  as discussed in detail below  the company is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because i it has investments in its foreign subsidiaries  ii it derives a significant portion of its revenues and incurs a significant portion of its costs and expenses in the local currencies of the countries in which its subsidiaries are transacting business and iii it finances the operations of such subsidiaries substantially through dollar denominated intercompany loans which are recorded on the books of the subsidiaries in their respective local currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates have not had a material impact on the company s revenues or costs and expenses  but have affected the value of its equity investments and intercompany loans 
from inception through december   the company s sales of papnet r testing services for commercial use have been derived principally from foreign sources 
although the company expects united states revenues to increase faster than non united states revenues  the company anticipates that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its net sales as it executes its plan to establish commercial use of the papnet r testing system on a worldwide basis 
in addition  neuromedical systems  inc  the united states parent company  has provided a significant portion of the financing required for its subsidiaries in the netherlands  australia  israel and hong kong through intercompany loans and equity investments denominated in united states dollars 
as a result of its international operations and its current financing approach  the company s operating results are subject to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates of the currencies in which its foreign operations conduct business versus the united states dollar 
the company is exposed to gains and losses with respect to australian dollars and several european currencies predominately dutch guilders because the company s subsidiaries invoice for slide processing services and incur costs and expenses in local currencies 
in addition  although the company s israeli subsidiary maintains its books in us dollars  certain of its expenses are incurred in israeli shekels and are subject to exchange fluctuations 
the revenues and expenses of the company s hong kong subsidiary are in hong kong dollars  the value of which is presently tied to the united states dollar and  therefore  are not currently subject to material fluctuations 
there can be no assurance  however  that the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the hong kong dollar will not fluctuate in the future 
to date  the company has not implemented a program to hedge its foreign currency risk  but may do so in the future 
at december   the company had available united states net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  that will expire in the years through and cumulative deductible temporary differences of approximately  the company also has foreign net operating losses of approximately  that are available to offset the separate taxable incomes of certain foreign subsidiaries 
these losses may be carried forward indefinitely 
in addition  at december   the company also had approximately  of united states research and development credits available which will expire in the years through the tax reform act of enacted a complex set of rules limiting the potential utilization of united states net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards in periods following a corporate ownership change 
in general  an ownership change is deemed to occur if the percentage of stock of a loss corporation owned actually  constructively and  in some cases  deemed by one or more stockholders has increased by more than percentage points over the lowest percentage of such stock owned during a three year testing period 
as a result of changes in the company s ownership  the utilization of a substantial portion of the company s available united states net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards will be subject to annual limitations 
it is management s belief  however  that  since such annual limitations are determined based on the value of the company immediately prior to the ownership changes  a significant portion of the carryforwards will be available annually should the company become profitable in future tax years 
on december   the company was served with a summons and complaint in an action entitled herbst et al 
v 
neuromedical systems  inc et al  in the supreme court of the state of new york

on february   the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint and on november   the new york state supreme court issued an opinion dismissing all of the plaintiff s claims that the company and certain officers and directors committed fraud and other improper actions that allegedly diminished the value of the warrants plaintiffs claim they are entitled to receive 
the court denied the company s motion to dismiss plaintiffs breach of contract claim  and plaintiffs continue to seek million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
the company intends to continue to vigorously defend this action

in the lawsuit  the company alleges that neopath willfully misappropriated the company s patented technology and used such technology in neopath s autopap r system 
the company also alleges that neopath falsely characterized and made misleading comparisons to consumers and securities analysts of the autopap r system and the company s papnet r testing system 
neopath has denied all allegations and  in addition  it has filed counter claims against the company seeking damages and injunctive relief for false advertising and unfair competition 
in the counter claims  neopath alleges that statements made by the company characterizing the performance of the papnet r testing system  and its effectiveness relative to neopath s autopap r system  as well as other statements  are false and misleading and constitute misrepresentations 
the company believes that neopath s assertions are without merit 
although the duration  costs and ultimate outcome of this lawsuit are unknown  the company expects that the costs of pursuing this lawsuit will be significant during
