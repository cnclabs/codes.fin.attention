industries for which the company believes its printers are particularly well suited include shipping and package delivery  retail distribution and point of sale  healthcare  manufacturing  financial services and governmental identification 
the company currently focuses its sales efforts in these markets  although it continues to explore the potential for new markets in which it can apply its expertise in the design and manufacture of low cost thermal printers 
eltron s objective is to establish itself as a leading supplier of thermal printers and related accessories designed for use in on demand print applications 
the company believes it is able to maintain a competitive advantage through i its understanding of its markets and the positioning of its products as value leaders  as measured by their low cost and high quality  ii its concentration on the timely introduction of new products  as demonstrated by the more than products eltron has brought to market since its inception in january  iii the design of its products  which are precision tooled  contain few parts  are easy to assemble and use little direct labor  resulting in efficient production at low cost  and iv its use of high quality components to produce reliable products 
industry overview eltron s products are designed to meet a wide range of customer needs  with the majority of its printers and related products sold into the automatic identification data collection and the custom plastic card printer industries 
these industries are discussed as follows automatic identification data collection industry 
automatic identification data collection refers to the automatic recognition and processing of data without the need for manual input 
currently  this is accomplished through the computerized reading and writing of information encrypted in bar codes  magnetic stripes and smart chips  with bar coding the predominant technology 
a bar code consists of a series of bars and spaces of specified widths  groupings of which represent specific numeric or alphanumeric characters 
a unique bar code can be affixed to permit rapid and accurate identification of any number of variables relating to any item to be tracked or managed 
with bar code data collection systems  workers are able  with limited training  to collect data by scanning bar codes and to input this information into computer databases in real time 
bar coding is highly reliable compared to conventional input methods 
this technology eliminates human error that occurs during manual input of information and results in the reduction of labor and process costs 
initially  automatic identification data collection technology was applied to the transportation and retail industries 
over time  automatic identification data collection technology has gained wider acceptance and is now regularly used in industries ranging from manufacturing to medical research 
bar code label printers use a number of printing technologies commonly used in the conventional computer printer industry 
these technologies are direct thermal  thermal transfer  impact and laser 
as the cost of automatic identification data collection technology has decreased and customer acceptance increased  the applications of this technology have diversified and created a number of new markets 
according to an industry study  the bar code label printer market is projected to grow from an estimated billion in to billion in moreover  as information technology has increasingly come into use  retailers  manufacturers  and distributors in a large number of industries have issued compliance standards requiring that suppliers provide products with bar coded information affixed 
while a number of automatic identification data collection applications allow for preprinted bar coded information to be included in package design  a significant number of applications require the encoding of variable data in unique bar code labels on demand  thus making the use of preprinted bar code information impractical 
generally  bar coded labels or tickets may either be preprinted off site by a third party or on site by the user where the bar code label will be used 
on demand printing is required when there is a need for variable data that is not known until shortly before a label must be printed and used 
situations requiring on demand printing include labels that must indicate addresses  dates of manufacture  unique serial or purchase order numbers  product ingredients or nutritional information  accurate weights  expiration dates  and other similar information that cannot be effectively produced off site 
the custom plastic card industry 
a new thermal print process  thermal dye sublimation  has recently become commercially viable for applications that call for color printing on pvc plastic 
this capability has given rise to an industry focused on the on site creation of full color  photographic quality plastic cards 
these cards can typically be created in less than one minute for under one dollar  while the user waits 
traditional photographic processes are both more expensive and take more time 
personalized card applications such as state driver s licenses  school and work identification cards  security access cards and financial transaction cards are  in the opinion of the company  well suited to benefit from this technology 
bar codes  smart chip and magnetic stripe encoding can be used to record such personal data as health records  financial transactions  security access codes  and vital statistics 
while the use of this technology is relatively new  the company believes that the increased security and utility of personalized cards is creating an industry capable of high growth 
eltron s sales of card printers increased more than to million in additional market opportunities 
the company believes that there is a growing number of printing applications being developed in various industries which require multiple site  on demand printing 
the company believes that  by virtue of its ability to manufacture compact printers at low cost  it is well positioned to benefit from this trend 
the company believes that it can build on its core design competencies to address these new markets for on demand printing 
business strategy as a result of its combination of low price  high quality and service  the company believes that it is a leading supplier of thermal printers and related accessories 
utilizing management s experience in the automatic identification data collection and computer peripheral industries  the company is expanding its line of quality printers and related accessories to meet the needs of additional markets and to position itself as a price and quality leader 
the company s objectives are to enhance its position in the automatic identification data collection industry  to establish itself as a leading supplier of on demand printers designed for use in additional industries  such as plastic card printing  and to distribute related supplies 
the company seeks to o capitalize on market understanding to establish value leadership in profitable niches 
the company believes that the success of its current products is the result of its understanding of customer needs and competitive market forces 
eltron plans to continue to assess its position relative to market needs and intends to sustain its competitive advantage through intelligent product positioning and market understanding 
the company also intends to broaden its opportunities by taking eltron s products to new markets and industries which provide opportunities for on demand printers  allowing it to take advantage of its engineering and technology competencies 
eltron concentrates on providing high quality at the lowest price  rather than competing solely on product features 
o maintain aggressive product design cycle 
eltron has demonstrated its commitment to aggressive product design cycles by bringing to market more than products since january the company s objective is to achieve product design cycles that are shorter than those of its competitors 
the company believes that a key factor in developing and maintaining a competitive advantage is this ability to rapidly transform a product concept into a manufactured product 
the company believes that reduced design cycles allow it to better react to ever changing market needs 
o pursue simplified product design 
as part of its low cost  high quality strategy  eltron has developed products which  by virtue of their design  can be produced at a low cost using little direct labor 
eltron s products are precision tooled  designed to be easily assembled and contain few parts 
this design philosophy has guided the company from its inception 
for example  eltron s companion printer requires no manufacturing adjustments  contains four moving parts and takes approximately minutes to assemble 
as a result  the company is able to produce reliable  high quality printers at low cost 
this design philosophy will continue to be a priority for new product development 
o ensure quality and product reliability 
although the company has sought to establish itself as a price leader  the company believes that it must provide reliable  high quality products and service to develop and sustain a competitive advantage 
as a result of the cost advantages it has achieved through its product designs  eltron has been able to incorporate high quality components into its products at comparatively low cost 
eltron s commitment to quality and reliability is also evidenced by the company s iso certification in november the majority of eltron s products are warranted for a full year 
the company believes that it has not experienced significant warranty claims to date because of the simplicity of its product design strategy  the relatively small number of moving parts in its printers and the high quality components it uses 
the company believes that the strategy summarized above will enable it to compete in its existing markets and to develop new markets 
to take advantage of the benefits that the company believes will flow from pursuing the strategy  the company plans to implement it in the following areas o expand presence and products in automatic identification data collection markets 
while the company believes that penetration of the retail market with automatic identification data collection products is significant  eltron also believes that the majority of enterprises in the healthcare and industrial markets are not yet employing automatic identification data collection technology and that markets outside of the united states are less saturated than its domestic markets 
the company s strategy is to expand the potential applications of automatic identification data collection technology in these sectors by continuing to reduce the price of its products through design and manufacturing efficiencies  thereby increasing the affordability of automatic identification data collection equipment for those who may not have used it previously due to cost 
the company also believes that its wide range of product offerings provides an advantage in emerging markets in latin america and asia where automatic identification data collection has only recently been introduced 
o penetrate plastic card markets 
the company targeted the plastic card market through the acquisition of privilege sa in the first quarter of the company believes that  by applying eltron s design philosophy and manufacturing techniques to privilege s products  the cost of these products can be substantially reduced  improving its price leadership position in the custom plastic card market 
the company also believes that providing user friendly plastic card printers at a lower price point may increase demand within the custom plastic card market 
o identify and enter new markets 
the company believes that there is a growing number of printing applications being developed in various industries which require multiple site  on demand printing 
the company believes that  by virtue of its ability to manufacture relatively compact printers at low cost  it is well positioned to benefit from this trend 
the company believes that it can build on its design competencies to address these new markets for on demand printing 
o leverage distribution channels 
as the company s installed base of bar code printers grows  the company believes that it has the opportunity to expand its sales of supplies to serve those printers  as well as sales of new upgrade and replacement printers 
over the life of a printer  the cost of supplies can exceed by several times the initial cost of the printer 
the company distributes its products through multiple sales channels  which include value added resellers  systems integrators  original equipment manufacturers and independent distributors  and the company s own sales force 
the company continually seeks to strengthen its relationships with the resellers of its products and to build awareness and demand for its products among end users 
moreover  the company believes it can capitalize on strong relationships in its channels to offer more products and new products to end users at lower incremental selling and administrative costs 
o expand international sales 
from its inception eltron has emphasized a global sales strategy 
in the years ended december   and  the company s sales outside of the united states totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   the company distributed its products in countries  and as of december  that number had increased to more than countries 
the company s objective is to be a worldwide supplier of a wide range of competitively priced on demand printers 
the company s key markets bar codes are currently used to increase productivity and efficiency in an increasing number of industries 
the company s key markets include the package delivery  retail  healthcare  manufacturing  financial services and security industries 
package delivery 
the package delivery industry is increasing its use of automatic identification data collection technology to track packages from pickup to delivery 
examples of companies that have implemented this technology in their operations include united parcel service  federal express  roadway express and the us postal service  some of which provide their customers with shipping systems consisting of computers  weighing scales and bar code label printers 
bar code labels are printed at the shipping location and encoded with tracking information 
the label is scanned by the package pickup driver with the data then stored in a portable data collection terminal 
the data is either transmitted or later downloaded to the main computer system 
the package is then delivered to the local distribution center for sorting by destination 
information encoded on the package label facilitates its continued tracking 
the encoded information is used again to sort and track the package when it arrives at its destination 
portable penpad computer terminals are used to record the recipient s name and time of delivery  and this information is then available to the sender for delivery verification 
retail 
the retail industry was one of the first to utilize automatic identification data collection technology 
an individual stock keeping unit sku is encoded with product identification information 
this information is printed on the product container or onto a label or tag 
the encoded product information is then scanned at the check out terminal  expediting the check out process and reducing the errors incurred in entering the information manually 
an added benefit of bar coding product information is that data contained on the sku is transmitted to the main computer system for automatic inventory analysis 
in addition  in store inventory can easily be determined through the use of portable terminals and scanning devices 
portable label printers can also be used to create substitute labels or tags with incomplete or missing sku information  and for creating shelf tags 
healthcare 
the use of automatic identification data collection technology in the healthcare industry is growing rapidly 
examples of applications in healthcare include patient admission  laboratory specimen identification  pharmacy labels and dispensing of medication 
once patients have been admitted to a treatment facility  their records  procedures  medications  and charges can be captured by entering cost data and patient information into a computer 
bar coded wristbands and file labels are created by a label printer 
using automatic identification data collection  hospitals and healthcare systems can streamline accounting functions and improve bottom line results 
through the use of the integrated automatic identification data collection system  patient billing information can be captured at the point of delivery and continuously entered in a central computer  thereby reducing billing delays and errors 
at a nurse s station  bar coded labels can be printed for the encoding of each specimen at the time it is collected from the patient  thereby eliminating potential input errors 
prescribed medication with the patient s identification encoded on a label can be scanned prior to being administered to ensure accuracy 
patient medication requirements can be entered into a central computer and transmitted to the pharmacy  where bar coded prescription labels are created and patient information automatically cross checked at the time the prescription is filled 
this allows for accurate tracking of patient medication  reducing the possibility of costly and potentially fatal errors 
bar coded specimen and tracking sheets can then be sent to the laboratory for analysis 
additional bar coded labels are printed  if required  for the various test locations within the laboratory 
the specimens are scanned as they enter and leave each test station 
analyses are sent to the central computer for transmission to the patient s doctor 
the use of automatic identification data collection within the laboratory has greatly reduced the number of errors in tracking and reporting test analyses and increased speed and accuracy in the billing process 
the company believes that  because of the large number of samples and the significant liability associated with labeling errors in certain healthcare applications  an incentive exists for the increased use of automatic identification data collection technology in the healthcare sector 
the company believes that the adoption of bar code technology is a means of reducing keystroke or handwriting error in the medical labeling process 
in the doctor s office  automatic identification data collection can be used to verify insurance eligibility  track patient history files  and encode laboratory specimens 
the benefits to the doctor are improved timeliness of test results  fewer errors and more accurate billing 
manufacturing 
the increased efficiencies associated with bar coded information are especially apparent in the industrial sector 
information encoded on components can be tracked for a variety of purposes  including assembly of components  tracking of product  work in progress  inventory control and warranty information 
the company believes that the industrial market has not been significantly penetrated  as many small and mid sized firms have not yet employed automatic identification data collection technology 
financial services 
management believes that new technologies exist which can potentially increase the utility of plastic cards 
these technologies include memory chip or smart cards  high density magnetic strip encoding and high density bar codes  all of which enable plastic cards to provide more than an account number 
this increased storage capacity is creating new applications for plastic cards such as electronic purse or debit cards 
the company believes that this increased transaction capability will create an increased need for security 
eltron s plastic card printers provide the ability to print bar codes  color photographs and graphics  encode magnetic stripes  and read and write to smart chips  all in the same process at a relatively low cost 
security and access control 
a growing number of firms are implementing access control systems that feature encoded identification badges 
these badges may be used to unlock a door in a card access control system or as a form of identification with corporate name  logo  and individual name and photograph 
the plastic card printer and software application are the two main components that allow for complete personalization of cards on demand 
access control is often required in educational environments  primarily universities  for access to dormitories  cafeterias  libraries and other facilities 
healthcare institutions control access to certain areas where  for example  prescription drugs are stored

research and product development the company devotes significant resources to new product development and has established an aggressive product development schedule 
since its inception  eltron has sought to shorten the time required to take a product concept and turn it into a manufactured product 
eltron refers to this period as the product design cycle 
by focusing on reducing the product design cycle  eltron has been able to introduce more than products since its inception in at december   the company employed individuals in new product design  engineering and development 
eltron provides its engineering department with computer aided design tools to improve design efficiency and allow the department to compress product development cycles 
eltron engineers design all firmware  software  mechanisms  mechanical parts and enclosures used in its printers and other products 
sales and marketing sales 
the company targets specific markets by identifying channels of distribution that enhance its exposure to potential customers 
because the company s products are frequently combined with products from other manufacturers to form an integrated system  the company believes that it is more effective to sell principally through multiple distributors and resellers with defined market niche expertise and presence  as well as to end users 
the company believes that by forming relationships with value added resellers  distributors  systems integrators and original equipment manufacturers who supply various submarkets and types of end users  serve customers or have in place sales and distribution channels that identify new customers and sales opportunities  the company is able to reach end users throughout the world in a variety of industries 
the company may  however  designate a customer as a key account when purchases of company products reach certain levels 
key accounts are directly managed by company sales personnel rather than through the company s other distribution channels 
in the united states  the company sells primarily through over value added resellers and systems integrators 
these value added resellers and systems integrators tend to specialize in specific industries and sell in relatively small geographic areas 
the company does not grant specific territories to its domestic resellers 
the company works to ensure the expertise of its resellers and has made an effort to ensure that they are knowledgeable regarding the company s products 
at december   the company employed individuals in sales  marketing and customer service 
eltron s internal sales force is responsible for expanding and improving the sales volume generated by its sales channels 
the sales force is also responsible for communicating the company s capabilities to existing and potential customers  coordinating orders  and solving application and implementation challenges for resellers and end users 
the sales group also includes a customer service department that coordinates and processes orders and seeks to ensure customer satisfaction through the timely communication of product information 
outside the united states  the company sells through more than distributors located in countries who purchase  warehouse and sell printers  accessories  supplies and other integrated system components 
eltron s international distributors cover specific countries throughout the world 
these distributors have been qualified by the company and are encouraged to attend annual training seminars at the company s headquarters 
the company enters into written distribution agreements with most of its distributors  which typically may be canceled by either party upon days notice 
the company currently employs individuals outside of the united states in sales and marketing functions 
these individuals are located at regional sales offices in reading  england  varades  france  billancourt  france  floersheim  germany  and singapore 
the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral for its customers payment obligations 
the company maintains reserves for potential credit losses  to date such losses have been within its expectations 
the company extends credit to its domestic customers for a term of days and  in accordance with local business practices  may extend credit to its international customers for a term of up to days 
marketing 
the company s marketing operations include product management  market research  product development  and marketing services 
the product management group initiates the development of new products and product enhancements to meet customer needs  and manages product introductions and positioning 
the company s market research and product development group focuses on strategic planning and market definition and analyzes the company s competitive strengths and weaknesses 
this group identifies and evaluates market opportunities for current  planned and potential products  and gathers and analyzes competitive and market intelligence 
the marketing services group is responsible for advertising and public relations activity 
this group creates advertising  brochures and product documentation  manages trade show exhibits  and places articles highlighting applications of eltron s products in trade and industry publications 
the group also includes a product support team that provides  among other things  a hotline staffed by technical personnel 
backlog the company strives to ship customer orders within days of receipt of an order  and typically orders are shipped within that period  except in cases where the customer requests that orders be sent at a particular time to meet customer needs 
aside from long term orders received from ups which totaled slightly greater than million at december   backlog is not meaningful to the company s business 
for information concerning orders from ups  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
competition competition in the bar code industry is intense 
many companies are engaged in the design  manufacture and marketing of automatic identification data collection equipment 
the company considers its direct competition to be the providers of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing systems and supplies designed for the on demand printing environment 
to a lesser extent the company also competes with companies engaged in the design  manufacture and marketing of standard computer and label printers 
there are a number of factors involved in the manufacture  marketing and sale of on demand thermal and thermal transfer printers  such as price  product quality  product reliability  market position  sales channels  product innovation  time to market  service and technical support 
the company believes that it competes favorably with respect to these factors 
the company competes against several companies across its product line  as no one competitor offers the breadth of products that the company offers 
in the low cost  lower performance products  eltron s principal competitors are cognitive solutions  a subsidiary of dh technology  inc  tokyo electric company  and microcom 
datamax and zebra technologies have also recently announced products to compete in the low cost  lower performance markets 
in the higher performance printer markets  eltron s principal competitors are datamax corporation  intermec corporation  a subsidiary of western atlas  monarch marking systems  a subsidiary of paxar  inc  sato  tokyo electric company  and zebra technologies 
each of these companies manufactures a series of printers that competes with one or more of the company s products in the higher performance printer category 
several of these companies  and others against which the company competes  have substantially greater financial  technical and other resources than the company 
various other methods of bar code printing exist 
the company continually assesses these technologies to determine if they are suitable for low cost bar code printing 
currently  the company believes that direct thermal and thermal transfer print technology provide the best low cost solutions for its target markets 
if other technologies were to evolve or become available to the company  it is possible that those technologies would be incorporated into its products if management believed they were suitable for low cost bar code printing 
alternatively  if such technologies were to evolve or become available to the company s competitors  the company s products may become obsolete  which would have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations 
the company s principal competitors in the plastic card market include datacard  inc  a privately held manufacturer of transaction card production systems and plastic cards  and fargo  inc  a private manufacturer of color card systems 
intellectual property and proprietary rights the company regards portions of the hardware designs and operating software incorporated into its products as proprietary and attempts to protect them with a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and similar means 
the company has patent and pending patents pertaining to its products 
however  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use  to the company s detriment  information that the company regards as proprietary 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries do not afford the same protection to the company s proprietary rights as do united states laws 
there can be no assurance that legal protections relied upon by the company to protect its proprietary position will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technologies 
the company currently holds united states trademarks on the company s eii  eltron  rjs  privilege and russet logos and the name eltron 
the company actively protects these trademarks  which it believes have significant goodwill value 
eltron relies on a combination of trade secrets  copyright laws and contractual rights to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products 
the company does not believe that legal protections afforded to its intellectual property rights are critical to its success 
employees since its inception  the company has sought to obtain the trust and respect of its employees by providing open communications  a clean and safe workplace and competitive benefits 
the company believes that the continued dedication of the company s employees is important to its long term growth and success 
as of december   the company employed persons  of which were full time and were part time 
of these employees  were employed in sales and marketing functions  were employed in engineering and manufacturing functions  while the remaining employees performed general and administrative functions 
none of the company s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the company considers its relationship with its employees to be excellent

industries for which the company believes its printers are particularly well suited include shipping and package delivery  retail distribution and point of sale  healthcare  manufacturing  financial services security and access control  and governmental licensing 
the company currently focuses its sales efforts in these markets  although it continues to explore the potential for new markets in which it can apply its expertise in the design and manufacture of high quality  low cost thermal printers 
eltron is currently seeking to expand its line of quality printers and related accessories to meet the needs of a broad range of end users and to be positioned as a price and value leader 
management is engaged in efforts to accomplish this expansion through both internal development efforts and strategic acquisitions and alliances 
in the first quarter of  the company enhanced its market position through the acquisition of privilege  sa privilege and a merger with rjs  incorporated rjs 
privilege  located in varades  france  is a manufacturer of plastic card printers 
rjs  located in monrovia  california  is a manufacturer of high speed thermal bar code printers  bar code verifiers and verified printing systems 
the acquisition of rjs has been accounted for as a pooling of interests for financial reporting purposes 
the accompanying financial statements are based on the assumption that the two companies were combined at the beginning of the year  and all financial statements for prior periods presented have been restated to give effect to the combination 
in connection with the acquisition  rjs changed its fiscal year end from september to december  which conforms to eltron s year end 
the consolidated financial statements for all years prior to have not been restated to reflect rjs s change in fiscal year 
the and financial statements include rjs s results of operations on a september fiscal year end basis and eltron s results of operations on a december calendar year basis 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information derived from the company s consolidated statements of income expressed as percentages of sales and expressed as a percentage increase or decrease relative to the results of the previous period

this increase in sales can be attributed to an increase in the number of printers sold resulting from wider market acceptance of the company s established lines of bar code printers  increased acceptance of its recently introduced plastic card printers  as well as higher than anticipated demand from the company s largest customer  united parcel service and its designated marketing partners ups

sales were also aided by the acquisition of privilege  effective january   which accounted for million of the sales increase 
throughout  sales were enhanced by increased sales to either ups or its designated sub contractors  which contributed approximately million and million to sales in and  respectively 
although the company had outstanding orders from ups in excess of million as of december   there is no obligation on the part of ups to place any further orders with eltron 
the company has derived a significant portion of its revenues from ups and may in the future be dependent on ups  or other significant customers  the loss of any one of which could materially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
no customer other than ups contributed greater than of the company s net sales during gross profit for totaled million  an increase of million or over gross profit for as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased to in from in this decrease can be attributed primarily to an increase in sales to high volume customers and oems which are typically transacted at a price which yields a lower gross margin  although the incremental selling costs associated with these transactions are generally less than those associated with a non oem sale 
management currently believes that sales to high volume and oem customers may increase in the future and that  as a result  the gross margin exhibited in may not necessarily be maintained in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were and for and  respectively 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars to million up from million in these increases primarily reflect sales and marketing efforts focused on the company s domestic and european sales channels 
the company currently anticipates that selling  general and administrative expense will increase in future quarters but may decrease as a percentage of sales 
the actual amount spent will depend on a variety of factors  including the company s level of operations  and the number of new markets the company attempts to enter 
research and development expenses increased in to million  up from million in this increase related primarily to increased efforts to develop new products 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses increased to in  from in the previous year

operating results were also impacted by legal and other costs associated with business combinations  either attempted or completed  in which totaled approximately million and the expensing of in process technology valued at million in connection with the purchase of privilege sa these costs are related to specific transactions and therefore are non recurring 
net interest income totaled  in  a decrease of  over net interest income of  for the previous year

in january  eltron entered into a letter of understanding with respect to a revolving credit facility with a bank 
as defined in the letter of understanding  the revolving credit facility would allow eltron to borrow up to million on an unsecured basis 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility would bear interest at the bank s prime rate

cautionary statements and risk factors several of the matters discussed in this document contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
factors associated with the forward looking statements which could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated appear below 
in addition to the other information contained in this document  readers should carefully consider the following cautionary statements and risk factors 
dependence on significant customer for the years ended december   and  ups or its designated marketing partners  accounted for approximately million  million and million  respectively  of the company s sales 
there is no obligation on the part of ups to place any further orders with the company 
the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows are substantially dependent on sales to ups  the loss or reduction of which would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations 
ability to sustain growth rate in  and  the company achieved annual sales growth of  and  respectively 
in the opinion of management  these growth percentages can primarily be attributed to initial market penetration by the company 
management believes that as the company further penetrates its target markets and matures  it may not be able to sustain its historic growth rate 
shareholders and investors should not rely on the continuation of the company s historic growth rate in making their investment decisions 
management of rapidly changing business  acquisitions the company has experienced recent rapid growth and is subject to the risks inherent in the rapid expansion and growth of a business enterprise 
this significant growth has placed and  if sustained  will continue to place  a substantial strain on the operational  administrative and financial resources of the company and has resulted in an increase in the level of responsibility for the company s existing and new management personnel 
to manage its growth effectively  the company will be required to continue to implement and improve its operating and financial systems and to expand  train and manage its employee base 
there can be no assurance that the management skills and systems currently in place will be adequate if eltron continues to grow 
during and  the company completed two acquisitions and a merger 
eltron s management has only limited experience with acquisitions or mergers  which involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of key employees  suppliers  and customers of the acquired companies 
management of inventory the company s market requires that its products be shipped very quickly after an order is received 
since purchased component and manufacturing lead times are typically much longer than the short order fulfillment time for the company s products  the company is required to keep adequate inventories of both components and finished goods  and must accurately forecast demand for its many products 
inaccurate forecasts of customer demand  restricted availability of purchased components  supplier quality control problems  production equipment problems  cargo carrier strikes or damage to products during manufacture could result in a buildup of excess components or finished goods on the one hand and an inability to deliver product on a timely basis on the other hand  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
competition competition in the bar code printer market is intense and is expected by the company to increase 
the company competes with a number of companies  many of which have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
the company believes its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside its control  including product pricing  quality and performance  success in developing new products  adequate manufacturing capacity and supply of components and materials  efficiency of manufacturing operations  effectiveness of sales and marketing resources and strategies  strategic relationships with other suppliers  timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors  general market and economic conditions  and government actions worldwide 
risks associated with international operations the company s sales outside of the united states totaled approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its revenues 
international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  fluctuating exchange rates  increased difficulty of inventory management  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks associated with localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  and burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to increase or maintain its international sales or on its financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
a substantial portion of the value of the components used in the manufacture of the company s products is represented by components purchased from entities based in japan 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and japanese yen could result in an increase in the cost of these components 
the company has not entered into any currency hedging transactions to date  however  in the future  the company may seek to hedge certain transactions 
development of markets and acceptance of products  growth of bar code market the company s continued growth will depend on the company s ability to improve and market its existing products and to develop and successfully market new products 
however  the company s near term financial results will depend in part upon increasing market acceptance of  and the company s ability to expand the market share for  its products 
there can be no assurance that any new products the company may introduce will gain market acceptance 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by a high degree of competition  rapidly changing technology  frequent new product introductions and price erosion 
accordingly  the company believes its future prospects depend on its ability not only to enhance and successfully market its existing products  but also to develop and introduce new products in a timely fashion that achieve market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  design  develop  market or support such products successfully or that the company will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or product announcements by competitors 
delays in new product introductions or product enhancements  or the introduction of unsuccessful products  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company s current products are primarily used in the bar code market  which began in the s and since then has experienced substantial growth  particularly since to the extent the bar code market does not continue to grow or experiences a significant economic downturn  the company s ability to generate revenues could be materially adversely affected 
moreover  even if the size of the bar code market does increase  there can be no assurance that the demand for the company s products will also increase 
reliance on certain suppliers the company purchases numerous parts  supplies and other components from various suppliers  which the company assembles into its products 
although there are at least two sources for many of such parts  supplies and components  the company currently relies on a single source of supply  mitsubishi electronics  for the main microprocessor used to control its printers  and is heavily dependent on rohm co  ltd 
and kyocera industrial ceramics cp  its primary supply sources for print heads  and nmb technologies  inc  its primary supply source for motors 
as such  the company is vulnerable to limits in supply and pricing and product changes by these suppliers 
although management believes that such changes could be accommodated by the company  they may necessitate changes in the company s product design or manufacturing methods  and the company could experience temporary delays or interruptions in supply while such changes are incorporated 
further  because the order time for microprocessors  print heads and motors averages four months  the company could also experience delays or interruptions in supply in the event the company is required to find a new supplier for any of these components 
any future disruptions in supply of suitable parts and components from the company s principal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
no back up tooling exists for many of the company s molded plastic components 
should a mold break or become unusable  repair or replacement could take several months 
the company does not always maintain sufficient inventory to allow it to fill customer orders without interruption during the time that would be required to obtain an adequate supply of molded plastic products 
accordingly  an extended interruption in the supply of any such components could adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
