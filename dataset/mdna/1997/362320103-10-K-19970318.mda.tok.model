for that period the average annual return for the regional bell operating companies was 
gte s commitment to shareholder value is supported by clear investment criteria investments must be in the company s core business  telecommunications  and they must be expected to earn more than their cost of capital over time 
gte s commitment to shareholder value is also supported by a policy of maintaining a dividend payout ratio that is competitive with peer companies 
consistent with this policy  gte maintained its dividend at per share in  resulting in a dividend payout ratio of 
consolidated operations gte had another outstanding year in domestically  gte realized record growth in access lines and network usage  strong growth in cellular customers and double digit productivity improvements

in the us  new price reductions in response to regulatory actions  reduced revenues by approximately million in  bringing cumulative price reductions over the past three years to approximately million 
since  cumulative price reductions have totaled approximately billion 
outside the us  local rate rebalancing programs in canada and the dominican republic more than offset toll revenue losses resulting from competitive pressures 
the rollout of new and expanded services also drove the increase in revenues 
these services  which include gte long distance  centranet r  data and custom calling features  such as caller id and smartcall r  increased to  million in this compares to million of revenues recorded in these new services are expected to continue to contribute a larger percentage of gte s total revenue stream in future years as a result of strong business and consumer demand 
operating income for reached a record billion  up from the billion reported in the increase was due to higher revenues and ongoing cost reductions from process re engineering activities  partially offset by higher costs associated with the expansion of core wireline and wireless businesses as well as investment in new revenue initiatives 
net interest expense declined slightly from levels as the favorable effects of lower interest rates were partially offset by slightly higher debt balances 
other expense totaled million in compared with million in  primarily reflecting the higher gains recorded in in connection with nonstrategic property sales  partially offset by the higher income from unconsolidated subsidiaries

local service revenues local service revenues are based on fees charged to customers for providing local telephone exchange service within designated franchise areas 
local service revenues increased to billion in this growth was attributable to placing a record million domestic access lines in service during  an growth rate  resulting primarily from a million  or  increase in business lines and  or  increase in residential second lines 
the growth in second lines is attributable to strong consumer demand for access to the internet and online computer services and fax machines 
additionally   international access lines were added in excluding approximately  related to cantv  the venezuelan telephone company in which gte has a minority stake 
network access service revenues interstate and intrastate network access service revenues are based on fees charged to interexchange carriers that use gte s us local exchange network in providing long distance services to their customers 
network access service revenues of billion grew from billion in the impact of the growth in minutes of use of gte s domestic local exchange network for long distance calling was partially offset by competitive and regulatory mandated rate reductions 
toll service revenues toll service revenues are based on fees charged for service beyond a customer s local calling area but within the local access transport area lata and also include revenues of gte long distance service introduced in toll service revenues decreased to billion from the level 
this slight decline was primarily attributable to price reductions to meet competition and regulatory mandated rate reductions 
partially offsetting these reductions were revenues related to gte long distance service 
cellular service revenues cellular service revenues grew to billion from billion in the growth in revenues was primarily attributable to the growth in customers both in the us and internationally 
total us customers served at the end of reached  an increase of over cellular market penetration increased to in compared with in the revenue growth was tempered by a decline in revenues per customer per month in the us  reflecting continued growth of casual and security users in the customer base 
during the year  revenues per customer in the us averaged per month compared with in  a decline 
directory services revenues directory services revenues result primarily from the sale of yellow pages advertising and also include fees charged to print  publish and distribute telephone directories 
gte annually publishes or provides sales and other directory related services for approximately  different directories in states and foreign countries 
directory services revenues increased to billion in  reflecting growth in existing markets  acquisitions and market expansions in the us  including superpages r interactive service as well as the timing of international publications 
other services and sales other services and sales include revenues from gte government systems  which provides integrated telecommunication systems and customized solutions and equipment to us government defense and civilian agencies as well as commercial users both domestically and internationally  gte airfone  which provides aircraft based telecommunication services for passengers  and telephone and cellular equipment sales and services 
other services and sales revenues increased to billion in  reflecting a growth rate of due to higher non network related equipment and systems sales 
during  gte government systems received orders valued at billion  a slight increase over cost of services and sales cost of services and sales increased to billion in compared with billion in  primarily reflecting the growth in sales of telecommunication systems and equipment as well as directory publication costs  partially offset by lower costs related to the impacts of the process re engineering program at domestic telephone operations 
this program  which was substantially completed in  has redesigned and streamlined processes to improve customer responsiveness and product quality  while shortening the time necessary to introduce new products and services  thus further reducing costs 
in addition  the consolidation of work centers and the rollout of technologically advanced systems has reduced labor intensive processes 
for example  express dial tone  which enables a customer to start local service without waiting for a service call  was implemented in most major service territories  and gte s one touch process  which allows a wide range of customer needs to be satisfied by contacting just one service representative  is now available in most of gte s domestic telephone service areas 
us access lines per employee  a key indicator of productivity  totaled at year end  a increase over and a increase since the end of by the end of  domestic telephone operations had reduced its us workforce to approximately  employees 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased in to billion from billion in the growth in these operating costs is primarily related to higher selling and advertising costs  which grew from levels  associated with the strong customer growth  support of new initiatives and heightened brand awareness  within gte s core wireline and wireless operations 
partially offsetting these increases were ongoing cost containment and reduction programs  which have been implemented across all business units 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased to billion in compared with billion in the increase reflects the expansion of the wireline network to meet demand for additional lines  enhanced calling features and switched data services  and the continued deployment of enabling technologies for broadband services 
the wireless network was also expanded to provide significantly higher capacity and to improve service quality 
other income and expense in  gte reported other expense of million compared with other expense of million in other income and expense is comprised primarily of minority interests  earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries  which include international ventures and cellular partnerships  and gains on sales of nonstrategic properties 
minority interests increased million in to million as a result of higher earnings in the canadian operations 
the increase in minority interest was more than offset by higher income from unconsolidated subsidiaries 
equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries improved considerably in  primarily driven by higher earnings from cantv  the venezuelan telephone company that is operated by gte 
gte s results from cantv were favorably affected by operating improvements stemming from timely rate increases  productivity gains resulting from employee reductions and other cost controls and a stabilizing economy 
in contrast during  cantv operated within a weak economy with currency controls and limited access to international banking and capital markets 
as a result of these conditions  cantv made a relatively small contribution to gte s earnings 
due to the high level of inflation in venezuela  cantv s financial performance is highly dependent on its ability to increase tariffs 
in and  cantv successfully obtained tariff increases  in accordance with the concession agreement with the venezuelan government 
gte continues to view its interest in cantv as an excellent long term investment 
in the fourth quarter of  gte purchased million of shares  increasing its ownership in cantv from to 
partially offsetting gte s earnings from cantv were losses in cti  the cellular telephone company in argentina  related to costs associated with improvements to the network and distribution channels as well as customer growth 
also included in other income and expense are gains on the sales of nonstrategic domestic telephone properties of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
regulatory and competitive trends significant regulatory and legislative developments occurred during  including the passage of the telecommunications act of act 
the act is intended to promote competition in all sectors of the telecommunications marketplace  while preserving and advancing universal telephone service 
as a result of the act  gte may be faced with increased competition from numerous sources  including local exchange carriers  competitive access providers  wireless carriers cellular and pcs  cable providers terrestrial  wireless and satellite  long distance companies  media and computer companies 
these companies collectively have the ability to offer a broad array of voice  video and data services to business and residential customers 
following passage of the act  the fcc has undertaken to issue rules governing three areas interconnection  universal service and access charge reform 
in august  the fcc adopted its rules governing interconnection 
these rules generally require local exchange carriers to make their services available to competitors at a wholesale discount and to make their network elements available to competitors at below cost prices 
gte petitioned for judicial review of these rules on the grounds that they were inconsistent with the act 
in october  the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit granted gte s request for a stay of the pricing provisions of the fcc s rules pending the court s resolution of the merits of gte s petition 
oral arguments on the merits were held in january  and the court s ruling is expected in the spring of in november  the federal state joint board released its recommended universal service plan  and in december  the fcc issued its access reform proposals 
both proposals incorporate a pricing methodology similar to the one that gte is appealing in the interconnection case 
a final order in the universal service proceeding must be adopted by early may  and a decision on the access reform proceeding is expected shortly thereafter 
the increasingly competitive environment will necessitate continued efforts by gte to improve productivity factors as well as cost controls and utilize strategic price reductions to maintain market position 
however  gte will also take advantage of the greater freedom it obtained under the act to pursue competitive market opportunities  generating new sources of revenue 
gte has exercised its right under the act to challenge state puc arbitration orders that govern agreements between gte and its competitors 
in december  gte filed lawsuits in federal district court in five states pennsylvania  virginia  illinois  washington and missouri on the grounds that the state puc arbitration orders violated the act by among other things forcing gte to provide its services and network elements at unlawfully low prices 
in  gte filed similar lawsuits in federal district court in a number of other states 
approximately of gte s domestic access lines are in nine states that have adopted incentive regulation plans for intrastate service  including california  florida and texas  the states where gte s largest operations are located 
approximately of the regulated revenues for gte s domestic telephone operations are under some form of alternative regulation  including of the interstate revenues 
gte s annual interstate access filing was approved by the fcc in june overall  the filing resulted in price reductions of million  effective july  internationally  the pace of regulatory and competitive change has also accelerated 
in canada  a decision was made during allowing gte s majority owned subsidiaries entry to the cable tv and interactive multimedia markets 
in addition  a decision is also expected early in regarding the implementation of price cap regulations that will govern the price  rather than the profits  of gte s canadian subsidiaries products and services 
in the dominican republic  competitive pressures for international and local toll traffic continue to impact revenues and operating margins 
however  government approved local rate increases as well as the implementation of productivity improvement programs are expected to offset the impact of competition 
gte continues to support greater competition in telecommunications  provided that  overall  the actions to eliminate existing legal and regulatory barriers benefit consumers by allowing an opportunity for all service providers to participate in a competitive marketplace under comparable conditions 
gte initiatives in  gte continued to position itself to respond aggressively to competitive developments and benefit from new opportunities 
in march  gte began offering long distance service  through a nonexclusive agreement with worldcom  inc in july  gte began offering internet access services through an agreement with uunet 
at december   gte was providing long distance service in all states to over  customers and nationwide internet access services to over  customers 
in addition  gte had been granted three video franchises in pinellas county  florida  and three video franchises in ventura county  california 
network construction in those markets is under way and approximately  new video customers were added during  bringing gte s total video customer base to approximately  in addition  gte continues its participation in the americast r joint venture with the walt disney company  along with ameritech  bellsouth corporation  sbc communications and southern new england telephone 
this venture is designed to provide video programming and content for the telecommunications partners video offerings and work has been initiated in many areas  including the selection of technology and the creation of an advanced navigator 
during  gte substantially completed the implementation of the billion re engineering program for its domestic telephone operations 
total costs of the program included million related to improvements in customer service processes  million related to improvements in administration processes and million related to the consolidation of facilities and operations 
the plan has produced annualized cost savings of over billion 
gte is also actively pursuing expansion of its international operations to capitalize on opportunities for long term profitable growth 
in  gte established a joint venture with a leading chinese wireless telecommunications operator 
gte has invested approximately million to date  which will be used to design  build and install wireless networks  provide training and offer technical consulting 
the venture s first project is to support a wireless paging system that will eventually encompass major metropolitan areas  including beijing 
in january  the government of taiwan awarded a digital cellular license to pacific communication services co 
ltd  a consortium in which gte holds a minority interest as the only foreign stakeholder 
gte is expected to invest approximately million into this venture 
capital investment  resources and liquidity return on equity gte s return on average common equity was in compared with in  before considering the extraordinary charges in and the gains on the sales of certain nonstrategic domestic telephone properties in both years 
including the extraordinary charges and gains on sales of nonstrategic domestic telephone properties  the return on average common equity for and was and  respectively 
capitalization gte targets a capital structure and overall credit position that is appropriate for an a rated company 
this allows gte s shareholders to enjoy the benefits of prudent and reasonable financial leverage  while also protecting debtholder interests and ensuring ready access to the capital markets 
in june  moody s raised its rating on gte corporation s senior debt to a from baa and in december  standard and poor s raised its rating on gte corporation s senior debt to a from bbb 
during  gte negotiated two new credit facilities for billion  including a five year line of billion for gte corporation and a day line of billion for certain domestic telephone operations 
fifty seven banks representing countries participated in the syndicated facility  which will be used primarily to back up commercial paper borrowings which replaced multiple bilateral facilities 
total equity as a percentage of total capitalization was at the end of compared with in cash flow gte s cash flow from operations increased to billion in from billion in  reflecting improved operating results 
capital expenditures totaled billion in  approximately million more than the level of expenditures 
the total reflected expenditures used for the deployment of broadband video networks in california and florida  buildout of the new wireless pcs networks and other requirements to support new revenue growth initiatives and expanded service capabilities  partially offset by lower spending on domestic cellular networks 
gte expects capital expenditures to increase slightly in for the continued expansion of existing domestic and international networks  upgrades associated with the support of expanded services such as video and data  and compliance with the number portability requirements of the act 
during the fourth quarter of  gte increased its investment in cantv by million through purchases during the initial public offering of cantv shares by the government of venezuela and subsequent market purchases 
gte announced plans to buy as much as million of this offering 
also in  gte announced plans to repurchase up to million shares of its currently issued common stock from time to time  depending on market conditions through july the repurchase program is in addition to the million share repurchase program announced in the shares will be used to satisfy the requirements of gte s employee benefit and dividend reinvestment programs 
at the end of  a total of million shares had been repurchased under these programs 
cash used for the purchase of these shares was billion in and million in during  gte received proceeds of about million for the sales of certain pcs licenses acquired during in  gte s cash flow from operations increased to billion from billion in  reflecting improved operating results as well as lower tax payments from nonstrategic property sales and the completion of a major government contract  in capital expenditures totaled billion in  about below the level of expenditures in the declining requirements for conversion to digital switching systems offset expansion and enhancements of the cellular network as well as investments in fiber optics and other enabling technologies for broadband services 
at the end of  gte redeemed  in advance of scheduled maturity  million of its telephone operating subsidiaries high coupon debt issues and series of preferred stock totaling million 
the refinancing of the high coupon debt and preferred stock was completed in in  the funding of dividends and capital requirements for gte s businesses will be substantially sourced by cash from operations  although gte s strong financial position allows ready access to worldwide capital markets for any additional cash requirements 
forward looking statements gte has projected earnings per share growth of not less than for the foreseeable future and consolidated revenue growth in the range of to for revenues from gte s domestic telephone operations are expected to grow by to  with much of the growth driven by expanded services and new initiatives such as long distance  internet and video services 
in the area of long distance  gte expects to almost double its customer base in and increase its revenues about seven times 
operating margins for domestic telephone operations are expected to be consistent with similar margins achieved in gte has projected domestic cellular operations will grow consistent with the industry and will add as many new customers in as were added in cellular revenue per customer  however  is expected to continue a to downward trend as more residential customers and new competitors enter the market 
gte continues to project that the amount of net income contributed by its international operations in will double by the year risk factors gte s forward looking statements are based upon a series of projections and estimates regarding the economy  the telecommunications industry  the effects of federal  state and local regulations on the industry in general and within our markets  as well as key performance indicators that affect the company directly 
these projections and estimates regarding the economy and the telecommunications industry relate to the demand for and pricing of services  the effects of competition  the impact of universal service and the success of new products  services and new businesses such as long distance 
with regard to the effects of regulation  gte has assumed fair and reasonable resolutions to any pending and potential federal  state and local regulatory initiatives and proceedings  including arbitration proceedings before various state regulatory commissions 
gte has also assumed the successful outcome of the proceedings filed with the court of appeals for the eighth circuit challenging the fcc s published report and order  dated august   regarding the terms of interconnection  unbundled network elements and resale rates 
in developing its forward looking statements  gte has made certain assumptions relating to key performance indicators that have a direct bearing on gte s ability to attain these projections 
these assumptions include the continued annual growth of telephone access lines and minutes of use  new and expanded services  cellular volumes  and customer growth 
they also assume productivity improvements and the absence of disruption to gte s markets 
if future events and actual performance differ from that assumed for the risk factors noted above  gte s actual results could vary significantly from the performance projected in the forward looking statements
