item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations consolidated results operating revenues have been separated into revenues generated from the sale and transportation of natural gas by national gas and producers gas and the sale of oil and gas purchased and produced by ngo development 
other income includes the revenues of the holding company  national gas oil company and other income from all subsidiaries 
consolidated revenue of  in increased percent from consolidated revenue and consolidated revenue of  in decreased percent from consolidated revenue 
the increase in revenue over is primarily due to increased gas marketing activity and higher gas prices 
the decrease in revenue in is primarily attributed to lower gas volumes sold and declining gas prices 
purchase gas expense increased from to and decreased from to as a result of changes in gas sales activities 
interest expense has increased each year since as a result of additional borrowings to maintain working capital requirements and upgrade storage facilities for national gas  to finance the acquisition of ngo development and its capital construction programs and to finance the construction of the pipeline to the american electric power company s electric generating plant 
net income amounted to  in  an increase of  from the percent increase was because of increased income in all business segments  but primarily with the oil and gas sales segment 
in  net income was down  or seven percent  from which was attributable to all business segments 
net income per common share in was  as compared to net income per common share in of  and in of 
all per share amounts have been restated to reflect the three percent stock dividend in december financial information by business segment the following tables compare operating revenues  operating income before federal income taxes and gas throughput for the last three years

changes in the level of over and under recovery of gas costs affect residential and commercial customer operating revenues because under the gas cost recovery gcr mechanism established by the puco  such over or under recovery of purchased gas costs is reflected in the computation of future billings to customers 
amounts collected through the gcr mechanism are subject to annual review by the puco 
in  reductions in expected gas costs and refunds lowered operating revenues

annual degree days which measure the effect of weather were   and  for  and  respectively 
the thirty year average is  operating income before federal income taxes of the gas sales and transportation segment decreased  in after increasing  in the decrease in was attributed to volume and margin changes  while the increase in is primarily attributed to increased margins earned on the residential commercial and transportation customer classes 
the change in gross margin for each on system customer class of national gas during was affected by volume and price as follows volume price total industrial    residential commercial    transportation    in order to protect transportation margins  the company utilizes a hedging program whereby gas futures and gas price swap contracts are purchased to hedge against rising prices of gas which is allocated to fixed price transportation customers 
the company has partially reduced the risk it faced in a market of rising gas prices 
during the third quarter of  the company analyzed the need for base rate increases and decided to apply for rate increases with the cities and villages in national gas operating area to cover anticipated increases in operating expenses 
rate increases over a three year period were successfully negotiated with all municipalities served by national gas 
the initial rate increases were effective december  with subsequent increases effective in and industrial  transportation and off system rates are subject to competitive pressures

residential and commercial throughput increased approximately percent in after having decreased by approximately two percent in transportation throughput increased by one percent in after decreasing percent in the increase in purchased gas expense of percent in is primarily the result of increased sales volume and an increase in the cost of gas 
the decrease in purchased gas expense of percent in resulted primarily from a decrease in sales volume and decrease in the cost of gas 
the company utilizes its resources to take advantage of the seasonal nature of natural gas pricing 
spot market purchasing is accomplished when possible  and the company s storage facilities are utilized not only to satisfy peak demand  but to facilitate the seasonal nature of spot market purchasing 
oil and gas sales operating revenues from the oil and gas sales segment in increased to  due to the increased gas marketing activity and higher gas prices 
gas marketing contributed approximately percent of the total revenue for this business segment in ngo development s gas marketing activity generally consists of selling gas to off system customers in a highly competitive environment 
unit margins on these off system sales are relatively low when compared to unit margins on sales to on system customers in the gas sales and transportation segment 
operating income before federal income taxes from the oil and gas sales segment in amounted to  an increase of  from income in of  income in represented a  decrease from income in of  the increase in income in is primarily the result of increased gas marketing activity  increased oil production  and higher gas prices  while the decrease in is the result of decreased gas and oil production and gas marketing activity 
gas marketing activity contributed approximately percent of the total income for this business segment in the company is subject to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of

at december   future cash flows undiscounted and without interest of million exceeded the carrying value by million 
general the company s depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses have increased over the three year period primarily as a result of the increased level of capital invested 
the provision for depreciation of utility property  plant and equipment  excluding transportation and construction equipment  is based on a composite rate of percent 
depletion expense for the oil and gas sales segment remained relatively flat over the three year period 
real estate and personal property taxes for the gas sales and transportation segment increased in because of increases in utility property and in property tax rates 
gross receipts tax applicable to public utilities is based on revenues  and accordingly  such taxes increased in overall  taxes other than income taxes increased  and  in and  respectively

effects of inflation the million bank loan entered into in october and the million revolver entered into in february  accrue interest at a fluctuating rate equal to either the bank s prime rate or to the london interbank offered rate libor 
because of the fluctuating rate  the company is exposed to increases in interest expense should rates increase due to inflation 
this same interest expense risk is present with the  mortgage note which accrues interest at the prime rate 
although the rate of inflation has been relatively low over the past few years  and thus has benefited both the company and its customers  the company s operations remain sensitive to increases in the rate of inflation because of the capital intensive and regulated nature of its major operating segment
