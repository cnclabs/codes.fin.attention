item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis and the related financial data present a review of the consolidated operating results and financial condition of bankunited financial corporation also referred to as the company or bankunited for the fiscal years ended september   and this discussion and analysis are presented to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the financial condition  results of operations and future prospects of bankunited  and are intended to supplement  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
bankunited s income is derived primarily from its loans and other investments 
funding for such loans and investments is derived principally from deposits  loan repayments  and borrowings 
consequently  bankunited s net income depends  to a large extent  on the interest rate spread between the average yield earned on loans and investments and the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also dependent on the dollar volume and asset quality of bankunited s loans and investments 
in addition to the foregoing  results of bankunited s operations  like those of other financial institution holding companies  are affected by bankunited s asset and liability management policies  as well as factors beyond bankunited s control  such as general economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
lending activities are affected by the demand for mortgage financing and other types of loans  which is in turn affected by the interest rates at which such financings may be offered and other factors affecting the supply of housing and the availability of funds 
deposit flows and costs of funds are influenced by yields available on competing investments and by general market rates of interest 
acquisitions the company has had an active acquisition program during the last two years and expects to continue this program in the foreseeable future 
in september  the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire consumers bancorp  inc for approximately million in a combination of cash and stock 
consumers bancorp  inc is a thrift holding company for consumers savings bank which had assets of million and deposits of million at september  on november   bankunited completed its acquisition of suncoast 
suncoast had total assets of million  net loans of million  deposits of million and shareholders equity of million as of september  the cost of the acquisition to bankunited was million  representing the fair value of consideration given to suncoast shareholders as well as option and warrant holders 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this acquisition 
in march  bankunited also acquired for cash consideration of million  the bank of florida  a one branch state commercial bank which had assets of million and deposits of million on the date of acquisition 
discussion of financial condition changes for the years ended september    and total assets increased billion  or to billion at september  from million at september   as compared to million at september  loans 
the company s net loans receivable increased by billion  or to billion at september  from million at september  the increase was primarily the result of the million of residential loans purchased in fiscal  million of loans acquired with suncoast  and million of loan originations  partially offset by principal repayments of million net of accretion of discount and amortization of premium 
in fiscal  the company s net loans receivable increased by million  or  from million at september  the increase was primarily the result of million of purchased residential loans  a million purchase of a commercial real estate loan package  and million of loan originations  partially offset by principal repayments of million 
the commercial real estate loan package was comprised of loans in south florida with principal balances ranging from  to million 
of the new loans originated or purchased during fiscal totaling billion  million or represented adjustable rate residential loans arms 
of bankunited s total net loans receivable of billion at september   billion or were arms 
of this amount bankunited had million in arms tied to the th district federal home loan bank cost of funds index cofi 
cofi is a lagging index in that it does not change as quickly as market rates 
see business lending activities residential mortgage loan purchases and originations 
loans available for sale as of september   were million as compared to no such loans available for sale as of september  and  as of september  beginning in the company s fiscal fourth quarter  management began a program to sell approximately to of the company s internally generated residential loans 
in the fourth quarter  a package of residential loans totaling million was sold for a gain of  in addition  as part of starting this program  the company reclassified million of its internally generated portfolio of residential loans as available for sale in the fourth quarter 
it is currently the company s intention that future loans classified as available for sale will be identified and so classified at time of origination 
the company also reclassified all commercial loans acquired with suncoast that were secured by properties outside the state of florida totaling million as available for sale 
credit quality 
at september   non performing assets totaled million as compared to million and million at september  and  respectively 
expressed as a percentage of total assets  non performing assets declined to 
as of september  as compared to 
as of september  and as of september  the increase in non performing assets in both and is due primarily to the increase in loans 
prior to  bankunited did not experience significant loan losses 
however  beginning in late  bankunited began to charge off loans  particularly in southern california where real estate values declined 
real estate values in southern california had declined because of i a slowing in the economy due to plant closings and layoffs in certain industries  ii natural disasters in the area  and iii an over valuation of the real estate market  in general  prior to the decline 
while real estate values in southern california stabilized during  bankunited believes that real estate values there have declined sufficiently since for there to be a continuing risk that borrowers faced with home mortgage payments based on values would default on their home mortgages 
from late through september  bankunited recorded a total of million in charge offs for residential loans secured by property in southern california 
of these southern california charge offs  million were for loans purchased from a single seller 
bankunited instituted legal action against the seller for breach of warranty to recover bankunited s losses 
in october  this legal action was settled  which resulted in a recovery of million 
taking this recovery into account  bankunited recorded net charge offs of million for the period from late through september   of which million or were for residential loans secured by real properties in southern california 
beginning in fiscal  bankunited began to reduce the percentage of new loans acquired which were secured by property located in california and ceased acquiring all but de minimis amounts of such loans in april as of september  bankunited had million of residential loans in california which constituted of its assets 
this compares to million  or of its assets as of september   and million or as of september  effective in fiscal  after taking into account the improved economic conditions in southern california  management discontinued this policy 
the allowance for loan losses was million  million  and million at september    and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased to 
at fiscal year end  as compared to 
at fiscal year end  and 
at fiscal year end the decrease in the allowance as a percentage of total loans reflects the company s recent charge off history which shows net charge offs recoveries as a percentage of average loans of  
and 
for  and  respectively 
the increase in non performing assets to million as of september  from million as of september  was due to increases in non performing loans of million which  as stated above  relates to the increase in total loans 
real estate owned declined from million as of september  to  as of september   to  as of september  at september   million  or  of bankunited s non performing loans were secured by southern california properties as compared to million  or  as of september   and million  or as of september  effective october   bankunited adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan as amended by sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures sfas no 

there was no impact on the consolidated statement of operations upon implementation due to the composition of bankunited s loan portfolio primarily residential or collateral dependent loans and bankunited s policy for establishing the allowance for loan losses 
the only impact to the consolidated statement of financial condition and to non performing assets was to reclassify three loans totaling  previously classified as in substance foreclosures in real estate owned to non accrual loans 
these loans were reclassified because bankunited did not have possession of the collateral which  under sfas no 
 is required for a loan to be classified as real estate owned 
sfas no 
does not apply to large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
loans collectively reviewed by bankunited for impairment include all residential and consumer loans that are past due not more than days 
all other loans are reviewed based on specific criteria such as delinquency or other factors that may come to the attention of management 
bankunited s impaired loans within the scope of sfas no 
include all non performing loans 
bankunited s process for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loans losses has three basic elements first is the identification of impaired loans  second is the establishment of an appropriate loan loss allowance once individual specific impaired loans are identified  and third is a methodology for establishing loan losses based on the inherent risk in the remainder of the loan portfolio  past loan loss experience  specific loans which could have loss potential  geographic and industry concentration  delinquency trends  economic conditions  the views of its regulators  and other relevant factors 
the identification of impaired loans is achieved mainly through individual reviews of all loans or more days past due 
loss allowances are established for specifically identified impaired loans based on the fair value of the underlying collateral in accordance with sfas no 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for loan losses 
adjustments to impairment losses resulting from changes in the fair value of an impaired loan s collateral are included in the provision for loan losses 
upon disposition of an impaired loan any related valuation allowance is removed from the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is adjusted by additions charged to operations as a provision for loan losses and by loan recoveries  with actual losses charged as reductions to the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate given the strength of bankunited s collateral position and the attention given to loan review and classifications 
there can be no assurance that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required in future periods

in addition to the above  management has concerns as to the borrower s ability to comply with present repayment terms on  and  of accruing loans as of september  and  respectively 
management estimates the loss  if any  on these loans will not be significant 
based on balances prior to deductions for allowance for loan losses 
federal home loan bank fhlb overnight deposits 
fhlb overnight deposits increased to million at september  from million at september  and million at september  this increase is due to increased liquidity requirements caused by the growth in the balance sheet 
tax certificates 
bankunited s investment in tax certificates increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  and million at september  the increase was primarily the result of million in certificate purchases during fiscal which exceeded million in certificate redemptions and repayments 
investments 
investments held to maturity increased million to million as of september  as compared with  as of september  and million as of september  investments available for sale increased million to million as of september  as compared to million as of september  and none as of september  the increase in both of these categories is primarily due to the investment in agency securities for liquidity purposes 
mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities  held to maturity were million  million and million at september   and respectively 
in fiscal the company s portfolio decreased million  or  primarily as a result of bankunited s reclassifying million of held to maturity mortgage backed securities to available for sale in accordance with a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities issued by the financial accounting standards board which permitted a one time reclassification 
the reclassified securities had a market value of  in excess of their book value at the time of the transfer 
bankunited s available for sale mortgage backed securities portfolio increased million to million as of september  from million as of september   and million as of september  in fiscal  the increase was due to million of securities acquired with suncoast and purchases of million  partially offset by maturities and pay downs of million 
in fiscal  million of the increase was due to the reclassification from held to maturity discussed above  million of the increase was due to securities acquired with the bank of florida  and the remainder of the increase was due to purchases made during the fiscal year 
other interest earning assets 
other interest earning assets increased to million at september  from million as of september  and million as of september  this category primarily represents stock in the fhlb which the company is required to purchase as fhlb advances increase 
other assets 
from september  to september   office properties and equipment  net  mortgage servicing rights  goodwill and prepaid and other assets increased by million  million  million and million  respectively

bankunited intends to open as many as eight branches in the fiscal year 
fhlb advances 
fhlb advances were million at september   up million from the million at september  this increase was the result of fhlb advances being used to fund the purchase of residential loans as well as million of advances assumed by bankunited in connection with the acquisition of suncoast

subordinated notes 
on august   bankunited called all outstanding subordinated notes totaling  stockholders equity 
bankunited s total stockholders equity was million at september   an increase of million  or from million at september  this was due primarily to the issuance of  shares of class a common stock and  shares of noncumulative convertible preferred stock  series  in connection with the suncoast acquisition 
the estimated value of the stock issued to acquire suncoast was million 
in february  the holder of bankunited s series c and series c ii classes of preferred stock exercised the right to convert both classes to class a common stock at exchange ratios of shares of class a common stock for each share of series c preferred stock and shares of class a common stock for each share of series c ii preferred stock 
bankunited had previously exercised its right to call both classes of preferred stock

liquidity and capital resources 
bankunited s most significant sources of funds are deposits  fhlb advances  amortization and pre payment of mortgage loans and securities  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and earnings and funds provided from operations 
while fhlb advances  scheduled mortgage loan repayments and securities repayments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
bankunited manages the pricing of its deposits to maintain a desired balance 
in addition  bankunited invests excess funds in federal funds and other short term interest earning assets which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
the bank is required under applicable federal regulations to maintain specified levels of liquid investments in cash  united states government securities and other qualifying investments

the remaining increase in average interest earning assets is due primarily to loan purchases 
the average yield on interest earning assets increased basis points to for the year ended september   from for the year ended september  the increase in average yield was attributable to an increase in the yield on loans receivable relating primarily to commercial real estate and construction loans acquired with suncoast

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the business of the company and the composition of its balance sheet consists of investments in interest earning assets primarily loans  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities which are primarily funded by interest bearing liabilities deposits and borrowings 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market interest rates resulting in market risk 
other than loans which are originated and held for sale  all of the financial instruments of the company are for other than trading purposes 
interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals and interest rate indices of the interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments are different  creating a risk that changes in the level of market interest rates will result in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  the company s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through the company s strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which generate favorable earnings  while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
since the company s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  the company s ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer preferences in the market areas in which the company operates 
borrowings  which include fhlb advances  short term borrowings  and long term borrowings  are generally structured with specific terms which in management s judgement  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  mitigate the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the rates  terms and interest rate indices of the company s interest earning assets result primarily from the company s strategy of investing in loans and securities a substantial portion of which have adjustable rate terms which permit the company to limit its exposure to interest rate risk  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread from the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities see business factors affecting earnings asset and liability management for a further discussion of rate sensitive assets  rate sensitive liabilities and net interest spread 
significant assumptions utilized in managing interest rate risk managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk involves significant assumptions about the exercise of imbedded options and the relationship of various interest rate indices of certain financial instruments 
imbedded options 
a substantial portion of the company s loans and mortgage backed securities are residential mortgage loans containing significant imbedded options which permit the borrower to prepay the principal balance of the loan prior to maturity prepayments without penalty 
a loan s propensity for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  including  the current interest rate and interest rate index if any on the loan  the financial ability of the borrower to refinance  the economic benefit to be obtained from refinancing  availability of refinancing at attractive terms  as well as economic and other factors in specific geographic areas which affect the sales and price levels of residential property 
in a changing interest rate environment  prepayments may increase or decrease on fixed and adjustable rate loans depending on the current relative levels and expectations of future short and long term interest rates 
since a significant portion of the company s loans are arm loans  prepayments on such loans generally increase when long term interest rates fall or are at historically low levels relative to short term interest rates making fixed rate loans more desirable 
investment securities  other than those with early call provisions  generally do not have significant imbedded options and repay pursuant to specific terms until maturity 
while savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice  a continuing relationship with customers resulting in future deposits and withdrawals is generally predictable resulting in a dependable and uninterruptible source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties  while term fhlb advances have prepayment penalties  which discourage customer withdrawal of time deposits and prepayment of fhlb advances prior to maturity 
interest rate indices 
the company s arm loans and mortgage backed securities are primarily indexed to the one year constant maturity treasury index or cofi see business lending activities 
when such loans and mortgage backed securities are funded by interest bearing liabilities which are determined by other indices  primarily deposits and fhlb advances  a changing interest rate environment may result in different levels of change in the different indices leading to disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  the company s financial instruments 
each index is unique and is influenced by different external factors  therefore  the historical relationships in various indices may not necessarily be indicative of the actual change which may result in a changing interest rate environment 
interest rate risk measurement in addition to periodic gap reports see business factors affecting earnings asset and liability management comparing the sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in interest rates  management also utilizes a quarterly report model prepared for the bank by the ots based on information provided by the bank which measures the bank s exposure to interest rate risk 
the model calculates the present value of assets  liabilities  off balance sheet financial instruments  and equity at current interest rates  and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates at one percent intervals 
the present value of each major category of financial instrument is calculated by the model using estimated cash flows based on weighted average contractual rates and terms at discount rates representing the estimated current market interest rate for similar financial instruments 
the resulting present value of longer term fixed rate financial instruments are more sensitive to change in a higher or lower market interest rate scenario  while adjustable rate financial instruments largely reflect only a change in present value representing the difference between the contractual and discounted rates until the next interest rate repricing date 
the following table reflects the estimated present value of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments as calculated by the ots for the bank as of september   consolidated with the estimated present values of other financial instruments of the company  at current interest rates and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates of one and two percent

the discount rates utilized for loans and mortgage backed securities are based on estimated market interest rate levels for similar loans and securities nationwide  with prepayment levels generally assumed based on global statistics 
the unique characteristics of the company s loans and mortgage backed securities may not necessarily parallel those assumed in the model  and therefore  would likely result in different discount rates  prepayment experiences  and present values 
the discount rates utilized for deposits and borrowings are based upon available alternative types and sources of funds which are not necessarily indicative of the present value of deposits and fhlb advances since such deposits and advances are unique to  and have certain price and customer relationship advantages for  depository institutions 
the present values are determined based on the discounted cash flows over the remaining estimated lives of the financial instruments and assumes that the resulting cash flows are reinvested in financial instruments with virtually identical terms 
the total measurement of the company s exposure to interest rate risk as presented in the above table may not be representative of the actual values which might result from a higher or lower interest rate environment 
a higher or lower interest rate environment will most likely result in different investment and borrowing strategies by the company designed to further mitigate the effect on the value of  and the net earnings generated from  the company s net assets from any change in interest rates 
net portfolio value 
the ots adopted a final rule in august of incorporating an interest rate risk irr component into the risk based capital rules see regulation 
the irr component is a dollar amount that is deducted from total capital for the purpose of calculating an institution s risk based capital requirement and is measured in terms of the sensitivity of its net portfolio value npv to changes in interest rates 
an institution s npv is calculated as the net discounted cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
an institution s irr component is measured as the change in the ratio of npv to the net present value of total assets as a result of a hypothetical basis point change in market interest rates 
a resulting decline in this ratio of more than of the estimated present value of an institution s total assets prior to the hypothetical basis point change will require the institution to deduct from its regulatory capital of that excess decline 
implementation of the rule has been postponed indefinitely 
the following table presents the bank s ratio of npv to the present value of total assets as of september   as calculated by the ots  based on information provided to the ots by the company 
change in interest rates ratio of npv in basis points present value of to the present value of rate shock npv total assets total assets change dollars in thousands static   certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of a significant interest rate increase 
in addition  the previous table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities are subject to competitive and other pressures beyond the company s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes
