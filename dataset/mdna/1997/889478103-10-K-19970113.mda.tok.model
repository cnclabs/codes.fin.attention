item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement items related to the company s operations as percentages of total revenues year ended october revenues costs and expenses land and housing construction selling  general and administrative interest total costs and expenses operating income fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for fiscal of million exceeded those of fiscal by million or 
this increase in revenues was due to an increase in both the number of homes and average price per home delivered 
the increase in the number of homes delivered was due to the higher backlog of homes at october  as compared to october  and to the greater number of homes sold during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in the number of homes sold was the result of the higher number of selling communities that the company had in over and an increase in the average number of homes sold per community 
the increase in the average delivered price per home was due principally to a change in product mix to larger homes  a shift to more expensive locations  an increase in the value of options that the homebuyers selected and increases in selling prices in a number of the company s communities 
the increase in the average delivered price was partially offset by an increase in sales incentives provided to the homebuyers 
land and construction costs as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was due principally to increased material and overhead costs  increased costs of sales incentives and the additional start up costs  generally higher construction costs and the inefficiencies of production associated with the company s expansion into california  arizona  texas  north carolina and florida 
the increased overhead costs were due principally to the severe winter weather conditions that the company encountered in many of its markets in fiscal the cost increases were partially offset by the lower amount of inventory writedowns in million as compared to million 
selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to million or of revenues in fiscal as compared to million or of revenues in fiscal the increased spending was attributable to the greater number of communities that the company was operating in as compared to as well as the additional costs associated with the company s geographic expansion 
interest expense is determined on a specific lot by lot basis and will vary depending on many factors including the period of time that the land under the home was owned  the length of time that the house was under construction  and the interest rates and amount of debt carried by the company in proportion to the amount of inventory during those periods 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for fiscal of million exceeded those of by million or 
this increase was primarily the result of the greater number of homes delivered in which was principally due to the higher backlog at the beginning of fiscal as compared to the backlog at the beginning of fiscal  the greater number of contracts that were signed in compared to and to a greater number of communities delivering homes in as compared to in addition  the average price per home increased due to a change in product mix to larger homes  a shift in location of homes closed to more expensive locations and increases in selling prices 
as of october   the backlog of homes under contract amounted to million  homes  an increase over the backlog as of october  in fiscal  the company signed new contracts of million  homes  as compared to million  homes in fiscal the increase in new contracts in over was primarily due to the increase in the number of communities in which the company was offering homes for sale  a shift in location of the communities to more expensive areas  an increase in the size of the homes that our customers purchased and increases in selling prices 
the increase was partially offset by a decline in the number of homes sold per community 
land and housing construction costs amounted to million of revenues in as compared to million of revenues in as a percentage of revenues  land and land development costs  job overhead costs and write offs of inventory and previously capitalized costs that the company no longer considered realizable  were lower in than in the percentage decrease was partially offset by increased material and subcontractor costs 
the company provided for write offs of inventory and previously capitalized costs that it no longer considered realizable of million in and million in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in and amounted to million of revenues and million of revenues  respectively 
the increased spending in was the result of an increase in selling expense due to the larger number of communities in which the company was offering homes for sale in as compared to and an increase in general and administrative expenses  primarily payroll and payroll related costs  due to the overall growth and increased profitability of the company 
the decline in sg a  as a percentage of revenues  was due to revenues increasing at a faster rate than sg a spending 
interest expense is determined on a specific lot by lot basis and will vary depending on many factors including the period of time that the land was owned  the period of time that the house was under construction  and the interest rates and the amount of debt carried by the company in proportion to the amount of its inventory during those periods 
as a percentage of revenues  interest expense was lower in as compared to the decline was principally the result of an increase in the average price of homes closed in over while capitalized interest per home closed in only increased 
income taxes income taxes for fiscal  and were provided at effective rates of  and  respectively 
capital resources and liquidity funding for the company s residential development activities is principally provided by cash flows from operations  public debt and equity markets  and unsecured bank borrowings 
cash flow from operations  before inventory additions  improved as operating results improved and the company anticipates that the cash flow from operations will continue to improve as a result of an increase in revenues from the delivery of homes from the existing backlog as well as from new sales agreements 
the company has used the cash flow from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facility to acquire additional land for new communities  to fund additional expenditures for land development and construction costs needed to meet the requirements of the increased backlog  the continuing expansion of the number of communities in which the company is offering homes for sale and to reduce debt 
the company expects that inventories will continue to increase and is currently negotiating and searching for additional opportunities to obtain control of land for future communities 
the company has a million unsecured revolving credit facility with fifteen banks which extends through june the facility reduces by in june unless extended as provided for in the agreement 
as of october   the company had million of loans and approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
in addition  the company has a  loan commitment from two banks under which the company will borrow the funds in march for a period of five years at a fixed interest rate of 
in november  the company issued  of senior subordinated notes to the public 
the notes mature in november the net proceeds are to be used for general corporate purposes 
the company believes that it will be able to fund its activities through a combination of existing cash resources  operating cash flow and existing sources of credit 
inflation the long term impact of inflation on the company is manifested in increased land  land development  construction and overhead costs  as well as in increased sales prices 
for several years prior to fiscal  the company was able to raise sales prices by amounts at least equal to its cost increases 
from fiscal through february   however  sales prices either declined slightly or remained steady  and since then have risen only modestly 
the company generally contracts for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin 
accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes may affect the company s profits 
since the sales prices of homes are fixed at the time of sale and the company generally sells its homes prior to commencement of construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
the company generally attempts to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
housing demand  in general  is adversely affected by increases in interest costs  as well as in housing costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect the company s interest costs 
if the company is unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  which had generally been the condition during prior years  or if mortgage interest rates increased significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance a home purchase  the company s revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford a new home
