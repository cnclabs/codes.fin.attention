item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors affecting future operating results this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the company s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
certain factors that might cause such a difference include the following fluctuations in the volume of services delivered by the company s affiliated physicians  changes in the reimbursement rates for those services  uncertainty about the ability to collect the appropriate fees for those services  fluctuations in the cost and utilization rates of referral services used by patients that are subject to shared risk capitation arrangements  the loss of significant hospital or third party payor relationships  and changes in the number of patients using the company s physician services 
general the company is a physician practice management company which provides specialist physician services at hospitals and ambulatory surgical facilities in the areas of anesthesia  neonatology  pediatrics and emergency services and owns and operates  or manages  office based primary care  obstetrical and rheumatology practices 
the company derives substantially all of its revenue from the medical services provided by the physicians who are employed by the company or whose practices are managed by the company 
the company generates revenue from its specialist physician services by directly billing third party payors or patients on a fee for service or discounted fee for service basis 
in addition  several hospitals at which the company provides specialist physician services pay subsidies to the company to supplement revenue from billings to third party payors 
the company generates revenue from its office based physician services pursuant to various payment arrangements  including shared risk capitation arrangements  fee for service or discounted fee for service arrangements  and other capitation arrangements 
prior to september  the company generated substantially all of its revenue from specialist physician services delivered at hospitals and ambulatory surgical facilities 
from september to october  the predecessor and the company completed twelve acquisitions of office based primary care  obstetrical and rheumatology practices for an aggregate purchase price of million  as described below 
these twelve acquisitions accounted for substantially all of the company s office based revenue during the three years ended december  in march  the company completed the acquisition of a physician hospital based neonatology and pediatric practice for million in cash and approximately  shares of the company s common stock 
all of these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases  and accordingly  the company s financial statements include the operations of each of the acquired practices beginning on each respective date of acquisition 
during the year ended december   of the company s net revenue was derived from specialist physician services delivered at hospitals and ambulatory surgical facilities  and the remaining was derived from office based physician practices 
on november   the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of sheridan healthcorp  inc the predecessor for approximately million the acquisition 
as a result of this transaction  the company incurred significant interest expense in  which was related to the debt incurred to finance the transaction  and has incurred significant goodwill amortization expense since november  prior to the acquisition  physician stockholders of the predecessor received compensation payments in excess of the market compensation rate for the physician services provided to the predecessor by those stockholders 
such payments ceased upon consummation of the acquisition 
the period to period comparisons set forth below include a comparison of the results of the company to the combined results of the predecessor for the period from january  to november   and the company for the period from november  to december  the company believes that this full year to full year comparison is more meaningful than a partial year comparison would be 
on september   the predecessor acquired a four facility primary care practice for approximately million in cash and deferred payments 
from december  to march   the company completed five acquisitions of primary care and obstetrical practices for an aggregate of approximately million in cash and deferred payments 
on june   the company acquired a three facility primary care practice for million in cash 
in a transaction related to the june acquisition  one of the principal physicians operating the acquired practice assigned a panel services agreement with a health maintenance organization to the company for approximately million in cash and deferred payments and approximately  shares of common stock of the company 
in another transaction related to the june acquisition  the company agreed to make a deferred payment of  to a physician employed by the acquired practice  which was paid during the fourth quarter of this payment was treated as a bonus for accounting purposes  and accordingly  was charged to expense in its entirety during from january  to october   the company completed five acquisitions of primary care  obstetrical and rheumatology practices for an aggregate of approximately million in cash and deferred payments 
as discussed above under operations office based physician services  the company sold one office based practice location in december  sold a second office based location in february  and currently intends to sell several other practices 
the office based practices which have been sold  and which the company currently intends to sell  include the four facility practice acquired on september   two primary care practices acquired in february and two rheumatology practices acquired in under shared risk capitation arrangements  which accounted for approximately of the company s net revenue in  the company receives a fixed monthly amount from a managed care organization in exchange for providing  or arranging the provision of  substantially all of the health care services required by members of the managed care organization 
the company generally provides all of the primary care services required under such arrangements  and refers its patients to unaffiliated specialist physicians  hospitals  and other health care providers which deliver the remainder of the required health care services 
the company s profitability under such arrangements is dependent upon its ability to effectively manage the use of specialist physician  hospital and other health care services by its patients 
commencing in  the company made significant investments in personnel  computer equipment  computer software and other infrastructure costs in order to effectively manage all of the acquired physician practices  particularly those practices which derive a majority of their revenue from shared risk capitation arrangements 
these investments resulted in significant increases in salaries and benefits  general and administrative expenses  and capital expenditures during and  compared to prior years 
the company s office based physician practices generated net revenues of million and million in and  and incurred operating losses of million and million in and the million operating loss in includes a  bonus paid to a physician employed by a practice acquired by the company in june  as discussed above 
due to the company s decision to sell certain office based practices  as discussed above  it has discontinued its investment in computer software and equipment that was designed to support its shared risk capitation business 
on november   the company announced a change in its strategic direction  which was to place more emphasis on its hospital based business and to reduce its emphasis on the primary care business  and its intent to dispose of non strategic office based physician practices 
due to this change in strategic direction  the company wrote down certain assets related to its office based operations to their estimated realizable values  and accrued certain liabilities for commitments that no longer have value to the company s future operations 
these adjustments resulted in a million charge to earnings in see note i to the company s consolidated financial statements for more information 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements include disclosure of net revenue and operating income for each of the company s two divisions  the hospital based services division and the office based services division 
under the company s new strategic direction  as discussed above  the company intends to integrate its hospital based and office based operations together by forming multi specialty physician networks that support its hospital customers 
the company expects that it will make investments and incur expenses in its office based operations that are designed to increase the earnings from its hospital based operations 
therefore  the company believes that it will no longer be meaningful to report operating income separately for these two divisions 
in addition  the company currently intends to sell several of its office based practices  as discussed above 
the company anticipates that after such practices are sold  its office based operations will be less material to its consolidated financial statements than they are currently 
therefore  the company does not expect to report operating income separately for these two divisions in the future 
as a result of the acquisition and several acquisitions of physician practices made by the company and its predecessor  goodwill constitutes a substantial percentage of the total assets of the company  and the company s results of operations include substantial expenses for goodwill amortization 
goodwill is the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets of those acquired businesses which net assets include any separately identifiable intangible assets 
as of december   the company s total assets were approximately million  of which approximately million  or  was goodwill 
of the total goodwill at december   million is related to the acquisition  and million is related to several acquisitions of physician practices completed by the predecessor and the company  as described above 
the goodwill related to the acquisition represents the going concern value of the company  which consists of the company s market position and reputation  its relationships with its customers and affiliated physicians  the relationships between its affiliated physicians and their patients  and other similar intangible assets 
since these assets are believed by the company to have useful lives of an indefinite length  and the company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would limit the useful lives of these assets  this goodwill is being amortized over years 
the company also acquired other intangible assets as part of the acquisition  including the value of the company s physician employee workforce  management team  non physician employee workforce and computer software 
these intangible assets have been capitalized separately from goodwill and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range from five to seven years 
the goodwill related to the acquisitions of physician practices also represents the going concern value of those practices 
however  since the going concern value of an individual physician practice  or a small group of practices  is subject to a higher degree of risk than the company as a whole and may be more adversely affected by changes in the health care industry  this goodwill is being amortized over shorter periods ranging from to years 
the company continuously evaluates all components of goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether there has been any impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or such other intangible assets or their useful lives 
the company is not aware of any such impairment at the current time  except for the impairment included in the million write down of office based net assets discussed above  which resulted primarily from the company s change in strategic direction

as a percentage of net revenue  direct facility expenses increased from in to in  primarily due to the acquired office based practices 
the acquired office based practices have higher direct facility expenses as a percentage of net revenue than the company s hospital based services business primarily because revenues received under the shared risk capitation arrangements under which certain of such practices operate include amounts which must  in turn  be paid by the company for specialist physician services and inpatient hospital services that are delivered by unaffiliated health care providers with which the company subcontracts 
the provision for bad debts increased  or  from million in to million in as a percentage of net revenue  the provision for bad debts decreased from in to in  primarily due to the fact that the acquired office based practices have relatively little bad debt expense as the majority of the net revenue from these practices consists of capitation payments  which are typically paid currently
