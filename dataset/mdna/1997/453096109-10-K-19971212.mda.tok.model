item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources following completion of the acquisition of savannah foods and closing of the financing transactions discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company will have term debt of approximately million and a million revolving credit facility 
the company s primary capital requirements are expected to include debt service  capital expenditures and working capital 
the primary sources of capital are expected to be cash flow from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
based upon current and anticipated future operations and anticipated future cost savings  the company believes that capital resources will be adequate to meet anticipated future capital requirements 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will generate sufficient cash flow that  together with the other sources of capital  will enable the company to service its indebtedness  or make anticipated capital expenditures 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service its debt  it may be required to sell assets  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of its existing indebtedness  or obtain additional financing 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company s financing arrangements entered into in connection with the acquisition of savannah foods will  and other debt instruments of the company may  pose various restrictions and covenants on the company which could potentially limit the company s ability to respond to market conditions  to provide for unanticipated capital investments  to raise additional debt or equity capital  or to take advantage of business opportunities 
the senior credit facility will incur interest at variable rates 
the company expects to enter into interest rate swap arrangements to limit its exposure to future increases in interest rates 
savannah foods currently has forward swap arrangements which may be utilized to cover a portion of this exposure 
the company s capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million  including the completion of major projects to expand the sidney  montana factory  as well as to add bulk sugar storage and high speed packaging equipment at the sugar land refinery 
the company  as a limited partner  and a washington sugarbeet growers cooperative  as the general partner  have formed a partnership which is building a new sugarbeet factory in moses lake  washington 
the company has made capital contributions and advances in the form of subordinated loans to the partnership of million and has contributed certain surplus production equipment 
the general partner has made capital contributions to the partnership of million and has contributed certain surplus equipment from an abandoned sugarbeet processing facility 
additionally  the company and the cooperative may be required to make further subordinated loans of up to million each  depending upon final construction costs 
the remainder of the million projected cash construction budget is expected to be financed by loans to the general partner who in turn will advance such funds to the partnership 
the company has developed plans to address the possible exposures related to the impact on its computer systems of the year key financial  information and operational systems have been assessed and plans are being implemented to modify or replace each affected system on a timely basis 
the financial impact of making the required systems changes is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

management is evaluating what  if any  additional disclosures may be required when these statements are implemented 
results of operations industry environment the company s results of operations are substantially dependent on market factors  including domestic prices for refined sugar and raw cane sugar 
these market factors are influenced by a variety of external forces  including the number of domestic acres contracted to grow sugar cane and sugarbeets  prices of competing crops  weather conditions and united states farm and trade policy  that the company is unable to predict 
certain segments of the beet sugar industry in the recent past have expanded sugarbeet acreage at rates exceeding the rate of growth in the demand for refined sugar  which along with large crop yields  put downward pressure on refined sugar prices 
smaller sugar beet crops in the fall of and increased refined sugar prices 
a larger crop in the fall of has more recently caused a decrease in the market prices for refined sugar 
the domestic sugar industry is subject to substantial influence by legislative and regulatory actions 
the current farm bill limits the importation of raw cane sugar  affecting the supply and cost of raw material available to the company s cane refineries 
see business sugar legislation and other market factors  competition and industry overview 
weather conditions during the growing  harvesting  processing and storage seasons  the availability of acreage to contract for sugarbeets  as well as the effects of diseases and insects  may materially affect the quality and quantity of sugar beets available for purchase as well as the costs of raw materials and processing 
see business raw materials and processing requirements 
combined future operations as a result of the completion of the acquisition of savannah foods  imperial holly s consolidated operating results will in the future include savannah foods  resulting in substantial increases in sales and costs  including the impact of interest on the higher level of indebtedness and increases in depreciation and amortization

a significant portion of imperial holly s industrial sales are made under fixed price  forward sales contracts  most of which commence october and extend for up to one year 
as a result  changes in imperial holly s realized sales prices for industrial sales tend to lag market price changes 
industrial sales contracts for the period beginning in october were written at lower prices than the prior contract year

imperial holly purchases sugar beets under participatory contracts which provide for a percentage sharing with the grower of the net selling price realized on refined beet sugar sales 
use of this type of contract reduces imperial holly s exposure to inventory price risk 
the increase in sales prices during the six month period resulted in an increase in the cost of sugar beets under the participatory purchase contracts  mitigating the improvement in gross margin

additionally  winter flooding disrupted rail service in northern california requiring the diversion of harvested beets in oregon and washington to imperial holly s sidney  montana factory 
the delays in processing these beets  as well as the sidney beets  affected beet quality and impacted processing  reducing sugar recovery and increasing costs several million dollars 
the increase in sales prices for beet sugar resulted in an increase in cost of sugar beets under the participatory purchase contracts described above
