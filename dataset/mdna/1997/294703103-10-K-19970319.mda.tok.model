funds from operations industry analysts generally consider funds from operations to be an appropriate measure of the performance of an equity reit 
in accordance with the resolution adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  funds from operations represent net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring or sales of property  plus depreciation  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
for the periods presented  depreciation and minority interest were the only non cash adjustments 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income or other measurements under generally accepted accounting principles as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements and debt service on the hotels 
the following reconciliation of income before minority interest to funds from operations illustrates the difference in the two measures of operating performance for the year for the year ended ended december  december  in thousands  except per share and unit data income before minority interest   add depreciation of buildings  furniture and fixtures   funds from operations   weighted average number of common shares and units outstanding   funds from operations per share and unit liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to its shareholders  is its cash distributions from the partnership 
the partnership receives cash payments from the lessee pursuant to the percentage leases 
the lessee s obligations under the percentage leases are guaranteed by interstate 
the company s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to shareholders  is dependent upon the lessee s ability to make payments under the percentage leases 
cash and cash equivalents were  at december   compared to  at december  excess cash balances are used to reduce the company s outstanding debt

the increased facility bears interest  at the company s option  at over   or day libor 
at december   the company had outstanding debt of approximately million under the line of credit  leaving approximately million available for future acquisitions 
at december   the line of credit was collateralized by first mortgages on of the hotels owned by the partnership and will be collateralized by additional hotels acquired in the future using proceeds from the line of credit 
the line of credit has been extended through november  with an additional one year option 
in january  the company established eqi financing partnership i  lp eqi finance  an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
eqi finance was established for the purpose of issuing million of fixed rate collateralized mortgage bonds in a private placement transaction 
on february   eqi finance issued million of rated commercial mortgage bonds bonds  as follows initial principal interest stated class amount rate maturity rating a million november  aa b million december  a c million february  bbb the combined interest rate for all three issues of bonds is fixed at 
proceeds from the issuance of these bonds were used to repay existing debt under the line of credit of approximately million and expenses of approximately million 
principal payments are to be applied to each class of bonds in order of their respective maturities with no principal payment on any bond until all bonds in a bond class with an earlier stated maturity have been paid in full 
the company expects to repay these bonds in full within years 
in connection with these transactions  the partnership transferred twenty three of its hotel properties and their respective leases to eqi finance as a capital contribution in return for a limited partnership interest 
the remaining interest is owned by eqi financing corporation  the sole general partner of eqi finance and a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the mortgage properties will secure the bonds 
during  the company spent million  including million in renovations required by franchisors  to fund capital improvements to its properties  including replacement of carpets  drapes  renovation of common areas and improvements of hotel exteriors 
in addition  the company has committed to fund approximately million in for capital improvements  million of which is renovations required by franchisors 
the company intends to fund such improvements out of future cash from operations  present cash balances and borrowings under its line of credit 
under the line of credit and the bonds  the partnership is obligated to fund of room revenues per quarter on a cumulative basis  to a separate room renovation account for the ongoing replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment at the hotels 
management believes that these amounts will be sufficient to fund required expenditures for the term of the percentage leases with the capital improvements anticipated and recurring repairs and maintenance performed by the lessee 
the company elected to be taxed as a reit  commencing with its taxable year ended december   and expects to continue to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of accordingly  no provision for federal income taxes has been reflected in the financial statements 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
for example  for federal income tax purposes  a reit  and therefore the company  is required to pay distributions of at least percent of its taxable income to its shareholders 
the company intends to pay these distributions from operating cash flows 
during  the partnership distributed an aggregate of million to its partners  or per unit including million of distributions to the company to fund distributions to shareholders of per share in

the company believes that its net cash provided by operations will be adequate to fund both operating requirements and payment of distributions by the company in accordance with reit requirements 
the company expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities and property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings  the issuance of additional equity securities of the company or  in connection with acquisitions of hotel properties  the issuance of partnership units 
inflation operators of hotels in general have the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
however  competitive pressures may limit the lessee s ability to raise room rates in the face of inflation 
seasonality hotel operations historically are seasonal in nature  reflecting higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly lease revenues to the extent that it receives percentage rent
