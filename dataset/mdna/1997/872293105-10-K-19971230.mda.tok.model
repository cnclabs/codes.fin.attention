item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company believes its business has been affected by the end of the cold war  which has permanently eroded the market demand for many of the company s traditional products 
because of the shift in focus from cold war driven planning on the part of many of its traditional customers  the company expects that large  long duration us government programs in defense intelligence and broadcasting will not return and that revenue from such contracts will generally constitute a smaller percentage of total revenue in future periods 
similarly  the company believes the long term market for ultra reliable hf communication systems will continue to diminish and will in the future be limited to predominantly overseas markets and commercial applications 
if not replaced by revenues from communication products or services with a broader and more modern market appeal  these changes in customer demand for its products will manifest themselves in permanent reductions in revenues and accompanying gross margins 
since  the company s product diversification efforts have focused principally on three areas 
the first two areas relate directly to proprietary elements of frequency management technology for use in commercial aviation and maritime communications applications 
the third area of diversification leverages the direction finding technology developed by tci principally for military applications into a world wide market for similar radio spectrum monitoring and surveillance equipment 
these systems are used by national regulatory agencies  similar to the federal communications commission fcc to maintain order and discipline in the radio spectrum 
additional efforts generally characterized by being smaller in scope and expenditure level have also been undertaken in the tv and fm broadcast equipment product area 
during fiscal  teamed with the hewlett packard company  the company achieved its first diversification success as it won a contract to supply radio spectrum monitoring and surveillance equipment to a foreign customer which was delivered in early in fiscal  again teamed with the hewlett packard company  the company won its second significant radio spectrum monitoring and surveillance contract 
in march of  in an effort to increase both its market share and the gross margins available  the company committed itself to replace the equipment previously supplied by the hewlett packard company with an all dsp based solution of proprietary origin and design 
the company is currently bidding this equipment configuration into various procurements and will continue to make investments in its related product line so as to increase its relative content and value added component 
the competitive nature of these procurements and the lengthy evaluation process are such that no assurances can be given that the company will win any of these opportunities or that these awards will be made to any supplier in the near future 
in  the company determined that due to certain attributes of the maritime communications market  including an assessment that an overabundance of satellite communications capacity is coming on line  the introduction of a world wide  maritime communications network using proprietary elements of the company s hf radio technology was not economically viable 
at that time  the company decided to halt the expenditure of development funds in this area 
while limited efforts continue to be made to find proprietary avenues for the use of the company s equipment in the commercial aviation market  any resultant suitable market for the company s products in this particular application is not expected to be large enough to materially affect future operating results 
during the last three years the company has expended approximately  on research and development efforts related to its product and market diversification efforts 
all costs for such product development are presently funded internally and are expensed as incurred 
the company expects that the future costs of these and other efforts including potential acquisitions may be significant enough to generate a loss from operations in fiscal while marketable products are not expected to be ready before late fiscal  at the earliest  the investment of financial and human resources will continue on each of the commercial efforts until either successful product introduction is achieved or it is determined that a viable market does not exist for these products 
the company s funded backlog as of september  was approximately million  compared to approximately million as of september  the following table sets forth the total backlog  which includes the value of unexercised options on us government contracts which the company believed were likely to be exercised  for the periods indicated in thousands as of september  backlog    of the million backlog at fiscal year end  approximately million is expected to be recognized as revenue prior to september  most contracts are  by their nature  subject to termination for reasons of cause or default  and on occasion  can be terminated for reasons beyond the control of the company 
approximately  of the  total backlog reported at fiscal year end is associated with two contract awards for the supply of spectrum monitoring and compliance systems for two foreign customers representing the company s first diversification success 
future growth in revenue and backlog is largelycontingent on the ability of the company to successfully execute its plans for product and market diversification 
results of operations as an aid to understanding the company s consolidated operating results  the following table indicates the percentage relationships of income and expense items for each of the last three fiscal years 
percentage of revenue years ended september  revenue operating costs and expenses cost of revenue marketing  general and administrative income loss from operations investment income  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes 
net income loss the approximate revenue attributable to contracts from both domestic and overseas customers is shown below in thousands domestic revenue    overseas revenue    total    in fiscal  largely due to the company s diversification success in the radio monitoring and spectrum compliance market  revenue continued its three year growth trend 
because more than of fiscal revenue came from radio and spectrum compliance programs  substantially all of the company s revenue growth can be seen to have come from its diversification efforts which have been focused entirely overseas 
more specifically  revenue from one commercial contract in the radio monitoring and spectrum compliance business area represented of the total revenue in fiscal the company anticipates that revenue may continue to grow modestly  particularly in the international sector  but that it will not return to the historical levels of years prior to fiscal without the company first achieving additional and broad based success with product and market diversification efforts 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded approximately  in non cash reductions to its inventory balance that are reflected in the cost of revenue figures included herein 
prior to these adjustments  the cost of revenues would have been  or of revenues for fiscal the majority of this inventory adjustment was made necessary by the recognition that customer demand for the existing br communications product line was weaker than previously expected 
a significant portion of the existing product line was originally designed for military and highly specialized communication purposes 
with increasing frequency  such communication requirements are being satisfied by the use of various commercial communications mediums which provide faster  more robust means of communicating  including secure satellite and other wireless communication technologies 
consequently  for the first time since the acquisition of br communications in  its backlog comprises an insignificant percentage of the company s total backlog principally due to a lack of contract opportunities in this area 
while there remains a limited number of order opportunities  the future prospects for the sale of existing product items in significant quantities is considered unlikely 
the company expects to continue to fill orders for existing products as they are received and to support the products it has sold by making the sale of spare parts available on an as required basis 
however  the company does not expect to carry substantial inventories for these purposes in the future 
ignoring the inventory adjustment made during the third quarter of  the cost of revenue in fiscal year was approximately higher than the previous year 
this is a reflection of executing a backlog which has a mix of inherently lower margin contracts associated with it which materialized because of competitive bidding pressures to be the low priced supplier 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  margins were further impacted due to a very small contribution to revenues and corresponding gross profit made by the br communications product line 
since  the company has experienced significant competitive bidding pressures to be the low priced supplier in its broadcast and spectrum management system product lines 
as a result  the company has experienced a corresponding reduction in gross margins that was initially seen in fiscal which has continued during fiscal gross margins expressed as a percentage of revenue are expected to stabilize but are not expected to return to pre fiscal levels until such time as new products are introduced which gain acceptance from customers in the form of new contracts 
in fiscal  marketing  general and administrative m  g a costs increased over previous year levels 
this increase reflects a continued emphasis being placed on marketing and selling related activities as well as a general increase in personnel costs 
the company anticipates quarter to quarter fluctuations in the amount of revenue recognized based upon the timing of receipt of material on its long term contracts as well as the timing of award of foreign business  and as a result  quarter to quarter comparisons of revenue and profitability are not particularly meaningful 
the revenue growth experienced in fiscal over the previous year is  similar to the trend  attributable to the success of the company s diversification programs 
revenues during each of the last three fiscal years have increasingly been comprised of international sources with fiscal international revenues approximately twice the level of fiscal international revenues 
due to forces similar to those experienced in fiscal and discussed herein  m  g a costs have grown at approximately per year since during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company booked a tax provision of  to cover its foreign tax liability associated with the execution of a certain contract in a south american country 
because no tax treaty exists between the us and most south american countries  such taxes are calculated without respect to the parent company s tax position in the us in this instance  the effect is to require the company to pay foreign source income taxes even though the us corporation is unprofitable 
these taxes can be used to offset foreign source income generated by the company before after the available net operating loss nol is first used to offset future tax liabilities 
prior to fiscal and after fiscal  the company reduced its payment of income taxes by offsetting these liabilities with an nol carryforward originally generated in fiscal as a result  the effective tax rate incurred by the company in fiscal   and was   and respectively 
at the end of fiscal  the company had approximately xxxxxxxx  of nol remaining which to the extent it is able to generate profits the company intends to use the remaining nol to offset tax liabilities in future fiscal years 
if the company is unable to generate profits against which the nol would be utilized to offset a corresponding tax liability  the current nol would expire in a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset due to the lack of consistent earnings history for the company 
expenditures for independent research and development ir d were approximately   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
in addition to ir d  a significant portion of engineering effort is customer sponsored by both cost reimbursement and fixed price contracts 
such engineering effort relates to the design and development of new products as well as improvements to existing products 
expenditures for customer sponsored research  development  and engineering were approximately   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
additionally  a portion of new product development work of a conceptual nature is charged to bid and proposal costs when the development has an immediate  potential customer 
ir d and bid and proposal costs are included in m  g a expenses in the statements of operations 
during the past three fiscal years  a substantial part of the company s net income has been derived from interest income from its various investments 
because the company plans to expend significant funds on its product and market diversification efforts  and because the precise timing of payments due on existing contracts and the receipt of down payments on new contracts is difficult to predict  the company believes investment income may decline and may not return to current levels until such time as the company begins generating positive cash flows from its diversification activities 
factors that may affect future operating results the company operates in a highly competitive environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons 
while there is no seasonality to the company s business  because of the company s relative small size  combined with the extended delivery cycles of its long term project oriented business  revenue and accompanying gross margins are inherently difficult to predict 
because the company plans its operating expenses  many of which are relatively fixed in the short term  based on the assumption of stable performance  a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause profitability from operations to suffer 
historically  the company has endured periods of volatility in its revenue results due to a number of factors  including shortfalls in new orders  delays in the availability of new products  delays in subcontractor provided materials and services  and delays associated with foreign construction activities 
gross margins are strongly influenced by a mix of considerations  including pressures to be the low price supplier in competitive bid solicitations  the mix of contract material and non recurring engineering services  and the mix of newly developed and existing product sold to various customers 
the company believes these historical challenges will continue to affect its future business 
during fiscal  the company formed a wholly owned subsidiary  tciw  to provide wireless communication services to the maritime and commercial aviation markets using proprietary equipment developed by the company and facilities and bandwidth provided by various coast station operators around the world 
since its formation  the company has determined that an opportunity to provide a world wide maritime communications network using elements of its proprietary products was not economically viable  and as a result  ceased expenditures on this activity during early fiscal the company intends  however  to leverage its expertise in rf technology applications and its ability to conduct business in foreign markets by pursuing outside technology and business acquisitions which complement various characteristics of its existing core businesses 
the company expects that the future cost of this product diversification strategy may be significant enough to generate a loss from operations during any quarter between now and at least the end of fiscal managing a changing business the company is in the process of adopting a business management plan that includes substantial investments in its sales and marketing organizations  increased funding of existing internal research and development programs  and certain investments in corporate infrastructure that will be required to support the company s diversification objectives during the next three years 
accompanying this process are a number of risks  including a higher level of operating expenses  the difficulty of competing with companies of larger size for talented technical personnel  and the complexities of managing a changing business 
there also exists the risk the company may inaccurately estimate the viability of any one or all of its diversification efforts and as a result  may experience substantial revenue shortfalls of a size so significant as to generate losses from operations 
risk associated with expansion into additional markets and product development the company believes that its future success is substantially dependent on its ability to successfully acquire  develop and commercialize new products and penetrate new markets 
in addition to the company s ongoing efforts to diversify its product offerings within its core businesses such as the spectrum management system business  the company intends to pursue a diverse  but focused product and market development initiative during the next three years 
the company believes that its general knowledge of rf technology and its related applications combined with its proven ability to conduct business in overseas markets can be exploited to return the company to an aggressive growth posture 
while not strictly limited to these product areas  the company is currently pursuing various rural communication and telephony applications using its proprietary technology  certain transmitter product initiatives in the fm  tv and wireless cable tv markets which compliment the company s antenna expertise and certain rf technologies with potential application in the markets of tracking various kinds of assets in indoor and outdoor settings 
there can be no assurance that the company can successfully develop these or any other additional products  that any such products will be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable cost  or that any such products will achieve market acceptance 
should the company expend funds to acquire outside entities or technology  there can be no assurance that sufficient returns will be realized to offset these investments 
the inability of the company to successfully develop or commercialize new products or failure of such products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with conducting business overseas a substantial part of the company s revenue are derived from fixed priced contracts with foreign governmental entities 
with increasing frequency  the company finds a demand for its products in third world countries and developing nations which have an inherently more volatile and uncertain political and credit risk profile than the us government market with which the company is accustom to conducting its business 
while the company seeks to minimize the collection risks on these contracts by normally securing significant advanced payments with the balance secured by irrevocable letters of credit  the company cannot always be assured of receiving full payment for work that it has performed due to unforeseen credit and political risks 
the company is in the process of executing contract obligations in a number of countries that have been subjected to substantial devaluations of currency during the last fiscal year 
while the majority of payments owed the company are made in us dollars and are secured before product shipment with irrevocable letters of credit  scenarios could occur that make it difficult for the company to collect all the money owed against the payment of a given contract 
should such a default on payments owed the company ever occur  a significant effect on earnings  cash flows and cash balances may result 
competition most all of the company s products are positioned in niche markets which include strong elements of imbedded proprietary technology 
in most of these markets  the company competes with companies of significantly larger size  many of whom have substantially greater technical  marketing  and financial resources compared to similar resources available within the company 
this type of competition has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in significant price competition 
liquidity and capital resources cash used in operations in fiscal and fiscal were million and thousand  respectively 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal in fiscal  cash used in operations resulted primarily from a net loss of million which included a non cash inventory adjustment of million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to the timing of milestone and final billings on various contracts 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations resulted primarily from a net income of million  an increase in accounts payable of million and customer deposit and billing on uncompleted contracts in excess of revenue recognized of million 
in fiscal  cash was provided from a net income of million  offset by an increase in accounts payable of million resulting in a net cash used in operation of thousand 
cash of million was provided from investing activities in fiscal through the maturity of short term investments 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal and was and million  respectively 
this is due to the purchase of short term and long term investments 
as of september   the company had approximately million in cash and short term investments 
as of the same date  the company had standby letters of credit outstanding totaling approximately million 
these standby letters of credit are collateralized by the company s cash or short term investments 
see further discussion in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company currently believes that its cash and expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund its operations through fiscal a significant portion of the company s sales are associated with long term contracts and programs in which there are significant inherent risks 
these risks include the uncertainty of economic conditions  dependence on future appropriations and administrative allotments of funds  changes in governmental policies  difficulty of forecasting costs and work schedules  product obsolescence  and other factors characteristic of the industry 
contracts with agencies of the us government or with prime contractors working on us government contracts contain provisions permitting termination at any time for the convenience of the government 
no assurance can be given regarding future financial results as such results are dependent upon many factors  including economic and competitive conditions  incoming order levels  shipment volume  product margins and foreign exchange rates 
the large size of certain of the company s orders makes it possible that a single contract termination  cancellation  delay  or failure to perform could have a significant adverse effect on revenue  results of operations  and the cash position of the company 
a portion of the company s revenues are derived from governments in areas of political instability 
the company generally attempts to reduce the risks associated with such instability by requesting advance payments if appropriate  as well as letters of credit or central government guarantees 
most of the company s overseas contracts provide for payments in us dollars 
however  in certain instances the company  for competitive reasons  must accept payment in a foreign currency 
management does not consider inflation to be a significant factor in its operations
