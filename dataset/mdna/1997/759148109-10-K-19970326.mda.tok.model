item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company changed its fiscal year end from the last day of february to december  effective as of december  the change resulted in a short period of ten months that began march   and ended december  information for calendar refers to the ten months ended december   and fiscal and fiscal refers to the twelve months ended the last day of february for the respective years 
the growth in the company s operating revenues and net earnings during calendar was the result of an increase in the number of subacute units and results from hssi 
calendar reflects an increase in the average number of subacute units managed by the company from to outpatient revenue decreased in calendar  reflecting the closure of three locations 
the growth for fiscal was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of subacute units  increased outpatient locations and an increase in the percentage of acute rehabilitation units exempt from pps 
outpatient revenue increased in fiscal  reflecting the acquisition on october  of rosi  which initially added seven outpatient locations 
in the normal course of business  new units are opened and some existing units are closed each year 
during the first year of operation  a new acute rehabilitation unit will typically be subject to limitations in reimbursement from medicare considerably below the hospital s operating cost 
as a consequence  during this period the company agrees with the client hospital to bear certain start up costs on the hospital s behalf and to waive a portion of its fees until the unit qualifies for an exemption from medicare limitations 
the company assists the hospital in qualifying the unit for the exemption and in minimizing the unreimbursed costs during this non exempt period 
the company s average operating losses during the qualifying period can range to as high as  to  per unit 
if the company does not obtain an exemption for the unit  the contract may be terminated and  in the event of termination  start up losses would generally not be recoverable 
upon completion of the qualifying year and obtaining the exemption  the hospital is eligible to recover all of its costs related to the operation of the unit  including the company s fees under the management contract 
once a unit becomes exempt  the unit experiences accelerated growth in operating revenues and profitability as the patient population is expanded in response to the more favorable reimbursement terms 
in addition to growing its acute rehabilitation units  the company expects significant future growth to take place through opening subacute units and outpatient programs under contracts with acute care hospitals 
these units and programs are not subject to the same limitations in reimbursement from medicare as acute rehabilitation units and  therefore  should result in significantly reduced start up losses per unit 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company issued a  three year subordinated promissory note and  in cash to acquire rosi 
on march  the company acquired hssi 
the aggregate purchase price of  paid at closing included  in cash  a  ten year convertible subordinated promissory note and  shares of the company s common stock 
additional consideration will be paid to the hssi stockholders contingent upon the attainment of certain target cumulative earnings before interest and income taxes up to a maximum of  in additional consideration over six years 
the transactions were accounted for as purchases and  as such  the company s consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations of rosi and hssi commencing with the consummation date of each acquisition 
on january   the company acquired team and moore 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and  as such  the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the ten months ended december   do not reflect the financial condition and results of operations of team and moore 
the company s future consolidated financial statements will reflect their financial condition as of such reporting dates  and the results of operations commencing on the consummation date of the acquisition 
on january   the company made a tender offer to purchase up to  shares of its common stock at a single purchase price  not less than nor in excess of per share  the purchase price to be selected by the company based on prices specified by tendering stockholders at the lowest single purchase price sufficient to purchase  shares 
as of february   the closing date  shares totaling greater than  were tendered  resulting in the company s repurchase on march  of a total of  shares at single per share price of per share 
to finance the repurchase and restructure its current debt  the company obtained financing from a syndicate of financial institutions totaling million in senior secured debt  comprising a million term loan and million revolving credit facility 
as of december   a change in method of recording accounts receivable and accrued expenses at hssi was implemented which resulted in a decrease in the related balance sheet accounts 
operating results were not materially affected
