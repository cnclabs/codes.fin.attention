item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  without limitation  those discussed in item business  including the section entitled risk factors  as well as those discussed in any documents incorporated herein by reference 
since its inception in july  cytel has devoted substantially all of its resources to the discovery and development of its potential immunotherapeutic products 
to date  cytel has not received any revenues from the sale of products 
the company has funded its research and development primarily from equity derived working capital and through strategic alliances with other companies 
the company has been unprofitable since its inception and expects to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years 
as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was million 
results of operations the company had total revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in total revenues decreased million or in from and increased million or in from revenues in each year consisted mainly of research and development revenues  which were million in  million in and million in research and development revenues for consisted of funding received under the company s collaborative research agreements with sumitomo  schwarz and abbott  as well as a new collaboration with nextran 
information regarding these collaborative agreements is contained in development and marketing arrangements in item of part i of this annual report on form k 
research and development revenues for resulted from the company s collaborative research agreements with sumitomo  takara  schwarz  p u and abbott 
research and development revenues for consisted of collaborative research funding from sumitomo  takara  and other amounts received from third parties 
research grant revenues were million in  million in and million in the company had operating expenses for the year ended december  of million  compared to million in  excluding non recurring non cash charges of million  and million in operating expenses increased million or in from and decreased million or in from the non recurring  non cash charges totaling million were for acquired in process research and development relating to the acquisition of rli in july  and the acquisition of scripps minority interest in sequel therapeutics  inc in october both acquisitions were completed in exchange for cytel stock 
research and development expenses increased million or to million in from million in and decreased million or in from million in the increase in from reflects the increased costs associated with the company s clinical trials 
the decrease in from was due to a continued company wide effort to control costs 
additionally  the decrease reflects the expiration of the genencor research and development agreement in the third quarter of general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in this decrease was primarily due to the company s cost reduction efforts during and net interest income was million during compared to million in and million in the decrease in from was primarily attributable to a lower average cash balance in the increase in from was attributable to a higher average cash balance in  due to proceeds from the collaborative research agreements entered into during cytel expects to incur substantial operating losses over the next several years due to continuing and increasing expenses associated with its research and development programs  including preclinical testing and clinical trials 
operating losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of revenues received and expenses incurred  and such fluctuations may be substantial 
liquidity and capital resources cytel has financed operations since inception primarily through private placements of its equity securities  two public common stock offerings  revenues under collaborative research and development agreements  grant revenues and interest income 
during  nextran  one of the company s research and development collaborators  made an equity investment in the company totaling million 
through december  the company has raised approximately million from the sale of equity securities 
the company has financed its laboratory equipment and research and office facilities primarily through capital and operating lease arrangements 
the company had net working capital of million as of december  compared to million as of december  as of december   the company s cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments decreased to million from million at december  the decrease was due to expenditures for the development of the company s priority drug candidates and the company s research programs 
cash used by operating activities in was million compared to million in  due primarily to increased costs associated with the clinical trials combined with lower research and development revenues from collaborators 
capital expenditures  primarily for laboratory equipment  totaled million in compared to million in the increase was due primarily to the million expenditure to improve and equip the laboratory space leased in conjunction with the acquisition of rli in the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are expected to decline primarily due to the continued clinical development of its immunotherapeutic product candidates and the conduct of its research programs 
while the company s investments may periodically reflect unrealized losses  management attempts to schedule the maturities of the company s investments to coincide with the company s expected cash requirements 
the company expects to incur substantial additional research and development expenditures  including costs related to preclinical testing  clinical trials and manufacturing  as well as marketing and distribution expenses 
it is the company s intention to seek additional collaborative research and development relationships with suitable corporate partners 
there can be no assurance that any agreements that may result from these discussions will successfully reduce the company s funding requirements 
additional equity or debt financing will be required  and there can be no assurance that these funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of its drug discovery or development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates or products that the company would not otherwise relinquish 
if additional financing is not available  cytel anticipates its existing available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  investment income and research and development funding from collaborative agreements and research grants will be adequate to satisfy its capital requirements and fund operating losses through at least the beginning of the company s future capital requirements depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in its drug discovery programs  the magnitude of these programs  progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  changes in the existing collaborative research relationships  the ability of the company to establish and maintain development arrangements  the cost of manufacturing scale up and effective commercialization activities and arrangements 
as is typical in the biotechnology industry  the commercial success of the company will depend in part on the company neither infringing patents issued to competitors nor breaching the technology licenses upon which the company s products might be based 
the company is aware of third party patent applications and issued patents that may require the company to alter products or processes  obtain licenses or cease certain activities 
based on preliminary investigation  the company believes that its compound cylexin  which is currently in phase ii clinical trials for infants undergoing surgery to correct congenital heart defects  may infringe one or more claims of a patent issued to a third party 
the company is continuing to investigate the validity and scope of the patent 
subject to this further investigation  the company believes that it may be required to either obtain a license from the third party in order to manufacture and market cylexin or  alternatively  to shift its development effort to another compound with attendant delay 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to obtain any necessary license at a reasonable cost or that it can successfully develop an alternative compound and obtain fda approval for it 
failure by the company to obtain a license to any technology that it requires to commercialize its products  or to develop an alternative compound and obtain fda approval within an acceptable period of time if required to do so  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s business is also subject to other significant risks  including the uncertainties associated with the lengthy regulatory approval process and with potential competition from other products 
even if the company s products appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
such reasons include  but are not limited to  the possibilities that the potential products will be found ineffective during clinical trials  fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  or be uneconomical to market
