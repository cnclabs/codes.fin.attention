item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those set forth in such forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth under factors that may affect future results and other risks detailed from time to time in the company s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
overview the company is the leading worldwide provider of semiconductor based photocoagulator systems used to treat eye diseases  including the three leading causes of irreversible blindness 
the company s current oculight systems consist of a semiconductor based infrared laser console the oculight sl and oculight slx and a semiconductor based visible laser console the oculight gl along with interchangeable delivery devices  including disposable products 
the oculight gl was first shipped for revenue in september since  when its first fda cleared infrared oculight sl system was shipped  more than  oculight systems have been sold worldwide 
during the past seven years  the company has steadily expanded its product line and has introduced new products each year to address a broader segment of the ophthalmic market 
these new products have contributed to increased sales levels and expansion of its customer base 
as the installed base of its oculight consoles grows  the company expects that sales of its disposable products may increase 
the company s sales consist of the purchase price of its oculight system consoles and delivery devices  disposables and  to a lesser extent  revenues from service and support activities 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized at the time of shipment net of allowances or discounts  while revenue from services is recognized upon performance of the applicable services 
the company s sales have increased primarily due to growth in unit sales  including additional unit sales resulting from the introduction of the oculight gl during the second half of  greater market penetration and an expanded product offering 
the company believes that future growth in unit sales will be derived both from a growth in the market for photocoagulator products and from the replacement of installed photocoagulators which use vacuum tube based technology 
sales in the united states are derived from direct sales to end users and internationally are derived from sales to distributors who resell to hospitals and physicians 
sales to international distributors are made on open credit terms or letters of credit and generally are not subject to a right of return unless the company terminates a distributor 
the company believes its distributors carry minimal inventory 
although sales of the company s products internationally currently are denominated in united states dollars  international sales are subject to a variety of risks including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  shipping delays  generally longer receivables collection periods  changes in applicable regulatory policies  international monetary conditions  domestic and foreign tax policies  trade restrictions  duties and tariffs and economic and political instability 
these factors are ameliorated somewhat because the company has sold its products internationally in countries 
accordingly  to date  the company has not experienced any material impact on its results of operations due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the other factors set forth above 
cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of purchasing components and sub systems  assembling  packaging and testing components at the company s facility  and the direct labor and overhead associated therewith 
cost of service and support consists of expenses related directly to service  support and training activities 
product development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  materials and research support provided to clinicians at medical institutions developing new applications which utilize the company s products 
research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs of personnel  sales commissions  travel expenses  advertising and promotional expenses  facilities  legal and accounting  insurance and other expenses which are not allocated to other departments 
prior to  the company had not incurred any substantial income tax liability because of its historical operating losses 
however  during  the company utilized its remaining net operating loss carryforwards and began incurring income taxes at statutory tax rates

sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to the growth in sales in over was primarily attributable to increased unit volume as the company expanded its product offering and broadened its customer base  offset somewhat by slight decreases in average selling prices 
the increase in over is attributable to the same factors  with the addition that unit volume increase were primarily due to the introduction of the oculight gl in the second half of the year 
international sales accounted for  and in  and  respectively 
the company expects revenues from international sales to continue to account for a substantial portion of its sales 
the lack of availability of a critical component utilized in the manufacture of the oculight gl negatively impacted sales 
while supplies of this component have improved  delays in delivery and short falls in quantities ordered by the company are continuing to negatively impact the company s ability to ship its oculight gl product 
the company is currently qualifying a second source for this component and expects to commence shipments of products incorporating this alternative sourced component in the second quarter of gross profit 
gross profit was million  million and million in  and representing  and of sales in each of such periods  respectively 
gross profit improved in as compared to in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales primarily due to higher sales volume and improved economies of scale 
the gross margins in compared to were higher in absolute dollars but lower as a percentage of sales primarily due to the costs associated with starting up manufacturing of the new oculight gl 
increasing competition has resulted in a downward trend in average selling prices 
the company expects continued competitive pressure on the prices of its products 
the company intends to continue its efforts to reduce the cost of components and thereby mitigate the impact of price reductions on its gross margin 
margins are also expected to increase as volumes increase  critical components are received on schedule and costs are engineered out of the new product 
gross margins will fluctuate due to changes in the relative proportions of domestic and international sales  costs associated with future product introductions and a variety of other factors 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by in to  and by in to  from  in  representing  and of sales in these periods  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel as the company increased its product development efforts 
during  a higher level of expense was incurred primarily in connection with the development of the oculight gl and another new product planned for introduction during sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expenses grew by in to million and by to million in from million in the increases in sales  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to the hiring of additional sales and marketing employees to address new sales opportunities and to support expanding unit volumes  higher sales commissions and the growth in the infrastructure of the company s finance  administrative and operations group which were necessary to support the company s expanded operations 
costs associated with the launch of the oculight gl during also increased sale and marketing expenses during this period 
in addition  general and administrative expenses increased due to recruiting and relocation costs associated with hiring a chief financial officer  expenses related to the company s initial public offering in february and the establishment of a returns and allowance reserve 
nonrecurring charge for acquisition of technology 
in the fourth quarter of  the company wrote off  or of sales in  of in progress research and development costs in connection with an acquisition 
interest income 
interest income  was   and  in  and  respectively 
this income was primarily from interest earned on short term investments 
increased interest income was primarily due to increased levels of investments 
income taxes 
the company had an effective tax rate of  and in   and  respectively 
the rates for and differ from the statutory rate of primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses

liquidity and capital resources in february  the company sold  shares of its common stock in connection with its initial public offering ipo 
the net proceeds of this offering were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of the offering 
the company has used a portion of the net proceeds from the ipo for purchases of inventory  leasehold improvements and payment of certain accrued liabilities 
from january  the company has funded the operations primarily from cash generated from operations 
net cash provided from operations totaled approximately  and  in and  respectively  and net cash used in operations totaled  in the company used approximately  in investing activities primarily for available for sale securities in and approximately  and  in investing activities primarily for the acquisition of fixed assets in and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities during was  which consisted primarily of proceeds from the company s ipo 
net cash used in financing activities in and consisted of approximately  and  respectively  primarily for the repayment of funds previously borrowed under the company s bank line of credit 
at december   the company s primary sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
in addition  the company has available  under its unsecured line of credit which bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus and expires in september the company believes that  based on current estimates  its current cash balances  short term investments net cash provided by operating activities and credit facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through during the year ended december   the company used million in operating activities 
sources of cash included net income of million offset by increases in inventories of 
million and increases in accounts receivable of million 
the increase in inventories is primarily due to the purchase of components for the oculight gl  shipments of which were unexpectedly delayed in the third quarter due to delays in receipt of fda approval  the unavailability of a sole source component and to purchases of components for the company s other products 
during  while the company waited for fda approval of the oculight gl  the company built up its inventory of the oculight sl in order to be able to allocate substantial manufacturing resources to producing the oculight gl 
when the introduction of the oculight gl was delayed due to delays in fda approval and the inability to obtain certain components  the company experienced increases in inventory levels and manufacturing labor inefficiencies 
the company expects to continue to devote most of its manufacturing capacity to the assembly of the oculight gl during the first half of the company expects to reduce inventory of the oculight sl over the first half of factors that may affect future results dependence on visible photocoagulator 
the company introduced a new semiconductor based photocoagulator system  the oculight gl  in the second half of the company devoted significant resources to the development and commercial introduction of the oculight gl 
the company believes that the continued growth of its sales  if any  will be substantially dependent upon sales of this visible light laser system 
while the oculight gl has been successfully introduced  the company has continued to face risks associated with developing and manufacturing a new product 
for example  the company experienced delays in its manufacturing of the oculight gl due to the inability of a supplier of a sole source component to deliver components in volume and on a timely basis 
the company has worked with this supplier to resolve these difficulties and is also actively qualifying a second source for that component 
the company expects to ship products incorporating components from this second source by the second quarter of other difficulties may occur  for example  despite testing by the company  quality and reliability problems may arise which may result in reduced bookings  manufacturing rework costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable  additional service and warranty costs and a decline in the company s competitive position 
moreover  the company believes that recommendations by ophthalmologists and clinicians for use of this laser will be essential for its continued market acceptance 
while the company believes that the oculight gl has been generally accepted by the market  ophthalmologists and clinicians may not recommend this laser or related treatments unless they conclude  based upon clinical data and other factors  that it is a beneficial alternative to other technologies and treatments  including more established argon gas lasers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manufacture this visible laser system has been on a cost effective  timely basis or that it will achieve widespread market acceptance 
additionally  the oculight gl competes directly with established on based and other photocoagulator systems currently sold by the company s competitors and new systems being introduced by competitors and the company expects to continue to experience significant competitive pressures 
failure of the oculight gl system to achieve widespread market acceptance for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on continued market acceptance of infrared photocoagulators 
prior to the third quarter of  substantially all of the company s revenues had been derived from sales of its oculight diode laser photocoagulator system the oculight sl system  an infrared  invisible light  semiconductor based laser console and interchangeable delivery devices  into the ophthalmic medical device market 
the ophthalmic community historically has used argon gas photocoagulators which produce visible light and the substantial majority of photocoagulators sold for ophthalmic purposes are argon gas 
because sales of the company s oculight sl system represent a significant portion of the infrared laser market  increased sales of the company s infrared system will depend on the rate at which users convert to infrared photocoagulators 
equipment purchasing decisions may be based on a number of factors  in addition to price and performance 
for example  many ophthalmologists have been trained in medical school to use visible lasers and may be reticent to change to infrared lasers 
there can be no assurance that the oculight sl system will continue to be accepted by the market or that other competitive treatments will not be developed  and therefore that sales derived from the oculight sl system will continue to grow at historical rates or be sustainable at current sales levels 
any decline in the demand for the oculight sl system or any failure of sales derived from such products to meet the company s expectations would have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations and financial condition of the company 
management of growth 
with the introduction of the oculight gl  the company has recently experienced  and may continue to experience growth in production  the number of its employees  the scope of its operating and financial systems and the geographic area of its operations 
this growth has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and has placed and continues to place a significant strain upon the company s management  operating  inventory and financial systems and resources 
to accommodate recent growth and to compete effectively and manage future growth  if any  the company has been required to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems  procedures and controls and to expand  train  motivate and manage its work force 
the company has been implementing a new management information system in manufacturing and expects to continue this implementation throughout the company through the company s future success will depend on the successful installation of this system as well as on the ability of its current and future executive officers to operate effectively  both independently and as a group 
there can be no assurance that the company s personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s existing and future operations 
any failure to implement and improve the company s operational  financial and management systems or to expand  train  motivate or manage employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  the company is in the process of relocating to a larger facility 
there can be no assurance that the company s operations will not be disrupted during such move  possibly causing a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
dependence on development of new products and new applications 
the company s future success is dependent upon  among other factors  its ability to develop  obtain regulatory approval  manufacture and introduce on a timely and cost effective basis as well as successfully sell and achieve market acceptance of new products and applications and enhanced versions of existing products 
the extent of  and rate at which  market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products  is a function of many variables  including price  safety  efficacy  reliability  marketing and sales efforts  the development of new applications for these products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
in  the company developed a new product which is intended to be used in the dermatology market to treat vascular and pigmented skin lesions 
the new product  the diolite will deliver pulsed laser power through a variety of fiber optic delivery device handpieces 
the company has submitted a k notification for the diolite there can be no assurance that the fda will not require clinical data or that the fda will grant k clearance in a timely manner  if at all 
even if the company s products receive fda clearance or approval  there can be no assurance that such products will achieve clinical acceptance or that the company can successfully manage the introduction of such product into the dermatology market  a market that the company s products do not currently address and in which the company has no experience 
the failure of the company to successfully develop and introduce new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company is seeking to expand the market for its existing and new products by working with clinicians and third parties to identify new applications for its products  validating new procedures which utilize its products and responding more effectively to new procedures 
there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to develop new applications for its products will be successful  that it can obtain regulatory approvals to use its products in new clinical applications in a timely manner  or at all  or gain satisfactory market acceptance for such new applications 
failure to develop and achieve market acceptance of new applications would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on key manufacturers and suppliers 
the company relies on third parties to manufacture substantially all of the components used in its products  although the company assembles critical subassemblies as well as the final product at its facility in mountain view  california 
there are risks associated with the use of independent manufacturers  including unavailability of or delays in obtaining adequate supplies of components and potentially reduced control of quality  production costs and the timing of delivery 
the company has qualified two or more sources for most of the components used in its products 
certain semiconductor laser components purchased from sdl  inc sdl are not readily available from other suppliers 
during last half and first quarter the company has experienced delays in its manufacturing of the oculight gl due to the inability of sdl to deliver components in volume and on a timely basis 
the company is working with this supplier to resolve these difficulties and is actively working to qualify a second source for this component and other components 
the company expects to commence products incorporating this alternative sourced component in the second quarter of the process of qualifying suppliers is ongoing  particularly as new products are introduced and may be lengthy 
the company does not have long term or volume purchase agreements with any of its suppliers and currently purchases components on a purchase order basis 
no assurance can be given that these components will be available in the quantities required by the company  on reasonable terms  or at all 
establishing its own capabilities to manufacture these components would require significant scale up expenses and additions to facilities and personnel and could significantly decrease the company s profit margins 
the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if it is unable to continue to obtain components as required at a reasonable cost fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
although the company has been profitable on an annual and quarterly basis for the last four years  the company s sales and operating results have varied substantially on a quarterly basis and such fluctuations are expected to continue in future periods 
the company believes that its gross margins in will continue to be lower than gross margins in  primarily because of increases in fixed costs incurred to support expansion of the company s business  costs associated with the oculight gl and the downward trend in average selling prices  primarily due to increased competition 
in addition  the company expects international sales of the oculight gl to exceed domestic sales of this product during the first quarter of the gross margins on international shipments of the oculight gl are significantly lower than the gross margins on domestic shipments of the oculight gl  primarily due distributor discounts 
additionally  the company expects to continue to incur increased operating expenses in the first half of associated with the introduction of the oculight gl 
such increases may result in lower operating margins in the first half of slightly offset by a higher percentage of sales to domestic customers 
the ability of the company to increase its operating margins during the first half of and thereafter will depend primarily on continued receipt of sole source components and qualification of a second source  successful and timely manufacturing of the oculight gl and continued market acceptance of the oculight gl as well as increased sales of the oculight sl systems 
the company s operating results are affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
factors contributing to these fluctuations include the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by the company and its competitors  the cost and availability of components and subassemblies  changes in pricing by the company and its competitors  the timing of the development and market acceptance of new applications for the company s products  the relatively long and highly variable sales cycle for the company s products to hospitals and other health care institutions  fluctuations in economic and financial market conditions and resulting changes in customers or potential customers budgets and increased product development costs 
any inability to obtain adequate quantities of a sole source component for the oculight gl would adversely impact the company s ability to ship the oculight gl 
in addition to these factors  the company s quarterly results have been and are expected to continue to be affected by seasonal factors 
the company manufactures its products to forecast rather than to outstanding purchase orders  and products are typically shipped shortly after receipt of a purchase order 
while backlog increased in because of manufacturing difficulties associated with the company s new product  the company does not expect significant backlog in the future and the amount of backlog at any particular date is generally not indicative of its future level of sales 
although the company s manufacturing procedures are designed to assure rapid response to customer orders  they may in certain instances create a risk of excess or inadequate inventory levels if orders do not match forecasts 
the company increased its inventory of the oculight sl system during the first three quarters of in anticipation of allocating substantial manufacturing resources to produce the oculight gl in the fourth quarter of the company expects to reduce inventory of the oculight sl through the second half of the company s expense levels are based  in part  on expected future sales 
if sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  the company may be unable to adjust operating expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall  and the company s results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  the company has historically made a significant portion of each quarter s product shipments near the end of the quarter 
if that pattern continues  even short delays in shipment of products at the end of a quarter could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for such quarter 
as a result of the above factors  sales for any future quarter are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy and operating results in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
there can be no assurance that the company will remain profitable in the future or that operating results will not vary significantly 
competition 
competition in the market for devices used for ophthalmic treatments is intense and is expected to increase 
this market is also characterized by rapid technological innovation and change and the company s products could be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations 
the company s competitive position depends on a number of factors including product performance  characteristics and functionality  ease of use  scalability  durability and cost 
in addition to photocoagulators  the company competes with pharmaceuticals  other technologies and other surgical techniques 
although many of the company s current competitors do not currently sell semiconductor lasers such as those used in the company s products  such competitors could incorporate these semiconductor lasers into their products in the future and compete directly with the company 
the company s principal competitors are coherent  inc  nidek  zeiss  keeler and hgm medical laser systems  inc 
of these companies  only nidek  zeiss and keeler currently offer a semiconductor based laser system 
other competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  product development  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than the company 
such companies also have greater name recognition than the company and long standing customer relationships 
in addition  there can be no assurance that other medical companies  academic and research institutions or others will not develop new technologies or therapies  including medical devices  surgical procedures or pharmacological treatments and obtain regulatory approval for products utilizing such techniques that are more effective in treating the ophthalmic conditions targeted by the company or are less expensive than the company s current or future products  and that the company s technologies and products would not be rendered obsolete by such developments 
any such developments could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
dependence on collaborative relationships 
the company has entered into collaborative relationships with academic medical centers and physicians in connection with the research and development and clinical testing of its products 
the company plans to collaborate with third parties to develop and commercialize existing and new products 
in may  the company executed an agreement with pdt  a maker of photodynamic drugs  under which the company and pdt will collaborate to develop a device which will emit a laser beam to activate a photodynamic drug being developed by pdt to achieve a desired therapeutic result 
the development of this new photodynamic system will require at least three years and significant financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that this collaborative development effort will continue or that it will result in the successful development and introduction of a photodynamic system 
the company believes that these current and future relationships are important because they would allow the company greater access to funds  to research  development and testing resources and to manufacturing  sales and distribution resources 
however  the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities are not within the company s control 
there can be no assurance that such parties will perform their obligations as expected or that the company s reliance on others for clinical development  manufacturing and distribution of its products will not result in unforeseen problems 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s collaborative partners will not develop or pursue alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others  including the company s competitors  as a means of developing or marketing products for the diseases targeted by the collaborative programs and by the company s products 
the failure of any current or future collaboration efforts could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to introduce new products or applications and therefore could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on international sales 
the company derives  and expects to continue to derive  a large portion of its revenue from international sales 
in  and  the company s international sales were million  million  and million  or  and  respectively  of total sales 
therefore  a large portion of the company s revenues will continue to be subject to the risks associated with international sales  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  shipping delays  generally longer receivables collection periods  changes in applicable regulatory policies  international monetary conditions  domestic and foreign tax policies  trade restrictions  duties and tariffs  and economic and political instability 
each of these factors could have a significant impact on the company s ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis 
patents and proprietary rights 
the company s success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon its proprietary information 
the company relies on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company files patent applications to protect technology  inventions and improvements that are significant to the development of its business 
the company has been issued six united states patents on the technologies related to its products and processes 
the company has applied for two additional patents related to its solid state laser products 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s patent applications will issue as patents  that any patents now or hereafter held by the company will offer any degree of protection  or that the company s patents or patent applications will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s competitors  many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  will not seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with the company s ability to make  use or sell its products either in the united states or in international markets 
in addition to patents  the company relies on trade secrets and proprietary know how which it seeks to protect  in part  through proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
the company s proprietary information agreements with its employees and consultants contain industry standard provisions requiring such individuals to assign to the company without additional consideration any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by the company  subject to customary exceptions 
there can be no assurance that proprietary information agreements with employees  consultant and others will not be breached  that the company would have adequate remedies for any breach  or that the company s trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors 
the laser and medical device industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights and companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
numerous patents are held by others  including academic institutions and competitors of the company 
because patent applications are maintained in secrecy in the united states until patents are issued and are maintained in secrecy for a period of time outside the united states  the company has not conducted any searches to determine whether the company s technology infringes any patents or patent applications 
the company has from time to time been notified of  or has otherwise been made aware of claims that it may be infringing upon patents or other proprietary intellectual property owned by others 
if it appears necessary or desirable  the company may seek licenses under such patents or proprietary intellectual property 
although patent holders commonly offer such licenses  no assurance can be given that licenses under such patents or intellectual property will be offered or that the terms of any offered licenses will be reasonable or will not adversely impact the company s operating results 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause shipment delays or require the company to develop non infringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent the company from manufacturing and selling its products  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
conversely  litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by the company or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
both the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits or interference proceedings are costly and time consuming 
government regulation 
the medical devices marketed and manufactured by the company are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and  in some instances  by foreign and state governments 
pursuant to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act of  as amended  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  the fda regulates the clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
before a new device can be introduced into the market  the manufacturer must obtain market clearance through either the k premarket notification process or the lengthier premarket approval pma application process 
obtaining these approvals can take a long time and delay the introduction of a product 
for example  the introduction of the oculight gl in the united states was delayed about three months from the company s expectations due to the longer than expected time period required to obtain fda premarket clearance 
noncompliance with applicable requirements  including good manufacturing practices gmp  can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by the company 
the failure of the company to obtain government approvals or any delays in receipt of such approvals would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
reimbursement 
the company s products are typically purchased by doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users  which bill various third party payors  such as governmental programs and private insurance plans  for the health care services provided to their patients 
third party payors carefully review and are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the procedure performed  the third party payor  the insurance plan and other factors 
medicare reimburses hospitals on a prospectively determined fixed amount for the costs associated with an in patient hospitalization based on the patient s discharge diagnosis  and reimburses physicians a prospectively determined fixed amount based on the procedure performed  regardless of the actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in furnishing the care and unrelated to the specific devices used in that procedure 
third party payors are increasingly scrutinizing whether to cover new products and the level of reimbursement for covered products 
while the company believes that the laser procedures using its products have generally been reimbursed  payors may deny coverage and reimbursement for the company s products if they determine that the device was not reasonable and necessary for the purpose for which used  was investigational or not cost effective 
additionally  there can be no assurance that pdt will be able to obtain coverage for its use of drugs with the company s oculight systems  or that the reimbursement will be adequate to cover the treatment procedure 
failure by doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain adequate reimbursement for use of the company s products from third party payors  and or changes in government legislation or regulation or in private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  the company is unable to predict what legislation or regulation  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future  or what effect such legislation or regulation may have on the company 
product liability and insurance 
the company may be subject to product liability claims in the future 
the company s products are highly complex  used to treat extremely delicate eye tissue and are often used in situations where there is a high risk of serious injury or adverse side effects 
in addition  although the company recommends that its disposable products only be used once and so prominently labels these disposables  the company believes that certain customers may reuse these disposables 
were such a disposable not adequately sterilized by the customer between such uses  a patient could suffer serious consequences  possibly resulting in a suit against the company for damages 
accordingly  the manufacture and sale of medical products entails significant risk of product liability claims 
although the company maintains product liability insurance with coverage limits of million per occurrence and an annual aggregate maximum of million  there can be no assurance that the coverage of the company s insurance policies will be adequate
