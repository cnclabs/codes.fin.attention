sales of general display terminals for are not expected to reach the levels for a number of reasons 
the digital acquisition agreement required digital to purchase  units in the first year 
as a result  the company believes that the significant purchases by digital during the fourth quarter to meet this volume commitment leaves digital with inventory levels sufficient to meet its terminal needs for the first half of the vt and dorio terminals are based on a proprietary architecture and  as a result  its users requiring flexibility are prone to more quickly move to alternative platforms 
finally  demand for the general display terminals continues to decline as competing technologies  including network computers  are gaining market share 
in response to this trend  that began several years ago  of industry wide declines in unit sales of general display terminals and  until  average selling prices per unit  the company has been increasing its general display terminals market share and either maintaining or increasing its general display terminal margins by purchasing the digital assets and by promoting the quality of its terminals and the flexibility of its just in time manufacturing capabilities 
the company has also positioned its multiconsole product as a low cost alternative to serial character terminals in multi user  microcomputer and personal computer environments emphasizing transaction oriented processing 
the company is developing a line of network computers which offer easy and cost effective access to current unix based and emerging nt based computing environments 
the company s strategy in increasing its share of a market where the product and market are mature is based upon its belief that there will be a continuing substantial demand for general display terminals  in part because of enhanced performance  and additional features  including ms windows nt and internet support  that allow general display terminals to compete favorably  in terms of price and performance  with low cost personal computers

in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded inventory reserves and write offs of approximately  representing an estimate of excess material on hand as of the end of the year  and wrote off approximately  of previously capitalized research and development cost as a result of the cancellation of certain programs

gross margin in future periods may be affected by several factors such as sales volume  shifts in product mix  pricing strategies and absorption of manufacturing costs 
in a continuing effort to maintain and improve margins in an industry otherwise characterized by commodity pricing  management has focused on quality  flexibility  and product cost reductions 
in addition  sales of the company s network computers  which carry margins greater than its general display terminals  are expected to positively impact the company s gross margin 
however  there can be no assurance  given the recent introduction of this new technology  that the company s network computers will improve gross margin 
from time to time margins are adversely affected by industry shortages of key components
