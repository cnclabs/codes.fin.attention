both acquisitions were completed through the exchange of stock  and were accounted for as purchases  accordingly  the acquired assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
ibc was merged into the company 
oxis sa operates as a subsidiary of the company 
in july  in a transaction which was also accounted for as a purchase  the company acquired therox pharmaceuticals  inc therox through an exchange of stock 
therox was merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the acquisition of therox provided the company with a technology portfolio complementary to its novel therapeutics for treatment of free radical associated diseases together with university relationships and seven patents 
because the acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases  the company s consolidated results of operations include the operating results of the acquired businesses from the dates of acquisition only 
therefore  the results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated statements of operations from september   and the results of therox s operations are included in the consolidated statements of operations from july  costs relating to the acquisitions and the company s more complex corporate structure and the increased research and development investments have placed significant demand on the company s limited financial resources 
see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources below 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources during the company s working capital deficit decreased slightly from  at december   to  at december  this decrease in the company s working capital deficit resulted primarily from the effect of the net loss for  less non cash charges of  offset by proceeds from issuance of stock  and convertible term notes 
cash and cash equivalents declined from  at december   to  at december  the company expects to continue to report losses in as the level of expenses is expected to continue to exceed revenues 
the company can give no assurances as to when and if its revenues will exceed its expenses 
the company must raise additional capital during the first half of failure to raise such additional capital would cause the company to severely curtail or cease operations 
for more information concerning the company s ability to continue as a going concern  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
while the company believes that its new products and technologies show considerable promise  its ability to realize significant revenues therefrom is dependent upon the company s success in developing business alliances with biotechnology and or pharmaceutical companies that have the required resources to develop and market certain of these products 
there is no assurance that the company s effort to develop such business alliances will be successful 
although the company is currently seeking additional capital described below  it cannot predict the source  terms  amount  form  and or availability of additional capital to fund its operations to the end of the current year 
during  the company raised approximately  cash through the sale of its series c  series d and series e preferred stock and common stock  and convertible term notes 
substantial additional capital will be required during to continue operating in accordance with its current plans 
the company has engaged an agent to assist on a best efforts basis to complete a private placement of its common stock 
in addition  the company has engaged a french investment banker to act as its underwriter for a planned public offering of its common stock on the newly opened french stock market  le nouveau marche  subject to obtaining appropriate authorization from the french stock market regulatory authorities 
however  no assurances can be given that the company will successfully raise the needed capital 
if the company is unable to raise additional capital during the first half of  it would endeavor to extend its ability to continue in business through the reduction of personnel and facility costs  by slowing its research and development efforts  and by reducing other operating costs  however  no assurances can be given that it will be able to do so 
results of operations revenues the company s sales for the past three years consisted of the following diagnostic and research assays    bovine superoxide dismutase bsod for research and human use    palosein r bsod for veterinary use    other    total sales    diagnostic and research assays are products acquired with the acquisitions of ibc and oxis sa sales of these products for represent sales from september through the end of the year 
the entire years sales of diagnostic and research assays are included in the company s sales for and bulk bsod sales in and included sales to sanofi winthrop  inc sales of bulk bsod to sanofi winthrop ceased in  when sanofi winthrop announced that the clinical trial in which it was using the company s bsod failed to show the desired results 
the decline in sales to sanofi winthrop has been offset to a large extent by increases in sales of bsod to tedec meiji farma sa  the company s spanish licensee 
future sales of bulk bsod are largely dependent on the needs of the company s spanish licensee 
the company expects its orders for from the spanish licensee to be less than those for the company s sales of bulk bsod beyond are uncertain and difficult to predict and no assurances can be given with respect thereto 
sales of palosein r  which was reintroduced to the us market in and is sold primarily to veterinary wholesalers in the united states  increased from  in to  in as a result of an active direct mail marketing campaign  but declined to  in due in part to large stocking orders by distributors in late the decrease in other sales was principally the result of the completion of an assay development contract in early royalties and license fees are not expected to be material in costs and expenses cost of sales as a percent of product sales declined from in to in in the cost of the company s diagnostic and research assays declined slightly as a result of increased volumes  and the cost of bulk bsod sales also declined from the level 
in cost of sales increased to of product sales 
the increase was primarily caused by a decline in the gross margin on bulk bsod sales 
the company s cost of sales includes amortization of technology acquired in  in  and  in and 
research and development costs increased from  in to  in  and  in the increase in was primarily due to the cost of the research and development activities associated with pharmaceutical technologies acquired in the september and july business acquisitions

in  sales  general and administrative expenses decreased by  to  most of the decrease was a decrease in the selling  general and administrative expenses of the company s french subsidiary 
in the third quarter of all of the company s manufacturing operations were consolidated in the united states and the french subsidiary became a research facility 
in connection with this restructuring  two administrative positions have been eliminated and certain other costs which were previously charged to administrative expenses are now being classified as research and development costs 
the administrative costs of the company s french subsidiary decreased  in as compared to expenses included charges of  and  to operations for and  respectively  reflecting the write off of purchased in process technology  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income and expense interest income decreased and interest expense increased in as the company liquidated certificates of deposit and borrowed funds pursuant to short term and long term interest bearing obligations to finance increased research and development efforts

per share charge to operations for the write off of purchased in process technology related to the acquisitions of oxis sa and ibc 
similarly  the loss includes a

per share for increased research and development expenditures and selling  general and administrative expenses from the businesses acquired late in the third quarter of and increased research and development expenditures relating to the acquisition of therox early in the third quarter of contributed to the increased losses in as compared to the increased loss for as compared to excluding the unusual charge is attributable primarily to the increased research and development costs relating to the company s glutathione peroxidase mimics program 
the company expects to incur a substantial net loss for if substantial additional capital is raised through further sales of securities see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources  the company plans to continue to invest in research and development activities and incur sales  general and administrative expenses in amounts greater than its anticipated near term product margins 
if the company is unable to raise sufficient additional capital  it will have to cease  or severely curtail  its operations 
in this event  while expenses will be reduced  expense levels  and the potential write down of various assets  would still be in amounts greater than anticipated revenues
