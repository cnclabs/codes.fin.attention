item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company was founded in and operated only in the phoenix  arizona area until in it expanded to tucson  arizona  in to southern california and in to texas 
from inception through  the company exclusively engaged in the refabrication of ocean going cargo containers  which it leased to the public for storage containers and portable offices 
in  the company began to sell containers 
contributing to growth of sales revenues was the development of a national distribution system referred to by the company as the national dealer network  manufacture of new company designed containers from raw steel as an alternative and supplement to the refabrication of ocean going containers  the manufacture of modular steel buildings discontinued in  see item description of business business restructuring and special order products which the company sells and leases to schools  governmental entities and others  and the development of the telecommunication shelter division which commenced operations in mid year the leasing of containers stored on site at the company s locations similar to traditional mini storage warehouses as well as the leasing of containers stored off site is becoming a more significant portion of the company s business and is contributing to the company s growth 
since  the number of units at the company s leasing locations has increased by the following percentages as compared to the preceding year december  as the leasing operations are the most profitable of the company s operations  management plans to increase the level of these operations  especially at existing locations 
in addition  the company expects to open additional facilities on a controlled basis at locations which management believes can become profitable over a relatively short period of time 
uncertainties faced by the company include variances in start up costs for new storage locations  competition in new markets  and the opportunity cost of deploying sufficient containers in a new market to reach economic viability 
while the company has experience in entering new market areas and conducts preliminary market research to assure itself that viable markets exist  there can be no assurance of success when expanding into new markets 
however  unlike fixed mini storage facilities  the company does have the ability to relocate its portable storage containers to other markets to adjust for market demand 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage  as a percent of total revenue  of certain items in the consolidated financial statements of the company  included elsewhere herein 
the table and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

excluding the effect of sale leaseback transactions  cost of container and modular building sales as a percentage of container and modular building sales increased to compared to for the prior year 
this increase is attributable to the mix of products sold  a shortage in supply of used containers  which caused an increase in the acquisition cost of these containers  in addition to an increase in sales of manufactured new containers which typically result in lower margins to the company  and a refinement in the company s allocation of certain indirect manufacturing costs 
excluding the effect of sale leaseback transactions  leasing  selling and general expenses were of total revenue in  compared to in the decrease primarily results from the continued efficiencies obtained by the company s texas operations  which were in their start up phase during  and to the company passing certain property tax expenses on to customers

the company also incurred financing costs of  in connection with the credit agreement  which have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the credit agreement

additional revenues  primarily related to delivery operations  increased from levels 
cost of sales increased to of sales and leasing revenues from of sales and leasing revenues in the increase was primarily attributable to the modular division which contracted for the construction of more sophisticated units requiring substantially more interior build out than in previous years and the start up of the new telecommunication shelter division  which generated lower profit margins during the start up phase 
leasing  selling and general expenses were of total revenues in  which approximated their level of of total revenues 
the company s new branch locations incurred higher administrative and advertising costs than in  which were offset by the increased revenues from the existing locations where a large portion of the leasing  selling and general expenses are fixed or semi variable

net income loss quarterly results can be affected by a number of factors  including the timing of orders  customer delivery requirements  production delays  inefficiencies  the mix of product sales and leases  raw material availability and general economic conditions 
seasonality there is little seasonality inherent in the company s operations 
however  sales of custom built units can be dependent on the purchasers timing needs to place the units into service 
in addition  demand for off site container leases is stronger from september through december due to increased needs for storing inventory for the holiday season by the company s retail customers 
containers used by these customers are often returned early in the following year  causing a lower than normal occupancy rate for the company during the first quarter 
the occupancy levels have historically ranged from a low of to a high of 
these seasonable fluctuations created a marginal decrease in cash flow for each of the first quarters during the past several years 
on site storage is not as subject to seasonal fluctuation  and the company anticipates that as on site storage becomes a larger percentage of its storage operations  that the company will experience less seasonability 
liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of its business  the company required increased amounts of financing to support the growth of its business during the last several years 
this financing has been required primarily to fund the acquisition and manufacture of containers for the company s lease fleet and also to fund the acquisition of property  plant and equipment and to support both the company s container leasing and manufacturing operations 
in order to improve its cash flow  increase its borrowing availability and fund its continued growth  in march the company entered into the credit agreement with bt commercial corporation  as agent for a group of lenders the lenders 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the lenders provided the company with a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
borrowings under the term loan are to be repaid over a five year period 
interest accrues on the term loan at the company s option at either prime plus or the eurodollar rate plus 
borrowings under the term loan are payable monthly as follows plus interest months through  months through  months through  additional principal payments equal to of excess cash flow  as defined in the term loan documents  are required annually 
available borrowings under the revolving line of credit are based upon the level of the company s inventories  receivables and container lease fleet 
the container lease fleet will be appraised at least annually  and up to of the lesser of cost or appraised orderly liquidation value may be included in the borrowing base 
interest accrues at the company s option at either prime plus or the eurodollar rate plus and is payable monthly or at the end of the term of any eurodollar borrowing period 
the term of this line of credit is three years  with a one year extension option 
as of december   million of borrowings were outstanding and approximately million of additional borrowing was available under the revolving line of credit 
the credit agreement contains several financial covenants including a minimum tangible net worth requirement  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum ratio of debt to equity  minimum operating income levels and minimum required utilization rates 
in addition  the credit agreement contains limits on capital expenditures  acquisitions  changes in control  the incurrence of additional debt  and the repurchase of common stock  and prohibits the payment of dividends 
in connection with the closing of the credit agreement in march  the company terminated its line of credit with its previous lender  repaying all indebtedness under that line 
in addition  the company repaid other long term debt and obligations under capital leases totaling million 
during  the company s operations provided cash flow of  compared to utilizing  in the improvement in cash flow primarily resulted from the improved financing terms under the credit agreement which permitted a reduction of accounts payables  partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities and an increase in receivables 
during  the company invested  in equipment and the container lease fleet 
this amount is net of  in related sales and financing 
cash flow from financing activities totaled  during this was the result of increased borrowings to finance container lease fleet and equipment acquisitions and the restructuring of the company s debt under the credit agreement  partially offset by the principal payments on indebtedness and an increase in other assets associated with deferred financing costs incurred in connection with the closing of the credit agreement 
the company believes that its current capitalization  together with borrowings available under the credit agreement  is sufficient to maintain its current level of operations and permit controlled growth and increased profitability for the next months 
however  should demand for the company s products exceed current expectation or should the cost of used containers continue to increase  the company would be required to secure additional financing through debt or equity offerings  additional borrowings or a combination of these sources 
however  there is no assurance that any such financings will be obtained or obtained on terms acceptable to the company 
certain factors affecting forward looking statements safe harbor statement this report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  the actual results of the company could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed elsewhere in this report  as well as the following uncertainty in supply and price of used containers the company s ability to obtain used containers for its lease fleet is subject in large part to the availability of these containers in the market 
this is in part subject to international trade issues and the demand for containers in the ocean cargo shipping business 
should there be a shortage in supply of used containers  the company could supplement its lease fleet with new manufactured containers 
however  should there be an overabundance of these used containers available  it is likely that prices would fall 
this could result in a reduction in the lease rates the company could obtain from its container leasing operations 
it could also cause the appraised orderly liquidation value of the containers in the lease fleet to decline 
in such event  the company s ability to finance its business through the credit agreement would be severely limited  as the maximum borrowing limit under that facility is based upon the appraised orderly liquidation value of the company s container lease fleet 
uncertainty of additional financing the company believes that its current capitalization  together with borrowings available under the credit agreement  is sufficient to maintain its current level of operations and permit controlled growth and increased profitability 
however  should demand for the company s products exceed current expectation  or should the cost of used containers continue to increase  the company would be required to secure additional financing through debt or equity offerings  additional borrowings or a combination of these sources 
however  there is no assurance that any such financings will be obtained or obtained on terms acceptable to the company 
lease utilization levels historically  the company has maintained lease fleet utilization levels in the to range 
during  the company s lease fleet utilization level was 
should the company experience an unexpected decline in demand for its lease units due to economic conditions  an increase in competition  an increase in supply of used containers or any other reason  the company would expect to dispose of containers in order to maintain acceptable utilization levels 
if this were to occur at a time when the market price of used containers has declined  it could result in losses on the sale of these containers 
in addition  the company s operating results would be adversely affected because it would continue to be subject to the high fixed costs of its branch operations but it would have reduced lease revenues 
uncertainty of future financial performance  fluctuations in operating results the company s results of operations may vary from period to period due to a variety of factors  including expenditures to acquire or start up and integrate into the company s operations new businesses which the company seeks to acquire as part of its expansion strategy  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  availability of and cost increases of used containers from which the company builds its container fleet  changes in marketing and sales expenditures  pricing pressures  market acceptance of the company s products  particularly in new market areas in which the company may expand  and general economic and industry conditions affect demand for the company s products and influence the company s operating costs and margins 
risk of debt covenant default the company has a million credit facility that expires in march the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the company is required to comply with certain covenants and restrictions  including covenants relating to the company s financial condition and results of operations 
if the company is unable or fails to comply with the covenants and restrictions  the lender would have the right not to make loans under the credit agreement and to require early payment of outstanding loans 
the lack of availability of loans or the requirement to make early repayment of loans would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
see liquidity and capital resources 
competition the company believes that its products  services  pricing and manufacturing capabilities allow it to compete favorably in each of the on site leasing  off site leasing and sales segments of the company s markets in the areas it currently operates 
however  the company s ability to continue to compete favorably in each of its markets is dependent upon many factors  including the market for used ocean going shipping containers and the costs of steel 
during  the price of used steel cargo containers increased by approximately 
the company believes that competition in each of its markets may increase significantly in the future 
it is probable that such competitors will have greater marketing and financial resources than the company 
as competition increases  significant pricing pressure and reduced profit margins may result 
prolonged price competition  along with outer forms of competition  could have a material adverse affect on the company s business and results of operations
