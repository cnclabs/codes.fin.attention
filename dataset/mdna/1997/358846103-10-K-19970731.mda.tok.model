these obligations  which greatly exceed reported revenues  are recorded as amounts due from customers and trade accounts payable 
currency and other risk factors the nature of the company s worldwide operations involves different currencies 
thus  the company is exposed to the inherent risks of international currency markets and governmental intervention 
the company seeks to compensate for currency exposures by accelerating international payment among the company s offices and agents 
in addition  the company s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities such as airlines  steamship carriers and governmental agencies 
accordingly  changes in space allotments available from carriers  governmental deregulation efforts  modernization of the regulations governing customs clearance  and or changes in the international trade and tariff environment could affect the company s business in unpredictable ways 
there are also risks and uncertainties associated with acquisitions  such as the complexities of integrating systems and operations of the acquired company 
management believes the company s business has not been adversely affected by inflation and has generally been successful in passing cost increases to its customers 
however  pressures exerted from the competitive marketplace could require future cost increases which could erode the company s margin 
additional risks and uncertainties include i the company s ability to implement its program to improve operating results and cash flow  ii dependence of the company on growth in international trade and worldwide economic conditions  iii dependence of the company on the continued services of key executives and managers  iv risks associated with the company s acquisition strategy  including a diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of acquired companies  b potential adverse short term effects of acquisitions on the company s operating results  and c integration of financial reporting systems and acquired assets

the risks and uncertainties described above could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward looking statements contained in this form k 
the description of risks and uncertainties is intended to qualify such forward looking statements and invoke the safe harbor provided by the private securities reform litigation act of the company is undertaking a comprehensive review of its pricing structure of its various services and customer credit terms
