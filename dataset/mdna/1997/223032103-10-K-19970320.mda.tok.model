except as the context otherwise requires  references to the company refer to the company  the bank  and the bank s subsidiary  first insurance agency  inc the discussion and analysis that follows should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  notes  and tables presented herein 
the information provided below has been rounded in order to simplify presentation 
however  ratios and percentages are calculated using the detailed financial information 
business strategy the key components of management s business strategy are as follows balance sheet structure and interest rate risk management management of the company has undertaken a restructuring of the balance sheet of the bank from a traditional thrift to that of a full service community bank 
as part of this effort  in december  management securitized with fhlmc  the conforming portfolio of and year fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans totaling approximately million 
at that time  the bank had of its balance sheet in fixed rate assets 
it is management s goal to have no more than of total assets in fixed rate instruments 
in  the company sold over million in and year fixed rate mortgage backed securities  generating net gains of over million  or approximately million after related taxes 
in december  the bank securitized another million in fixed rate and balloon mortgages with fhlmc  and may sell them in to meet liquidity needs 
because of the securitizations of loans in and  at december  there were million of loans remaining in the portfolio which were conforming and could be securitized 
in  unless there is a significant change in circumstances  additional material securitizations are not expected to occur 
redeploying the funds from these sales into variable rate investments and higher yielding commercial and commercial real estate loans enables the bank to remain flexible in volatile interest rate markets 
control of operating expense management continues to focus on controlling non interest expenses by implementing cost controls on all aspects of the bank s operations 
during  operating expenses prior to the one time saif assessment was  for  operating expenses net of two non recurring items discussed below in comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  non interest expense  was  this represents an increase of  or from most of this increase can be attributed to the operation of the schaumburg location  opened in march of it is management s intent to continue to closely monitor non interest expenses 
deposit base the company attracts both short term and long term deposits from the company s primary market area by offering a wide assortment of accounts and rates 
the company offers regular passbook and statement savings accounts  checking accounts both interest bearing and non interest bearing  money market accounts  fixed interest rate certificates of deposits with varying maturities  and individual retirement accounts 
deposit account terms vary  according to the minimum balance required  the time period the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate  among other factors 
in march of  the company offered for one day  a certificate of deposit promotion in conjunction with the grand opening of its new schaumburg location 
approximately million was deposited  at a rate of 
these certificates matured in september of  and concurrently  the company offered a new preferred money market product 
the product has been successful  with a rate that is competitive  but lower than  which helped the company s net interest margin to improve during the last quarter of in setting rates  the company regularly evaluates i its investment and lending opportunities  ii its internal costs of funds  iii the rates offered by competing institutions and iv its liquidity position 
in order to decrease the volatility of its deposits  the company imposes penalties on early withdrawal on its certificates of deposit 
the company does not have any brokered deposits and has no present intention to accept or solicit such deposits 
the company believes that non certificate accounts can provide relatively low cost funds and accordingly  the company introduces promotions to attract new checking accounts  and has begun offering new services to make these accounts more desirable such as telephone access banking and debit card  both of which have been extensively utilized by customers 
lending products the principal lending activity of the bank historically has been originating first mortgage loans for its portfolio  secured by owner occupied one to four family residential properties located in its primary market area 
the bank also offers a wide selection of consumer loans 
beginning late in  and continuing into  the bank began a major balance sheet restructuring project  to enable it to evolve into a full service commercial bank 
the bank now offers multi family structure loans  commercial loans  commercial real estate loans and commercial leases  and intends to focus on this type of lending going forward 
at the end of  the bank securitized million of fixed rate and balloon portfolio loans with fhlmc 
these loans were classified as securities at december  management may sell these securities in  depending on liquidity needed to originate higher yielding consumer and commercial loans 
the company also invests in mortgage backed and related securities to supplement its lending activities and to assist in asset liability management 
financial condition total consolidated assets of the company decreased million  or from million at december  to million at december  this decrease can be attributed to the restructuring that occurred on both sides of the balance sheet 
fixed rate mortgage backed securities were sold and partially replaced by commercial loans and adjustable rate mortgages and mortgage backed securities 
on the liability side  borrowings decreased  as did longer term certificates of deposit 
also  the certificates of deposit opened as part of the grand opening of the schaumburg office matured 
the company has seen an increase in shorter term deposit products such as the preferred money market account  which carries a lower rate of interest 
loans originated during the year ended december  totaled million  of which were residential mortgages  and were commercial real estate loans  commercial loans  and commercial leases  and were consumer loans 
of the first mortgage loans originated  were fixed rate  and the balance were balloons and adjustables 
as part of the balance sheet restructuring project  management is focusing more on commercial lending 
the bank s mortgage loan originations are made up of mostly adjustable rate and balloon products which have shorter maturities  than and year fixed rate instruments 
the bank securitized million of fixed rate and balloon loans in december  resulting in net loans receivable increasing million  or from million at december   to million at december  the million of securitized loans were classified as mortgage backed securities available for sale at december  loans originated for the year ended december  totaled million  of which were mortgages  were consumer  and was a commercial real estate loan 
of the first mortgage loans originated in  were fixed rate  and the balance were balloons and adjustable 
total non performing loans as of december  increased to  or of total assets 
at december   non performing loans were  or of total assets 
historically this number is at the high end of the range  but below the rate experienced by the bank s peer group 
management believes the allowance for possible loan losses to be adequate 
furthermore  of non performing loans were one to four family residential mortgages  and the bank has not incurred any losses on such mortgages within the last five years 
mortgage backed and other mortgage related securities decreased million or from december  during  proceeds from the sales of fixed rate mortgage backed securities as well as principal payments and other securities maturities totaling million  were used to purchase million in predominantly adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
at december   million of newly securitized loans are held in the mortgage backed portfolio  as available for sale 
non mortgage backed securities increased million or from december  most of the securities purchased were us treasury and government agency obligations 
at december   mortgage backed and other securities comprised of total assets 
deposits decreased to million at december   from million at december   a decrease of million or 
this decrease was a direct result of million in maturing certificates of deposit  partially offset by increases in a new preferred money market product  and growth in both non interest bearing checking accounts and short term certificates of deposit 
short term borrowings due within one year decreased million from the december  balance of million to million at december  long term borrowings  all of which are federal home loan bank advances  have also decreased million  or since year end book value per common share decreased to at december  from at december  this was due to the one time saif special assessment  and the change in the unrealized gain on securities available for sale  from a gain of million at december   to a gain of 
million at december  earnings per share increased from 
for the year ended december   to for the year ended december   without the effect of the one time saif special assessment 
results of operations the bank s results of operations depend primarily on the level of its net interest income and its ability to generate non interest income and control non interest expense 
net interest income is a function of the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rates paid on them 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general net income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease included the one time special assessment to recapitalize the saif  in the amount of  pre tax 
this non recurring charge was offset by net gains on the sales of securities of approximately million  or million  after related taxes 
during  two non recurring items were recorded 
they were  for the estimated unfunded liability of the defined benefit plan  and  for compensation to former officers  less related taxes 
without the effect of these non recurring items  net income for would have been  compared to  for  an increase of  or 
this increase can be attributed to gains on sales of securities and increases in other non interest income of  offset by a decrease in net interest income of  an increase in the provision for possible loan losses of  an increase in non interest expense of  and an increase in taxes of  prior to the tax effect on the non recurring items 
interest income interest income increased by  or to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december   even though the yield on average earning assets decreased basis points to for  as compared to a yield for see the volume rate analysis section  below 
contributing to the decrease in yield was the restructuring of the balance sheet  which resulted in a greater amount of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities as compared to last year 
management has begun to convert these securities to higher yielding loans 
the bank started operating a new commercial lending department  and it is expected that these types of loans will become an increasing portion of the total loan portfolio 
the following table illustrates the increase in yield on average earning assets the company has experienced for each quarter of due mainly to the balance sheet restructuring for the indicated quarter of st nd rd th yield on average earning assets interest expense interest expense increased by  or to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase can be attributed primarily to an increase in the average amount of borrowed money  from  for  to  for the cost of total interest bearing liabilities remained constant  at for and see the volume rate analysis section 
below 
the following table illustrates the decrease in costs of average interest bearing liabilities the company has experienced for each quarter of during september  the maturity of million in certificates of deposit took place 
for the indicated quarter of st nd rd th cost of average interest bearing liabilities provision for possible loan losses the provision for possible loan losses totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  of this  or increase   was related to new commercial real estate loans  for which the company establishes a provision for possible losses at the time the loans are recorded 
the balance of this increase resulted from a decision by management to increase the loan loss allowance in light of recent higher write off experience on credit cards 
the bank  and the banking industry as a whole  is beginning to see more credit card charge offs resulting from personal bankruptcies 
for the year ended december   of all of the charge offs experienced by the company were related to personal bankruptcies 
management regularly conducts a review of its loan portfolio  write off experience and adequacy of allowance 
during  management intends to provide the greater of  or charge offs on a monthly basis  to maintain the allowance at a level management feels is adequate 
net interest income after provision for possible loan losses net interest income after provision for possible loan losses decreased by  or to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the average net interest rate spread for was compared to for the following table illustrates the increases in interest spread and net interest margin the company has experienced for each quarter of  due to the balance sheet restructuring  including the maturity of the certificates of deposit for the indicated quarter of st nd rd th net interest spread net interest margin non interest income non interest income increased by  or to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december   prior to net gains on the sale of securities in of  the year ended december  produced a net loss on the sale of securities of  most of the balance of the increase in non interest income was attributable to recognition of loan servicing fees  which increased  or 
deposit related fees and charges also increased  or  as there has been a general increase in fees charged for various bank services since last year 
non interest expense non interest expense was  for  compared to  for  an increase of  or 
in  there were two non recurring items recorded 
they were  for the estimated unfunded liability of the defined benefit plan  and  for compensation to former officers  less related taxes 
during  a non recurring expense was recorded for  representing the final unfunded liability as a result of the termination of the defined benefit plan 
the final determination was higher than anticipated due to a decrease in interest rates between the termination announcement date of january   and the date the final distribution was made on may  also recorded in  was  for the one time assessment to recapitalize the saif insurance fund  at basis points 
without giving consideration to these items  non interest expense increased  or  from  for  to  for most of this increase can be attributed to the operation of the schaumburg location  opened in march of income tax expense income tax expense decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   due to the decrease in income as a result of the saif special assessment 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general net income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
there were two non recurring items that were recorded in additional pension expense of  was recorded to reflect the curtailment of the bank s defined benefit plan  and  in additional compensation expense was incurred due to payouts made to two former officers of the bank 
the balance of the decrease in net income was due primarily to a decrease in net interest income after provision for possible loan losses of  and an increase in non interest expenses of  offset by an increase in non interest income of  and a decrease in income taxes of  interest income interest income for the year ended december  increased by  or to  as compared to  for the yield on earning assets increased basis points to for  as compared to a yield for  due to higher average balances in of mortgage loans and mortgage backed and related securities 
of the million increase  million can be attributed to higher volume  and million can be attributed to rate

interest expense on borrowed funds was  for with an average cost of for the year 
for  interest expense on borrowed money was  with an average cost of for the year 
provision for possible loan losses the provision for possible loan losses totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase resulted from a decision by management to increase the possible loan loss allowances in light of higher write off experiences in the bank s credit card portfolio  as well as a general rise in charge offs industry wide 
management regularly conducts a review of its loan portfolios and write off experiences  and believes the reserves are adequate at this time 
in addition   of the increase is related to the higher outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans 
net interest income after provision for possible loan losses net interest income after provision for possible loan losses declined by  or to  for compared to  for  as the average net interest rate spread also declined from at december  to at december  this narrowing of the spread is a direct result of the aforementioned certificate of deposit promotion 
these certificate accounts carried a rate of and matured in september of in addition  the yield curve flattened  from a slope of at december  to a slope of at december  the slope is the difference between rates paid on year treasury notes and month treasury bills 
the smaller the slope  the flatter the yield curve 
non interest income non interest income increased by  or to  for from  for the increase of  in service charges on deposit accounts was the result of actively pursuing fees for services the bank did not charge for in the past

management has an asset liability committee  consisting of senior officers  which meets monthly to review the bank s interest rate risk position and make recommendations for adjusting such position 
in addition  the board reviews the bank s position on a monthly basis  including simulations of the effect on the bank s capital of various interest rate scenarios 
in managing its asset liability mix  the bank may place greater or less emphasis on maximizing net interest margin than on better matching the interest rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities in an effort to improve its capital  depending on the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions  and consumer preferences 
management believes that the increased net income resulting from a mismatch in the maturity of its assets and liability portfolios can  during periods of declining or stable interest rates  provide high enough returns to justify the increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates which can result from such a mismatch 
as a result  the bank may be somewhat more exposed to rapid increases in interest rates than some other institutions which concentrate principally on matching the duration of their assets and liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage backed securities  and funds provided by other operations 
while scheduled loan and mortgage backed securities repayments and maturities of short term investments are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  competition and the restructuring occurring in the banking industry 
the company s cash flows are a result of three principal activities operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
net cash received in operating activities  primarily interest on loans and investments  less interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds  was 
million for the year ended december  net cash received in investing activities was million for the year ended december  security sales and maturities generated million while principal payments on mortgage backed and related securities amounted to million 
purchases of investment securities and mortgage backed securities were million  and loan originations  net of principal payments  were million for the year 
net cash used in financing activities amounted to million for the year ended december   and was accounted for mostly by the net decrease in short term borrowings and deposits 
the company uses its liquidity to meet its ongoing commitments to fund maturing certificates of deposit and deposit withdrawals  repay borrowings  fund existing and continuing loan commitments  and pay operating expenses 
at december   the company had commitments to originate loans totaling million  and its customers had approved but unused lines of credit totaling million 
the company considers its liquidity and capital resources to be adequate to meet its foreseeable short and long term needs 
the company expects to be able to fund or refinance  on a timely basis  its material commitments and long term liabilities 
capital resources at december   the bank had core and tangible capital of million or of adjusted total assets  which was approximately million and million above the minimum capital requirements in effect on that date of and  respectively  of adjusted total assets 
on december   the bank had total risk based capital of million including million in core capital  or of risk weighted assets of million 
this amount was approximately million above the total risk based capital requirement in effect on that date

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
however  sfas no 
does not apply to financial instruments  core deposit intangibles  mortgage and other servicing rights  or deferred tax assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
in did not have a material effect of the bank s income or financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights 
sfas no  requires an institution that purchases or originates mortgage loans and sells or securitized those loans with servicing rights retained to allocate the total cost of the mortgage loans to the mortgage servicing rights and the loan without the mortgage servicing rights based on their relative fair values 
in addition  institutions are required to assess impairment of the capitalized mortgage servicing portfolio based on the fair value of those rights 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the bank s earnings or financial condition 
sfas no 
will be superseded by sfas no 
after december  in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement establishes financial accounting standards for stock based employee compensation plans 
sfas no 
permits the bank to choose either a new fair value based method or the current apb opinion intrinsic value based method of accounting for its stock based compensation agreements

under that approach  after the transfer of financial assets  an entity recognizes the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished 
sfas no 
also supersedes sfas no 
and requires that servicing assets and liabilities be subsequently measured by amortization in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income or loss and requires assessment for asset impairment or increases obligation based on their fair values 
sfas no 
applies to transfers and extinguishments occurring after december  and early or retroactive application is not permitted 
because the volume and variety of certain transactions will make it difficult for some entities to comply  some provisions have been delayed by sfas no 
management anticipates that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on the financial condition or operations of the bank 
in august  legislation was enacted requiring recapture of tax bad debt reserves accumulated after over a six year period starting in however  the payment of the tax can be deferred in each of and if an institution originated at least the same average annual principal amount of mortgage loans that it originated in the six year prior to the impact of this legislation will not have a material effect on the financial position or operations of the bank
