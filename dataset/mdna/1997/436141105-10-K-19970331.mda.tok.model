new hollywood video stores typically experience lower sales volume in the first year of operation than do mature stores 
because a portion of store level operating expenses is fixed  new stores generally have lower operating margins in their first year of operation 
in addition  pre opening expenses are charged to earnings in the first full month of a store s operation 
therefore  the addition of a significant number of new stores to the company s existing store base has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse impact on the company s operating margins

income taxes the company s effective tax rate for was  compared to in the increase in was due to a higher federal statutory rate and a higher aggregate state tax rate  partially offset by higher tax exempt interest income 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal capital requirements are for opening new stores  the purchase of rental inventory and the possible acquisition of existing stores 
the company has funded its operations primarily through cash from operations  the proceeds of five public offerings  loans under the company s revolving bank line of credit  trade credit and equipment leases 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and working capital of million 
videocassette rental inventories are accounted for as noncurrent assets under generally accepted accounting principles because they are not assets which are reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle 
although the rental of this inventory generates a substantial portion of the company s revenue  the classification of these assets as noncurrent excludes them from the computation of working capital 
the acquisition cost of videocassette rental inventories  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  included in the computation of working capital 
consequently  the company believes working capital is not as significant a measure of financial condition for companies in the video retail industry as it is for companies in other industries 
because of the accounting treatment of videocassette rental inventory as a noncurrent asset  the company may  from time to time  operate with a working capital deficit 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for the increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to higher net income from operations and higher depreciation and amortization expenses  partially offset by an increase in merchandise inventories 
cash used in investing activities was million for compared to million for for  cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of net purchases of videocassette rental inventory for new and existing stores totaling million and capital expenditures and related increase in landlord receivables totaling million 
capital expenditures included the costs to open new stores  remodel certain existing stores and enhance information systems

future capital requirements consist primarily of financing the addition of new retail stores and converting certain acquired stores to the hollywood video name and store design  together with the possible acquisition of existing stores 
the company anticipates opening at least new stores in each video store opening requires initial capital expenditures  including leasehold improvements  inventory  equipment and costs related to site location  lease negotiations  construction supervision and permits  of approximately  excluding leasehold improvements that are customarily paid for by the property developer 
at december   the company had a million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
in january the company replaced its existing revolving credit agreement with a new million revolving credit agreement 
under the new agreement funds borrowed bear interest  at the company s option  at ibor or the bank s base rate  plus approximately  depending on the amount of borrowings 
the company must also pay a fee of per annum on the available and unused portion of the credit facility 
amounts outstanding under the credit line are collateralized by substantially all the assets of the company 
the availability of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement is based on the level of eligible inventory  the company s financial performance and compliance with certain covenants and financial ratios 
the credit line expires on december  as of december   million was outstanding under the revolving credit agreement that was in place at that time 
of this amount  approximately million was borrowed to fund the share repurchase 
see note 
the company believes the net proceeds from its december public offering  its recently increased borrowing capacity  projected cash flow from operations  cash on hand and equipment leases and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to fund the opening of approximately new video retail superstores in general economic trends  quarterly results and seasonality the company anticipates that its business will be affected by general economic and other consumer trends 
future operating results may be affected by various factors  including variations in the number and timing of new store openings  the performance of new or acquired stores  the quality and number of new release titles available for rental and sale  the expense associated with the acquisition of new release titles  additional and existing competition  marketing programs  weather  special or unusual events and other factors that may affect retailers in general 
in addition  any concentration of new store openings and the related new store pre opening costs and other expenses associated with the opening of new stores near the end of a fiscal quarter could have an adverse effect on the financial results for that quarter and could  in certain circumstances  lead to fluctuations in quarterly financial results 
the video retail industry generally experiences relative revenue declines in april and may  due in part to the change in daylight savings time and due to improved weather  and in september and october  due in part to the start of school and the introduction of new television programs 
the company believes these seasonality trends will continue
