the distribution segment was the primary growth contributor to the company s sales with an increase in sales of million in fiscal compared to fiscal a strengthening oil and gas market served by the company s distribution territory contributed to these sales improvements  particularly among the company s detroit diesel  emd and waukesha product lines 
the tactical vehicle systems tvs segment sales increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in tvs sales reflects the increase in truck production under the family of medium tactical vehicles fmtv contract to  trucks in fiscal as compared to  trucks in fiscal the engineered power systems eps segment sales were the primary contributor to the company s sales decline  decreasing million in fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  the eps segment saw a continuation of the very weak domestic market for its gas turbine electrical power generation equipment  as well as a very competitive international market place 
incoming domestic orders  which declined significantly in fiscal  were non existent in fiscal the international market activity  although encouraging  did not produce a level of new orders adequate to offset the lost revenue and profits from the domestic market 
this decrease was partially offset by the gas turbine product support group consisting of the servicing of customer s equipment and the long term contracting for the operation and maintenance of the customer s power plants which increased sales million in fiscal as compared to fiscal airline and petroleum equipment experienced increased sales of million and million  respectively  in fiscal as compared to fiscal operating profit decreased approximately during fiscal to million as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in gross profit margin reflects both the decrease in turbine driven equipment sales as well as decrease in the gross profit margin on these gas turbine driven equipment sales 
fiscal vs 
fiscal sales for fiscal increased to billion compared to sales of billion for fiscal the company s international sales increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  representing and of consolidated sales for fiscal and  respectively 
the distribution segment was the primary contributor to the company s sales growth with an increase in sales of million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of power application mfg  co 
pamco  a waukesha distributor for the western united states  during the fourth quarter of fiscal the distribution of product lines acquired from pamco contributed sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding sales relating to the pamco acquisition  the distribution segment s sales increased in fiscal over fiscal reflecting the continued economic growth in the territories serviced by the company 
the tactical vehicle systems segment sales increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in tvs sales reflects the increase in truck production under the fmtv contract to  trucks in fiscal as compared to  trucks in fiscal although sales increased for the current fiscal year  the increase was less than anticipated 
sales for the year were adversely affected by the deployment of certain us army personnel to haiti in fiscal which delayed the completion of testing and certification of the fmtv program for high volume production until the fourth quarter of fiscal the engineered power systems segment of the company experienced a decrease in sales in fiscal this decline in eps sales was primarily within the gas turbine equipment product lines which experienced sharply reduced domestic activity  reflecting the us utility market s response to deregulation proposals  and delays in contract awards in the international markets 
gas turbine product support sales  consisting of the servicing of customers equipment and the long term contracting for operation and maintenance of power plants  continued to grow with fiscal sales increasing more than above fiscal operating profit decreased by approximately during fiscal to million as compared to million in fiscal both the distribution and the tactical vehicle systems segments operating profits increased at a rate comparable to the growth in sales volumes 
the engineered power systems segment s operating profit of in fiscal declined from in fiscal this decline is primarily related to lower profits realized on the sale of certain compression equipment during fiscal  and to increased market competitiveness 
net period expenses dollars in thousands percentage change fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal selling and administrative expenses    interest expense    settlement of litigation  n a n a other income  net    net period expenses as a percentage of sales net period expenses increased significantly during fiscal  both in amount and in relation to sales  when compared to fiscal selling and administrative expenses increased primarily in those business lines having sales growth  in addition a one time charge of approximately thousand related to settling a lawsuit and substantial legal expenses related to the peace shield litigation are also included 
interest expense grew significantly in both fiscal and reflecting the increased borrowings required to fund the company s operations  primarily gas turbine inventories relating to international contracts that do not contain substantial progress payments and inventories of vehicles under the fmtv 
the decrease in other income during fiscal is primarily attributable to both decreased interest income and decreased gains on the disposal of real estate 
on july   a jury in houston  texas returned a million verdict against the company in a case filed by serv tech  inc for breach of a secrecy agreement 
the company s liability in connection with this matter was limited pursuant to a pretrial agreement between the company and serv tech 
the company recognized a pre tax charge against earnings of million million or 
per share after taxes relating to this case in the second quarter of fiscal the judgment based on this verdict was paid by the company in september net earnings dollars in thousands percentage change fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal amount    percentage of sales fiscal s net earnings decline from fiscal primarily reflects the decrease in operational profits and the increase in net period expense 
income tax expense  relative to operational profits  was comparable for fiscal  and financial condition working capital percentage change fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands current assets   current liabilities   working capital   current ratio current assets increased million from fiscal this increase was primarily in accounts and notes receivable  which increased million and inventories which increased million 
the increase in accounts receivable reflects the significant increase in consolidated revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the same period a year ago 
the growth in inventories  at a rate faster than annual revenue growth  can be attributed to the engineered power systems procurement and manufacturing activities in anticipation of increased demand 
current liabilities decreased million from fiscal  with decreases primarily in notes payable of million and billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of incurred costs of million  offset by an increase in accounts payable of million 
the reduction in notes payable reflects the company strategy of replacing a portion of notes payable with long term debt 
the decrease in billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of incurred costs was caused by the customer payment terms on uncompleted contracts which were more favorable to the customer at the end of fiscal than at the end of fiscal investments the company s capital expenditures for plant  rental machines and other property were million for fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal the increase reflects the company s continuing investment in business units capable of rapid growth 
depreciation and amortization totaled million for fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal additionally  the company disposed of approximately million of property during fiscal versus disposals of million during fiscal investments and other assets were million at the end of fiscal  an increase of million from the end of fiscal this increase is primarily comprised of an investment in an independent power producer operating in argentina  as well as an increase in the non current portion of notes receivable 
company s capital dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal amount percentage amount percentage long term debt   other long term liabilities   shareholders equity   long term debt increased million during fiscal  reflecting the company s strategy to reduce its dependence on short term notes payable and to take advantage of relatively attractive long term interest rates 
shareholders equity increased million during fiscal primarily as a result of earnings retained after dividends 
liquidity the company s sources of liquidity include cash and equivalents  cash from operations  amounts available under credit facilities and other external sources of funds 
the company believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital  capital expenditures  dividends and other financial commitments

working capital to support the operations of the company fluctuates significantly depending on the progress payment streams of contracts in process 
the tactical vehicle systems segment is primarily funded by progress payments under government regulations which require that contractors retain a significant amount of the contract costs until government acceptance of the product 
the company regularly bids on commercial and government contracts  which if awarded to the company  could significantly affect both working capital and capital expenditures needs

the notes are unsecured and were issued pursuant to an agreement containing a covenant which imposes a debt to total capitalization requirement 
the notes will mature in three  five  seven and ten year increments with semi annual interest payments at a weighted average life and coupon rate of years and  respectively 
the proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to reduce other short term outstanding indebtedness of the company and for general corporate purposes 
in the event that any acquisition of additional operations  growth in existing operations  changes in inventory levels  accounts receivable or other working capital items create a need for working capital or capital expenditures in excess of existing committed lines of credit  the company may seek to convert uncommitted borrowing arrangements to committed credit facilities  to borrow under other long term financing sources or to issue additional equity securities 
the amount of cash dividends increased and during fiscal and  respectively 
cash dividends represented  and of net earnings before accounting change for fiscal  and  respectively 
the board of directors of the company intends to consider the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis  commensurate with the company s earnings and financial needs 
the company uses both funds from operations  along with borrowings  to pay dividends 
accounting developments in june  the financial accounting standard board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
this standard provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
this standard is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to impact the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
tactical vehicle systems contract status under the terms of the fmtv contract  approximately  vehicles produced before december were required to be retrofitted with any modifications required by test results or specification changes ordered by the us government 
this retrofit program was commenced during the fourth quarter of fiscal and was substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal full rate production of the fmtv commenced after the retrofit program was substantially completed and  as of january   the company has completed approximately  of the  vehicles covered by the original contract plus options and additional requirements to date 
during fiscal  the company entered into a contract modification that extended the fmtv delivery schedule through december and reduced the annual product requirements 
the total number of vehicles covered by the fmtv contract did not change 
major contracts for military systems are performed over extended periods of time and are subject to changes in scope of work and delivery schedules 
pricing negotiations on changes and settlement of claims often extend over prolonged periods of time 
the company s ultimate profitability on such contracts will depend not only upon the accuracy of the company s cost projections  but also the eventual outcome of an equitable settlement of contractual issues with the us government 
the fmtv contract is a firm fixed price multi year contract whereby the price paid to the company is not subject to adjustment to reflect the company s actual costs  except costs incurred as a result of actions or inactions of the government 
stewart stevenson has incurred significant cost overruns and delivery schedule delays on the fmtv contract which the company believes are primarily due to the government s decision to delay the testing of trucks and other government directed changes to the contract 
the company has and will continue to submit a series of requests for equitable adjustments reas  under the fmtv contract  seeking increases in the fmtv contract price for those additional costs that relate to government caused delays and changes 
revenues and profits realized on the fmtv contract are based on the company s estimates of total contract sales value and costs at completion 
amounts in excess of agreed upon contract price for government caused delays  disruptions  unpriced change orders and government caused additional contract costs are recognized in contract value when the company believes it is probable that the claim for such amounts will result in additional contract revenue and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
at january   the company s fmtv contract accounting position reflects the expected recovery of substantial amounts in excess of the contract price for government caused delays  disruptions  unpriced change orders and other government caused additional contract costs 
these claims are in varying stages of negotiation 
although management believes that the contract provides a legal basis for the claims and its estimates are based on reasonable assumptions and on a reasonable analysis of contract costs  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation and claims negotiations process  no assurances can be given that its estimates will be accurate  and variances between such estimates and actual results could be material 
in the event that the company is unable to recover a substantial portion of the additional costs  the company may suffer a material adverse effect on its earnings during the accounting period in which such contract issues are resolved 
the funding of the contract is subject to the inherent uncertainties of congressional appropriations 
as is typical of multi year defense contracts  the fmtv contracts must be funded annually by the department of the army and may be terminated at any time for the convenience of the government 
the company has received full funding for the production of approximately  vehicles through august it is anticipated that the remaining  vehicles will be funded after october when the government fiscal year funding is approved 
if the fmtv contract is terminated other than for default  the fmtv contract provides for termination charges that will reimburse the company for allowable costs  but not necessarily all costs 
effect of certain litigation on may   the company and four employees  including the company s president  were indicted by a federal grand jury on six counts arising out of a subcontract to supply diesel generator sets for installation in saudi arabia 
see note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
on may   the us air force suspended the company from contracting with any agency of the us government and from receiving the benefit of federal assistance programs 
this suspension was temporarily terminated on november   pending the resolution of the charges covered by the indictment  pursuant to an interim administrative agreement between the company and the us air force 
the interim administrative agreement does not have any effect on the indictment 
the interim administrative agreement requires the company to maintain various internal procedures and policies intended to assure the us government that the company is a responsible contractor 
in the event that the company or any of the indicted employees are convicted of the charges contained in the indictment  the us air force may re evaluate whether the company should be suspended or debarred based on all of the facts and circumstances then known 
an acquittal of all parties of the charges does not terminate the interim administrative agreement and any failure by the company to perform its obligations thereunder may also be grounds for suspension or debarment 
if the company is suspended or debarred  either because of a conviction pursuant to the indictment or as a result of a breach of the interim administrative agreement  it would be ineligible to enter into new contracts or subcontracts with agencies of the us government or receive the benefit of federal assistance payments for the duration of such suspension or debarment 
any such suspension could also prevent the company from receiving future modifications to the fmtv contract unless the secretary of the army finds a compelling need to enter into such modification 
the company would also be unable to sell equipment and services to customers that depend on loans or financial commitments from the export import bank exim bank  overseas private investment corporation opic and similar government agencies during a suspension or debarment 
the engineered power systems segment frequently sells equipment to customers that rely on financial commitments from exim bank and or opic 
any such suspension or debarment could have a material adverse impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations
