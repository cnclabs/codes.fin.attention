c ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization year ended december  versus year ended december  total ebitda for the year ended december  was million up million from s million 
the principal factors impacting ebitda in were a higher total revenues of million offset by million in net higher property operating costs and administrative costs  as further explained below 
year ended december  versus year ended december  ebitda grew from million in the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the two malls acquired in january contributed million in ebitda 
the remaining net decrease of million was due primarily to a higher property operating and marketing costs of approximately million  b million in higher property and general administrative costs as noted above  and c million lower miscellaneous income primarily fees and commiss ions  offset by d million higher operating revenues from the other malls  and e million higher gain on land sales 
d property operating results and trends aggregate tenant sales volume over the long term  the level of anchor and mall shop tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the company as anchor and mall shop tenants provide over of total revenues and because tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent and recoverable expenses to gether  total occupancy costs that tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of tenant sales are considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs 
in a period of rapidly increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of declining sales  rents on new leases tend to grow more slowly 
however  revenues generally increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
average base rents per square foot for mall shop tenants at quarter end for the last three years were as follows march june september december the increase in average base rent during these three years results primarily from renewing existing leases at higher base rents  from leasing vacant space at higher base rents  and from elimination of lower paying tenants that closed during this period 
total reported sales for all tenants that reported sales for the applicable years are shown below in millions anchors owned locations  mall shop tenants  excluding freestanding and theater the above data excludes sales from all seasonal and temporary tenants who generally do not report their sales to the company 
the company owns of anchor store locations in and in late the company sold three anchor stores to the may department stores company 
comparable mall store sales and occupancy cost management believes that over long periods of time the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits increases as sales per square foot in crease  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall shop tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs base fixed rents  percentage rents  and expense recoveries pro rata share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance and other costs pertaining to the property that they can afford to pay and still be profitable is a higher per centage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
while such increased occupancy costs as a percentage of sales cannot grow indefinitely for any one tenant  management believes that it is possible to increase the percentage paid by all tenants as a group by aggressively working to replace under performing tenants with better performing ones 
comparable mall store sales per square foot in each reporting period is based on sales reported by mall store tenants excludes anchors and certain other large space users that occupied space in both the current and immediately preceding reporting period 
comparable mall store sales per square foot for the last three years are set out below 
also shown below is the percentage of mall shop tenants occupancy costs as a percentage of their annual sales 
comparable mall store sales per square foot occupancy cost percentage at period end seasonality and occupancy the enclosed shopping mall industry is seasonal in nature  with anchor and mall shop tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school events 
while minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  many leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter 
the aggregate occupancy percentage  defined as the ratio of total mall shop space that is leased including both tenants occupying space and tenants that have signed leases but have not yet taken occupancy to the total mall shop space gross leasable area gla at quarter end for the last three years is set out below 
march june september december the decline in occupancy in occurred due to a higher than normal number of tenant bankruptcies and early closings  particularly in the first and second quarters of  and  to a lesser extent  from slower leasing activity

the company intends to pay regular quarterly dividends to its shareholders 
however  the company s ability to pay dividends is affected by several factors  including cash flow from operations  capital expenditures  and its ability to refinance its maturing debt as described in the third following paragraph 
dividends by the company will be at the discretion of the board of trustees and will depend on the cash available to the company  its financial condition  capital and other requirements  and such other factors as the trustees may consider 
during the board of trustees determined that the company should retain more of its internally gen erated cash flows to supplement other expected financing sources in order to make investments in certain mall expansion and renovations including the logan valley mall reconstruction and in various other investment opportunities 
accordingly  the company s quarterly dividend of 
per share was reduced to 
per share beginning with the dividend paid in september the annual amount of additional cash retained is approximately million 
sources of capital for non recurring capital expenditures  such as major building renovations and expansions  as well as for scheduled principal pay ments  including balloon payments on the outstanding indebtedness  are expected to be obtained from additional company or property financings and re financings  sale of non strategic assets  additional equity raised in the public or private markets  and from retained internally generated cash flows  or from combinations thereof 
on december  a fire occurred at the logan valley mall located in altoona  pennsylvania 
the fire destroyed small shops aggregating  square feet of gross leasable space and also affected three additional small shops containing approximately  square feet of gross leasable space 
the net book value of the destroyed assets approximated million 
the company settled the property damage insurance claim with its insurance company in the third quarter of for million 
the difference between the amount received and the net book value of destroyed assets and the related demolition and clean up costs is million  which has been recorded as an extraordinary gain in during the company also recorded million in business interruption insurance  which is included in other revenues 
the business interruption insurance coverage expired in may because of the business interruption insurance coverage  the fire had no material impact on  and results of operations 
during the company started the reconstruction and expansion of the fire damaged mall  the entire construc tion project is expected to be completed in late and to cost approximately million  including tenant allowances for new tenants  construction financing has been arranged with the expected total borrowings ranging from million to million  and with the remaining project costs funded from the company s internal cash flows 
as of december  the scheduled principal payments on all debt are as follows million  million  million  million  and million in the years ended december  through  respect ively  and million thereafter 
the company expects to refinance or extend the majority of the maturities over the next five years through add itional company financings and mortgage loans on those properties having the maturing loans 
the company s ability to refinance or extend these loans on or before their due dates depends on the level of income generated by the prop erties  prevailing interest rates  credit market trends  and other factors that may be in affect at the time of such refinancings or extensions and there is no assurance that such refinancings or extensions will be executed 
the ratios of the company s ebitda to cash interest costs for the years ended december    and were to  to  and to  respectively 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  crown investments and its subsidiary have been granted rights  subject to certain re strictions  whereby they may redeem part or all of their partnership units for shares  on a one to one basis  or cash at a price equal to the value of the company s common shares 
crown investments has pledged a portion of its limited partnership units as collateral for a loan it has received from an unrelated third party 
g economic trends because inflation has remained relatively low during the last three years it has had little impact on the operations of the company during this period 
tenant leases also provide  in part  a mechanism to help protect the company during highly inflationary periods 
as operating costs increase  leases permit a pass through of the common area maintenance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes and insurance  to the tenants and there fore  the tenants will absorb part of this increased operating cost 
most of the leases provide for percentage rent after a certain minimum sales level is achieved 
thus  during highly inflationary periods  when retail sales at the malls increase  the company should receive additional rental income through percentage rent increases  partially offsetting the effect of inflation
