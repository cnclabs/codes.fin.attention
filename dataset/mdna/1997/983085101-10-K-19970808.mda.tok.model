item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended may  fiscal year compared to year ended may  fiscal year the company s revenue increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year as a result of higher sales volume at the company s forgings and castings divisions 
these sales volume increases during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year are reflected by market as follows a million increase in aerospace  a million increase in energy and a million decrease in other 
the reasons for the strength in the aerospace market were higher airplane and engine build rates and higher demands for spares by aerospace engine prime contractors 
although there were higher extruded pipe shipments to energy customers for fiscal  the shipments to energy customers were impacted by the week shutdown of the  ton vertical extrusion press in houston due to the industrial accident at the houston  texas facility of wyman gordon forgings  inc the cause of the decrease in other markets is primarily due to the decline in the titanium head golf club business because of oversupply  cost disadvantages and decreased demand 
revenues in fiscal year and  to a lesser extent  in fiscal year  were limited by raw material shortages and production delays caused by capacity constraints of the company s suppliers 
the company believes that the increase in order activity reflects a continued increase in spares demand and new business resulting from increasing production rates on commercial aircraft by commercial airframe primes 
the company s backlog increased to million at may  from million at may  this increase resulted from the following factors higher build rates of the company s engine and airframe customers  higher prices for the company s aerospace products  particularly as reflected in the new long term agreements ltas which went into effect on january   and an increase in overdue orders to customer delivery dates as a result of shipping delays at the company due to capacity constraints and raw material unavailability 
the company does not expect that this rate of increase in backlog will continue since it expects that customer orders will not increase at the same rates as in the recent past  that prices will moderate and that capacity additions installed by the company and its suppliers will enable the company to meet its customer demands in a more timely fashion 
of the company s total current backlog  million is shippable in the next twelve months 
because of the additional production capacity that the company and its suppliers are installing  the company believes that it will be able to fulfill those twelve month requirements 
the company s gross margins were in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year the improvement in gross margins resulted from higher production volumes  continued emphasis on cost reductions  productivity gains resulting from the company s continuing efforts toward focusing forging production of rotating parts for jet engines in its houston  texas facility and forging production of airframe structures and large turbine parts in its grafton  massachusetts facility and continuing realization of cost reductions from synergies associated with the integration of cameron in fiscal year and fiscal year the company believes that the improvements in gross margin would have been greater except that the company incurred higher raw material costs which could not be passed on to customers as a result of the then existing ltas with its customers 
beginning in the second half of fiscal year  higher demand required the company to purchase certain raw materials under terms not covered by ltas with its vendors 
the current rebound in demand for many of these raw materials  especially nickel and titanium  resulted in significant market price increases which negatively affected the company s gross margins 
the company began to see pricing relief for its products in early calendar when certain ltas that the company negotiated with its customers went into effect allowing the company to pass some raw material price increases on to its customers 
gross margins in fiscal year were also negatively impacted by price and demand declines within the titanium golf club head business because of oversupply  cost disadvantages and decreased demand

year ended may  fiscal year compared to year ended may  fiscal year the company s revenues increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year due to higher sales volume in the company s aerospace  energy and other markets 
these sales volume increases during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year are reflected by market as follows a million increase in aerospace  a million increase in energy and a million increase in other 
the cause of the strength in these markets was higher demands for spares from aerospace engine prime contractors and higher extruded pipe shipments to energy customers

additionally  the company believes that continuing realization of cost reductions from synergies associated with the integration of cameron also contributed to this higher ratio 
these favorable trends were offset somewhat by production delays resulting from the raw material shortages experienced during fiscal years and additionally  in the second half of fiscal year  the higher spares demand referred to above required the company to purchase certain raw materials under terms not covered by ltas with its vendors 
the company simultaneously entered into supply customer and purchase vendor ltas in order to minimize its raw material price exposure to an anticipated volume level 
to the extent that the demand was greater than anticipated by the ltas  the company was required to purchase raw materials at market prices 
the rebound in demand for many of these raw materials  especially nickel and titanium  resulted in significant price increases by the company s vendors which negatively affected the company s gross margins
