the quarterly consolidated financial data reflect  in the opinion of management of the company  all adjustments which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends 
quarters ended june  march  december  september  in thousands  except per share amounts sales     gross profit     total operating expenses     income loss from operations    net interest income income before provision for income taxes    net income    earnings per common and common equivalent share weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares     quarters ended june  march  december  september  in thousands  except per share amounts sales     gross profit     total operating expenses     income from operations     net interest income income before provision for income taxes     net income    earnings per common and common equivalent share weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares     seasonal fluctuations the company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in its sales and other financial results that it believes have resulted and will continue to result primarily from its customers and users buying patterns 
these buying patterns have typically adversely affected orders for the company s products in the third quarter of each fiscal year 
although it is difficult to predict the future seasonality of sales  the company believes that future seasonality should be influenced at least in part by customer and user buying patterns similar to those that have historically affected the company 
quarterly financial results are also affected by new product introductions and line extensions  the timing of large orders  changes in product sales or customer mix  vendor and customer pricing  production levels  supply and manufacturing delays  large customers inventory management and general industry and economic conditions 
the seasonality of the company s financial results and the unpredictability of the factors affecting such seasonality make the company s quarterly and yearly financial results difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuation 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company financed its operating cash needs primarily from internally generated funds 
the company s cash and cash equivalents at june  decreased to  from  at june  in fiscal  net cash of  provided by operating activities offset net cash of  and  used in investing and financing activities  respectively

of the  net amount used in the company s investing activities   was used to acquire primarily machinery and equipment and secondarily computer equipment and software 
of the  net amount used in the company s financing activities   was used to repurchase  shares of common stock 
in august  the board of directors increased the number of shares of common stock that the company is authorized to repurchase under its existing stock repurchase program by  shares  with funds to pay for any such repurchases to come from day runner s available cash resources 
as of september    shares remained for repurchase under this program 
in august  the company used approximately  of its available cash resources to repurchase  shares from certain of its officers and directors 
accounts receivable net at june  increased by  or  from the amount at june  primarily due to the growth in sales and secondarily due to a change in the payment terms extended to a large customer 
primarily because of this change in payment terms  the average collection period of accounts receivable at june  increased to days from days at june  inventories increased by  or  from the june  amount primarily because of a planned inventory build up done in preparation for the company s end of calendar year selling period 
at june   day runner had  outstanding under its  bank line of credit and had also used the line of credit to secure outstanding letters of credit of approximately  which reduced the availability under the line of credit to approximately  effective september   the company increased its line of credit from  to  borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at either the bank s prime rate or libor plus  at the company s election  and are due and payable on november  see note to consolidated financial statements 
the company is currently negotiating its line of credit and expects that it will be able to renew it for one year on terms generally no less favorable than those of its current credit line 
the company has not incurred significant losses or gains from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the continuing expansion of the company s international operations could  however  result in larger gains or losses as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as those subsidiaries conduct business in whole or in part in foreign currencies 
the company believes that cash flow from operations  vendor credit  its existing working capital and its bank line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy the company s anticipated cash requirements at least through fiscal nonetheless  the company may seek additional sources of capital as necessary or appropriate to finance acquisitions or to otherwise finance the company s growth or operations  however  there can be no assurance that such funds if needed will be available on favorable terms  if at all
