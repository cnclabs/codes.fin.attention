item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the matters addressed in this discussion  with the exception of the historical information presented  are forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties  including the risks discussed under the heading risks that affect our business and elsewhere in this report 
introduction the following tables and discussion present certain financial information on a comparative basis 
the company s fiscal results reflect the fourth quarter acquisition of cray research in a business combination accounted for under the purchase method 
to provide a meaningful comparison of fiscal and fiscal results  certain items revenue  gross margin and operating expenses other than merger related expense are presented on a pro forma combined basis as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of fiscal and excluding the results of the cray business systems division which was disposed in the first quarter of fiscal in addition to the actual fiscal results 
certain fiscal cray research amounts have also been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation

the revenue growth rate declined substantially from in fiscal to in fiscal however  the revenue growth rate of includes incremental cray research revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal excluding the effect of cray research revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal  the fiscal growth rate would have been 
factors contributing to the fiscal decline in the revenue growth rate included the significant product transitions which were not completed until the fourth quarter  as well as softness in international business  particularly in europe 
as illustrated by the company s fiscal results  the process of completing new products and rapidly bringing them into volume production entails substantial risks 
see risks that affect our business product development and introduction 
the mix of revenue between servers and graphics systems changed significantly in fiscal  an expected result of the cray research acquisition 
while the company experienced revenue growth in fiscal across its server product line  particularly in the high performance segments  graphics systems revenue was down 
server and graphics systems unit volumes increased in each of the years presented 
server product revenue per unit increased and graphics systems revenue per unit decreased in fiscal compared with pro forma fiscal  while overall product revenue per unit has remained substantially unchanged 
service revenue  which is comprised of hardware and software support and maintenance  remained fairly constant as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal compared with pro forma fiscal the percentage of service revenue to total revenue in these two periods is higher than that for due principally to the additional cray research installed base 
while the company s geographic revenue mix had in recent years been shifting towards its international operations  in fiscal that trend was reversed  principally due to weakness in european business as compared to prior periods 
revenue from rest of world  principally japan  represented approximately of total revenue in fiscal  in pro forma fiscal and in fiscal revenue growth in japan slowed in fiscal compared with prior periods partially as a result of a strengthened us dollar 
european revenue was also somewhat adversely affected by currency changes 
the company s consolidated backlog at june  was million  compared with backlog of million at june  gross margin cost of product and other revenue includes costs related to product shipments  including materials  labor  overhead and other direct or allocated costs involved in their manufacture or delivery 
costs associated with non recurring engineering revenue are recognized in research and development expense 
cost of service revenue includes all costs incurred in the support and maintenance of the company s products 
silicon graphics overall gross margin decreased from in pro forma fiscal to in fiscal the decline was due principally to product transition costs and relatively higher revenue in the us where margins typically are lower as compared with international margins 
in fiscal  the overall gross margin decreased to from in fiscal the decrease was due principally to discounting on product sales resulting from increased competition  as well as the effect of amortization in the fourth quarter of fiscal of purchase accounting adjustments made to the carrying value of acquired inventory and service contracts 
the company s gross margins are affected by a number of factors  including geographic and product mix  and will fluctuate from period to period 
the company expects its gross margins to be higher in fiscal than in fiscal  following completion of the major product transition in late fiscal furthermore  the cray research purchase accounting adjustments to inventory and service contracts are now fully amortized and thus will have no further financial statement impact 
gross margins will nonetheless continue to be affected by competitive pricing programs 
see risks that affect our business 
operating expense research and development spending in fiscal increased in absolute dollars compared with pro forma fiscal  as the company continued its new product development programs 
research and development spending also grew as a percentage of total revenue to from  largely because the company failed to achieve its planned revenue 
research and development spending increased in absolute dollars to million from million and as a percentage of total revenue to from in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in the amount of expense resulted in part from the inclusion of million of cray research expenses in the fourth quarter  as well as spending on projects related to new products introduced in fiscal because of the company s belief that success in its marketplace requires a continuous flow of new products  it expects to continue to increase the dollar amount of research and development spending in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars to  million from million and as a percentage of total revenue to from in fiscal compared with pro forma fiscal the increase in the amount of expense resulted from costs of new product introductions as well as from direct costs related to the increase in sales personnel during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars to million from million and was unchanged as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in the amount of expense resulted in part from the inclusion of million of cray research expenses in the fourth quarter  as well as continued investments in the company s sales organization 
the company expects selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of anticipated revenue in fiscal to be roughly comparable to the fiscal level 
impact of currency the net effect of currency changes was not significant in any of the past three fiscal years  although currency fluctuations have had and can have material impacts on particular quarters 
other operating results acquired in process technology the company recognized a one time  non tax deductible charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal for in process technology acquired in the cray research merger that had not yet reached technological feasibility and that had no alternative future use 
merger related expenses merger related expenses in fiscal relate primarily to the cray research acquisition and consist principally of costs associated with the integration of silicon graphics and cray research information systems  accounting processes and marketing and human resource activities 
the company expects to incur an additional million of similar merger related expenses during fiscal interest expense consolidated interest expense increased in fiscal and in fiscal principally as a result of borrowings associated with the cray research acquisition 
the company does not expect a significant change in the level of interest expense in fiscal interest income and other  net consolidated interest income and other  net for fiscal decreased compared with fiscal  reflecting lower interest income due to significantly lower average invested cash balances  costs associated with the expansion of the company s economic hedging program and the write off of an investment in a software company 
consolidated interest income and other  net for fiscal increased by over the prior year 
this was primarily the result of higher invested cash balances prior to the closing of the cray research tender offer on april   offset by the company s million share of losses in a joint venture 
the company expects interest income and other for fiscal to increase due to improved cash flows as programs designed to improve asset management are implemented 
provision for income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately compared with in fiscal and in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal differs from the federal statutory rate and is lower than in prior periods primarily as a result of the reinstated us federal research tax credit  proportionately higher earnings in low tax jurisdictions  and proportionately higher foreign sales corporation benefits  offset partially by foreign losses for which no benefit has been recorded 
the rate also reflected the impact of the write off of acquired in process technology for which there was no tax benefit 
the company does not provide for us federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which it intends to permanently reinvest in those operations 
the effective tax rate for fiscal is expected to increase over the fiscal rate primarily due to proportionately lower anticipated earnings in low tax jurisdictions 
financial condition the company s cash position remained substantially unchanged in fiscal at june   cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments net of short term borrowings  totaled million  up slightly from million at june  operating activities generated million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal and net income was affected by a number of charges that did not use cash million of reduced gross margin associated with the write up of acquired cray research inventories and service contracts and a million charge for the write off of an investment in a software company in fiscal and the million write off of acquired in process technology and million of reduced gross margin associated with the write up of acquired cray research inventories in fiscal the impact of the fiscal and charges was somewhat offset by increased deferred tax benefit provisions  as well as  in fiscal  the minority interest in cray research loss  which did not provide cash 
the growth in fiscal receivables reflects higher sales levels and longer collection cycles 
inventory grew significantly in fiscal in support of the product transition as well as to support higher revenue levels 
the company believes its receivables and inventory levels are higher than its operations require and it has commenced programs designed to improve its asset management processes and reduce receivables and inventory levels 
investing activities  other than changes in the company s marketable investments  consumed million in cash during fiscal  compared with million during fiscal and million during fiscal cash outlays for capital expenditures were slightly lower as a percentage of total revenue than in fiscal cash outlays for other assets in fiscal were higher than in prior years and relate principally to spare parts built to support the company s new products introduced during the year 
the fiscal tender offer for cray research used approximately million of cash  net of cash acquired 
in december  the company s subsidiary in japan entered into long term borrowing arrangements under which it borrowed billion yen million at the fiscal year end exchange rate for a period of five years 
in september  the company exchanged million principal amount of new senior convertible notes due the senior notes for approximately of its outstanding zero coupon convertible debentures due the zero coupon debentures 
there was no change in the carrying value of the company s debt 
in each of the past three years the company s employee stock plans have been an additional source of cash 
in october the company announced a program to repurchase seven million shares of common stock to manage the dilution created by employee stock plans 
under this program   shares of common stock were repurchased for million 
the company has not repurchased any shares since it entered into its merger agreement with cray research in february at june   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments of million million  net of short term borrowings and up to million available under its three year revolving credit facility 
at this time the company expects fiscal capital expenditures to be comparable as a percentage of total revenue to fiscal in connection with the acquisition of cray research the company also has recorded an accrual of approximately million for exit costs related to exiting facilities and streamlining duplicate administrative activities 
during fiscal cash outlays for these activities were approximately million 
future cash outlays related to exit activities are estimated to be approximately million  most of which are expected to be incurred over the next two years 
the company s cash and marketable investments  along with the credit facility  cash generated from operations and other resources available to the company  should be adequate to fund the company s projected cash flow needs 
the company believes that the level of financial resources is an important competitive factor in the computer industry and  accordingly  may elect to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing in anticipation of future needs 
risks that affect our business silicon graphics operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
period to period fluctuations the company s operating results may fluctuate for a number of reasons 
delivery cycles are typically short  other than for certain large scale server products 
well over half of each quarter s revenue results from orders booked and shipped during the third month  and disproportionately in the latter half of that month 
these factors make the forecasting of revenue inherently uncertain 
because the company plans its operating expenses  many of which are relatively fixed in the short term  on expected revenue  even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a period s results to be substantially below expectations 
such a revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors  including lower than expected demand  supply constraints  delays in the availability of new products  transit interruptions  overall economic conditions or natural disasters 
the timing of customer acceptance of certain large scale server products may also have a significant effect on periodic operating results 
margins are heavily influenced by mix considerations  including geographical mix  the mix of service and non recurring engineering revenue  the mix of high end and desktop products and application software  as well as the mix of configurations within these product categories 
the company s results have followed a seasonal pattern  with stronger sequential growth in the second and fourth fiscal quarters  reflecting the buying patterns of the company s customers 
the company s stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility 
if revenue or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate impact on the company s stock price 
the stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to the company s performance 
product development and introduction the company s continued success depends on its ability to develop and rapidly bring to volume production highly differentiated  technologically complex and innovative products 
product transitions are a recurring part of the company s business 
during fiscal  for example  the company replaced most of its product line  including both graphics and server systems 
a number of risks are inherent in this process 
the development of new technology and products is increasingly complex and uncertain  which increases the risk of delays 
the introduction of a new computer system requires close collaboration and continued technological advancement involving multiple hardware and software design and manufacturing teams within the company as well as teams at outside suppliers of key components such as semiconductor and storage products 
the failure of any one of these elements could cause the company s new products to fail to meet specifications or to miss the aggressive timetables that the company establishes 
as the variety and complexity of the company s product families increase  the process of planning production and inventory levels also becomes more difficult 
in addition  the extent to which a new product gains rapid acceptance is strongly affected by the availability of key software applications optimized for the new systems 
there is no assurance that acceptance of the company s new systems will not be affected by delays in this process 
short product life cycles place a premium on the company s ability to manage the transition from current products to new products 
the company often announces new products in the early part of a quarter  while the product is in the final stages of development  and seeks to manufacture and ship the product in volume in the same quarter 
the company s results could be adversely affected by such factors as development delays  the release of products to manufacturing late in any quarter  quality or yield problems experienced by suppliers  variations in product costs  delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of the introduction of new products  and excess inventories of older products and components 
process re engineering the company is undertaking a series of programs aimed at redesigning some of its core business processes  including forecasting  supply chain management  order fulfillment and collection of accounts receivable 
the goals of these programs include more predictable results of operations  greater quality and customer satisfaction  and improved asset management 
the company believes that the success of these programs is critical to its long term competitive position 
implementing these changes will require  among other things  enhanced information systems  substantial training and disciplined execution 
there can be no assurance that these programs will be implemented successfully  or that disruptions of the company s operations will not occur in the process 
competition the computer industry is highly competitive  with rapid technological advances and constantly improving price performance 
as most of the segments in which the company operates continue to grow faster than the industry as a whole  the company is experiencing an increase in competition  and it expects this trend to continue 
this competition comes not only from the company s traditional unix workstation rivals and traditional supercomputing competitors  but also from new sources including the personal computer industry 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater technical  marketing and financial resources and  in some segments  a larger installed base of customers and a wider range of available applications software 
competition may result in significant discounting and lower gross margins 
desktop system strategy the company has under development a desktop system that will be based upon intel microprocessors and the windows nt operating system 
there can be no assurance that this system will be introduced  and in any event the system will not account for any material revenues in fiscal success in this market segment will require that the company adapt to the very different requirements of this higher volume  lower margin market  including lower cost manufacturing and distribution  marketing to a broader audience in markets that could extend beyond the company s traditional markets  and new approaches to customer interface and support 
the company will also be required to manage a complex product transition and to support a product line including multiple operating systems 
in particular  although the company plans to continue to invest in and support its current line of unix mips based workstations  there is a risk that revenue from this business will be materially reduced by the announcement of the new product 
the company believes that its future success will depend in significant part on its making the right strategic choices in this market segment and on executing its strategy effectively 
impact of government customers a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from sales to the us government  either directly by the company or through system integrators and other resellers 
sales to the government present risks in addition to those involved in sales to commercial customers  including potential disruptions due to appropriation and spending patterns and the government s reservation of the right to cancel contracts for its convenience 
export regulation the company s sales to foreign customers are subject to export regulations 
sales of many of the company s high end products require clearance and export licenses from the us department of commerce under these regulations 
the departments of commerce and justice are currently investigating the company s compliance with the export regulations in connection with the sale of several computer systems to a customer in russia in fiscal the company believes that it has complied in all material respects with all applicable laws and that this matter will be resolved without a significant adverse effect on the company s business 
however  there is no assurance that this matter will not have an unforeseen outcome that could impair the conduct of the company s business outside the united states 
the company s international sales would also be adversely affected if such regulations were tightened  or if they are not modified over time to reflect the increasing performance of the company s products 
development and acceptance of mips risc architecture most of the company s system products incorporate microprocessors based upon the company s mips risc microprocessor architecture 
the company licenses the manufacturing and distribution rights to these microprocessors to selected semiconductor manufacturing companies 
the company believes that the continued development and broad acceptance of the mips architecture are critical to its future success 
intellectual property the company routinely receives communications from third parties asserting patent or other rights covering the company s products and technologies 
based upon the company s evaluation  it may take no action or it may seek to obtain a license 
in any given case there is a risk that a license will not be available on terms that the company considers reasonable  or that litigation will ensue 
the company currently has patent infringement lawsuits pending against it 
the company expects that  as the number of hardware and software patents issued continues to increase  and as the company s business grows  the volume of these intellectual property claims will also increase 
employees the company s future success depends in part on its ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical  marketing and management personnel  who are in great demand 
business disruption the company s corporate headquarters  including most of its research and development operations and manufacturing facilities  are located in the silicon valley area of northern california  a region known for seismic activity 
operating results could be materially affected by a significant earthquake 
the company is predominantly self insured for losses and business interruptions of this kind 
global financial market risks the company s business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets  including foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s hedging policy attempts to reduce some of these risks  based on management s best judgment of the appropriate tradeoffs among risk  opportunity and expense 
the company regularly reviews its overall hedging policies  and it continually monitors its hedging activities to ensure that they are consistent with the company s policy and are appropriate and effective in light of changing market conditions 
management may as part of this review determine at any time to change its hedging policies 
though the company intends for its risk management policy to be comprehensive  there are inherent risks which may be only partially offset by the company s program should there be unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates 
because a significant portion of the company s revenue is from sales outside the united states  and many key components are produced outside the united states  the company s results can be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
the company is primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates on the german mark  british pound  japanese yen  french franc  and korean won 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the value as expressed in us dollars of us dollar based sales and costs decrease 
the opposite happens when the us dollar weakens 
because the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar  it benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  a strengthening of the us dollar tends to affect negatively the company s revenue and gross margins 
the company s currency hedging program currently involves hedging i net non us dollar monetary assets and liabilities and generally all server backlog where the delivery cycle is expected to exceed three months using currency forward contracts and ii a significant portion of anticipated quarterly revenue using currency options which expire within each fiscal quarter 
the company has generally not hedged capital expenditures  investments in subsidiaries or inventory purchases 
however  because the company procures inventory and its international operations incur expenses in local currencies  the financial effects of fluctuations in the us dollar values of us dollar based transactions frequently mitigate or tend to offset each other on a consolidated basis 
at june   the company had a notional amount of million in currency forward contracts related to net non us dollar monetary assets and liabilities and server backlog 
approximately million of such currency forward contracts expire within two months of fiscal year end and all but million expire during fiscal the currency forward contracts are principally denominated in german marks million  british pounds million and japanese yen million  with the remainder distributed across over twenty other currencies 
at june   the aggregate fair value of the company s currency forward agreements was million 
the company also had million in japanese yen denominated borrowings  million in swiss franc denominated borrowings and million in other foreign currency denominated borrowings at june  the aggregate fair value of these borrowings at june  was million 
the company s investment securities and substantially all of its debt instruments carry fixed rates of interest over their respective maturity terms 
the company does not currently use derivatives  such as swaps  to alter the interest characteristics of its investment securities or its debt instruments 
the company s investment securities represented of total assets at june  investment securities aggregating million mature during fiscal at fixed rates averaging  and investment securities aggregating million mature in fiscal at fixed rates averaging 
the aggregate fair value of the company s investment securities at june  equaled its carrying value of million 
with respect to its interest bearing liabilities at june   million of the company s million in short term borrowings were in reverse repurchase agreements average rate of that were repaid in july and all but million of its million in long term borrowings are at fixed rates average rate of 
the aggregate future principle cash flow and fair value of the company s borrowings at june  were million and million  respectively 
the differential between the future cash flow and fair value is primarily attributable to the company s zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due with an ultimate maturity value of million and a fair value of million
