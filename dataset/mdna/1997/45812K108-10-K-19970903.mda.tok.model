item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ipec is a delaware corporation primarily engaged in designing  manufacturing  marketing and servicing equipment for the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
the company is organized into two divisions 
ipec planar manufactures cmp equipment and cmp related products 
ipec precision manufactures advanced plasma assisted chemical etch systems and metrology equipment for use primarily in manufacturing silicon wafers and semiconductor devices 
financial information for fiscal and has been restated to reflect the discontinuation in fiscal of ipec clean 
ipec incurred net losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  compared to net income of  in fiscal the company s fiscal net loss resulted from a million charge net of taxes for estimated losses on disposal of ipec clean  a million loss net of taxes from ipec clean operations in fiscal and a million pretax charge for asset write downs due to the discontinuation of the avanti program development effort 
the company s fiscal net loss resulted from a one time pretax charge of million for the purchase of in process research and development in connection with the acquisitions of ipec planar portland and ipec precision 
see risk factors operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations for varied reasons 
the company s revenue is derived from the sale of products and related spare parts and service 
the company recognizes product and spare part revenue when the product or part is shipped 
service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of service contracts or in some cases upon completion of service 
the company s gross margin has varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to many factors and is especially dependent on the percentage of sales through distributors  materials costs  product mix and favorable terms given to customers to introduce new products  penetrate new markets and accelerate purchases 
the company sells directly in the united states  and such sales historically have had a higher gross margin than indirect international sales 
gross margins in any period may not be indicative of margins for future periods 
because ipec precision s customer base is new  the company believes that ipec precision s gross margin could be lower than the gross margin for the company s cmp tools 
as new products are introduced by ipec precision in future quarters  the company s gross margin may decrease 
see risk factors operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations for varied reasons 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected items of the company s consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue percent of total revenue fiscal year ended june  revenue cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses research and development purchased research and development selling  general and administrative program discontinuance charge total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest income interest expense other income  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income loss fiscal year compared to fiscal revenue 
revenue was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in demand for semiconductor capital equipment in fiscal and the company s lack of a high throughput oxide process cmp system 
on a quarterly basis  revenue increased sequentially every quarter in fiscal from million in the first quarter of fiscal to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenue declined to million in the first quarter of fiscal  followed by sequential quarterly revenue growth in fiscal  resulting in quarterly revenue of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenue from international sales represented and of total revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from ipec precision represented and of total revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from the company s largest customer represented and of total revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
accelerated orders in fiscal represented of revenue 
see risk factors the timing of significant shipments and orders can impact quarterly results 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased as a percentage of revenue to for fiscal from in fiscal cost of goods sold during fiscal was adversely affected by a million charge related to warrants issued to a major customer in connection with an agreement permitting the company to accelerate certain deliveries of equipment in fiscal the charge was based on the market value of the warrant shares on the date of the agreement 
all warrants under the agreement have been issued  and all charges relating to the agreement have been incurred 
cost of goods sold also increased in fiscal due to increased customer service expenditures in fiscal the company s shift toward direct international sales and field service favorably affected fiscal gross margin through a reduction in distributor discounts compared to fiscal however  the margin improvement was partially offset by increased sales commissions recorded as selling  general and administrative expense 
research and development 
research and development expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal of this increase  million was due to development of the company s high throughput cmp tools and the related metal and oxide cmp processes 
research and development costs at ipec precision increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal these costs were incurred primarily to develop ipec precision s wafer shaping tools and metrology products 
research and development expenditures are expected to increase substantially in fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal program discontinuance charge 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company demonstrated that the avantgaard tool could be used for oxide planarization as well as metal planarization 
as a result  the company decided to discontinue the development of the avanti  an integrated mm high volume oxide cmp tool 
accordingly  the company incurred a million pretax program discontinuance charge in fiscal from write downs of inventory and assets relating to the avanti program 
see risk factors product or process development difficulties could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of lower average cash and cash equivalent balances in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily as a result of repayment of borrowings related to the acquisitions of ipec planar portland and ipec precision 
income tax expense 
the effective tax benefit rates for fiscal and were approximately and  respectively 
the lower tax benefit rate for fiscal resulted primarily from adjustments of deferred tax balances and state tax accruals 
loss from discontinued operations 
the operating results of ipec clean have been segregated from the continuing operations of the company and reported separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the loss from ipec clean net of taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the fiscal loss consisted of a million operating loss incurred in the first half of fiscal and a million one time charge for the estimated loss on disposal of ipec clean 
results of operations of ipec clean for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal were charged to an accrued liability included in this charge 
see risk factors future acquisitions and dispositions may require significant resources and adversely affect results 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue 
revenue was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was attributable to increased sales of million for ipec planar including sales for ipec planar portland  which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal and sales of million for ipec precision which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 
revenue from international sales represented approximately and of total revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal  due in part to the increased level of international sales  which were primarily made indirectly through distributors 
during fiscal  volume purchase agreement sales from ipec planar portland and ipec precision s initial sales to customers lowered gross margin by approximately 
research and development 
research and development expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal approximately million of the increased research and development expense resulted primarily from costs to develop the company s avanti and avantgaard cmp tools 
additional costs of million were also incurred at ipec precision for the development of plasma assisted chemical etching and metrology technologies 
purchased research and development 
the company incurred purchased research and development charges of million in fiscal as a result of the acquisitions of ipec planar portland and ipec precision 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal the absolute dollar increase was primarily due to the addition of personnel  sales commissions and additional depreciation and amortization resulting from acquisitions and the company s new planar phoenix facility 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal as a result of higher levels of invested cash  particularly in the first and second quarters of fiscal higher cash balances in fiscal resulted from the exercise of warrants in late fiscal  with net proceeds to the company of million 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal as a result of higher borrowing levels 
debt financing occurred during fiscal to acquire ipec precision and to construct a new manufacturing facility in phoenix 
a substantial portion of the company s financing was consolidated with a million term loan and a million revolving loan facility agreement with a bank in the fourth quarter of fiscal income tax expense 
as a result of the write offs in fiscal  the company s effective tax benefit rate was in fiscal due to the company s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal  the effective tax rate was 
these net operating loss carryforwards were fully utilized in fiscal loss from discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of the one time charge for purchased research and development of million related to the acquisition of ipec clean in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents of million as of june   an increase of million from june  the increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from cash generated from operations of million  proceeds from the sale leaseback of the company s  square foot phoenix manufacturing and administrative facility of million  issuance of  shares of series c preferred stock all of which were subsequently converted to common stock for million and additional net borrowings of million 
increases in working capital  primarily inventory and accounts receivable  and capital expenditures used cash of million and million  respectively in fiscal as of june   the company had million of working capital compared with million as of june  the company s accounts receivable increased to million as of june  as compared to million as of june  the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to more favorable credit terms granted to certain international customers and to customers purchasing initial avantgaard systems 
the company s inventory increased to million as of june  from million as of june  this was primarily due to ramping of production of the company s avantgaard and avantgaard systems and increased levels of manufacturing at ipec precision 
see risk factors operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations for varied reasons 
the company s property  plant and equipment decreased to million as of june  from million as of june  primarily as a result of the sale leaseback of the phoenix manufacturing and administrative facility in fiscal total long term debt increased to million as of june  from million as of june  primarily as a result of borrowings under the company s revolving loan facility 
total long term debt as a percentage of stockholders equity increased to as of june  from as of june the company entered into a loan agreement with a bank in april under the terms of the agreement  as modified  the company received a million term loan and a million revolving loan facility to provide working capital and for general corporate purposes 
the loan agreement has been modified to allow an increase of the revolving loan facility from million to million from the beginning of the last week of each fiscal quarter through the end of the first week of the subsequent quarter 
proceeds from the loan agreement were utilized to pay million of debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of ipec precision 
the million term loan was paid with the proceeds from the million sale leaseback transaction in fiscal the loan agreement includes various covenants  including  among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios and limitations on the amount of dividends that can be paid to stockholders 
the company was in compliance with these covenants as of june  the loan agreement has been extended to april as of june   million was outstanding under the revolving loan facility 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operations through at least the next months 
the company s cash needs depend on  among other things  whether its sales continue to expand  which would require greater investments in working capital  and on whether the company is forced by competitive pressures and commercial terms to continue or increase extended terms for accounts receivable 
if the company requires additional cash  there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed  or  if available  will be available on satisfactory terms 
in order to raise capital  the company may issue debt or equity securities senior to the outstanding common stock and may incur substantial dilution 
the failure to obtain additional financing when needed on satisfactory terms would also hinder the company s ability to invest in capital equipment and working capital 
risk factors the company s limited operating history has involved annual and quarterly losses 
prior to the company s acquisition of ipec planar phoenix in fiscal  the company did not have significant revenue 
the company had net losses in fiscal and of million and million  respectively 
operating results in fiscal include a net loss of approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal  due to one time charges net of taxes of approximately million for discontinuation of the business of ipec clean and of a research and development program 
operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties  and there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable in future periods 
operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations for varied reasons 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including industry wide changes in the demand for semiconductors or for semiconductor production equipment generally and  in particular  for high performance semiconductors with smaller line widths and multiple layers  the timing of significant shipments  accelerations  delays  cancellations or postponement of orders  the gain or loss of significant customers  competitive pressures  availability and costs of components from the company s suppliers  the timing of product announcements and introductions and process qualifications by the company  its customers or its competitors  the ability of the company to manufacture  test and deliver products in a timely and cost effective manner  the level of field service operations  the timing and structure of acquisitions and dispositions or spin offs  changes in the mix of products sold  the level of international sales  which historically have had lower margins than domestic sales  delayed or canceled construction of wafer fabrication facilities by customers  research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s and its customers products  reductions in personnel  discontinuance of operations  and the sufficiency of personnel and capital resources to support operations 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to anticipate or respond timely to changes in any of the factors listed above 
the company has experienced adverse effects from some of these factors in the past and may experience them in the future 
in the second quarters of fiscal and  the company incurred net losses due to one time charges associated with the ipec planar portland and ipec precision acquisitions 
the company incurred a loss in the first quarter of fiscal  primarily due to a decline in demand for semiconductor capital equipment  the company s lack of a high throughput oxide process cmp system  unprofitable operations at ipec precision and increased cost of goods sold resulting from the issuance of warrants to a major customer as described below 
the company incurred a net loss in the second quarter of fiscal  due to a million charge net of taxes for estimated losses on disposal of ipec clean and a million pretax charge for asset write downs due to discontinuation of the company s avanti product development effort 
the semiconductor equipment market experienced an industry wide slowdown in the second half of calendar  which adversely affected sales of the company s cmp polishing equipment 
the company s revenue from sales of cmp equipment in each of the first three quarters of fiscal was lower than such revenue in each of the first three quarters of fiscal fiscal revenue was below fiscal revenue 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
in future quarters  the company s operating results may not meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such an event  the market price of the common stock would be materially adversely affected 
the timing of significant shipments and orders can impact quarterly results 
the company derives most of its revenue from the sale of products in a price range from  to million per unit  and clustered systems can be priced much higher 
as a result  the timing of individual shipments can have a significant impact on the company s results of operations for a particular period 
the company has previously experienced order and delivery delays and cancellations which caused the company to miss its quarterly revenue and profit projections  including during the first quarter of fiscal  and there can be no assurance that the company can avoid such order and delivery delays in the future 
during the first quarter of fiscal  a significant customer agreed to accelerate certain orders into the first three quarters of fiscal  which could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain orders from this customer in fiscal these accelerated orders represented of the company s revenue in fiscal cost of goods sold increased in the first three quarters of fiscal by   and  respectively  due to the issuance of certain warrants in connection with this acceleration 
orders which the company has included in its backlog may be cancelled 
for example  the company removed from its backlog orders of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  primarily due to delays in construction of a wafer fabrication facility for submicron systems in thailand 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders 
ongoing expenditures for product development and engineering make it difficult to reduce expenses in a particular quarter if the company s sales goals for the quarter are not met 
any inability to reduce spending quickly enough to mitigate any revenue shortfall would magnify the adverse impact of the revenue shortfall on the company s results of operations 
see md a results of operations 
the company depends on a small number of major customers 
a small number of customers account for a significant percentage of the company s orders and revenue 
in fiscal  intel represented of the company s revenue 
in fiscal  intel and ibm represented and  respectively  of the company s revenue 
in fiscal  intel  ibm and motorola represented  and  respectively  of the company s revenue 
the company anticipates that its revenue will continue to depend on a limited number of major customers  although the companies considered to be major customers and the percentage of the company s revenue represented by each major customer may vary from quarter to quarter 
several of the company s major customers  including intel  must determine shortly the extent to which they will adopt the company s avantgaard or avantgaard  particularly for the oxide process  or comparable high throughput products from the company s competitors 
the loss of a major customer  any material reduction in orders by such customers  including reductions due to market or competitive conditions or the determination of any such customer not to adopt the company s next generation products  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future success depends in part upon its ability to obtain orders from new customers  as well as the financial condition of its customers and the general economy 
the company depends on broader industry acceptance of cmp and the avantgaard and avantgaard the cmp process has not been broadly adopted by semiconductor manufacturers for volume production 
ipec defines semiconductor manufacturers using cmp in volume production as companies using ten or more cmp systems 
most semiconductor manufacturers who have cmp equipment use it only for pilot line production  and few semiconductor manufacturers produce commercial quantities of ics using cmp machines 
to date  the company s products have been used primarily to manufacture advanced semiconductor logic and memory devices 
while industry analysts have projected significant future growth for the cmp polisher market  these projections depend on the analysts assumptions  and variations in industry demand can occur during the several years included in the projections 
there can be no assurance that projected industry growth will occur or that semiconductor manufacturers will adopt cmp processes for volume production 
lack of growth in the semiconductor industry and the determination of such manufacturers not to adopt cmp processes for volume production would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future results depend on sales of the avantgaard  avantgaard and avanti cmp wafer polishing systems 
the avanti m cmp wafer polishing system is based on older technology and is sold primarily to one customer  with shipments expected only through calendar because shipments of the avanti m are limited and the avanti does not offer the same throughput or footprint as the avantgaard or avantgaard or other high throughput cmp systems  the company expects its reliance on sales of the avantgaard and avantgaard to increase in the future 
as of june   the avantgaard had been shipped to nine customers and the avantgaard had been shipped to two customers 
the avantgaard was initially designed solely to planarize metal layers and has not been broadly adopted for this purpose in volume production 
the company s oxide process for the avantgaard and avantgaard was recently developed and has not been widely accepted 
several customers are qualifying a new production level oxide cmp process for these systems  and the company believes that the oxide process is being used in production by a very limited number of customers 
the avantgaard was designed to integrate cmp  metrology and wafer cleaning in a single unit with both oxide and metal capability 
if commercial use does not confirm the utility of the avantgaard and avantgaard for both oxide and metal processes  or if customers do not broadly adopt the avantgaard and avantgaard  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
the company s future results also depend on sales of ipec precision s products  which are currently oriented toward semiconductor wafer manufacturers and have not been widely adopted by these or other semiconductor industry customers 
there can be no assurance that customers will accept these products or that these products can be sold profitably or in volume 
the company must develop new products due to technological change 
the company derives most of its revenue from sales of cmp equipment and related products by ipec planar 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological changes and product obsolescence 
sales of certain of the company s products generally depend on new semiconductor fabrication facility construction projects and facility upgrades by customers 
the company s strategy depends in part on developing and introducing products that lower the semiconductor manufacturer s cost of ownership  which involves a number of factors  including product acquisition and operating expenses  throughput  reliability  footprint and wafer yields 
the company believes that its future success will depend in part upon its ability to enhance its existing products  develop new products and qualify new processes on its cmp systems to address technological changes and customer requirements 
product or process development difficulties could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company s current development efforts include mm wafer cmp systems  plasma assisted chemical etch systems  metrology technologies and copper dual damascene processes 
semiconductor equipment companies often experience delays in completing advanced products and processes 
in the past  the company has experienced delays in developing new cmp tools and processes and the plasma assisted chemical etch system 
the company cannot assure that any product in development will be completed as scheduled or that completed products or processes will be commercially adopted 
due to the complexity and sophistication of the company s products and related automation software  the company s products from time to time may contain defects or bugs which can be difficult to correct 
furthermore  as the company continues to develop and enhance its products  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify and correct defects in a timely manner 
ipec precision may require a large amount of capital in order to commercialize its current products and products under development 
if any of the company s products currently under development are not commercialized in a timely manner  the company could be required to write off inventory and other assets related to the development project  and the company could lose customers and revenue 
for example  the company incurred a million pretax asset write off in the second quarter of fiscal for discontinuance of the avanti product development program 
to the extent products developed by the company are based upon anticipated changes in semiconductor production technologies  sales for such products may be adversely affected if other technology becomes accepted in the industry 
the company may be adversely affected by the intensely competitive market in which it participates 
the semiconductor equipment industry is an intensely competitive market 
the company believes that direct domestic and international competition in cmp polishing systems and clustered cmp polishing and cleaning systems is likely to increase substantially 
the company is aware of a number of companies currently marketing cmp systems that directly compete with the company s systems  including applied materials  ebara  speedfam and strasbaugh 
competition is increasing significantly in the market for high throughput planarization systems 
the company is aware that other capital equipment manufacturers not currently involved in the development of cmp systems may also attempt to enter and develop products for this market or to develop alternative technologies which may reduce the need for the company s products 
for example  lam research  a semiconductor production equipment supplier  recently acquired ontrak  a manufacturer of wafer processing equipment which has developed a cmp tool 
the company anticipates that its customers will be increasingly inclined to utilize multiple cmp suppliers 
therefore  successful process qualification of the company s cmp systems may not lead to exclusive source supplier relationships with its customers in the future 
the company also believes that other companies are developing or marketing products which compete with the company s plasma assisted chemical etch systems and metrology equipment and that such competition may increase in the future 
the trend toward consolidation in the semiconductor equipment industry has made it increasingly important to have the financial resources necessary to compete effectively across a broad range of product offerings  to fund customer service and support on a worldwide basis and to invest in both product and process research and development 
certain current and potential competitors  including applied materials  provide customers with evaluation tools and have substantially greater financial resources and name recognition and more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing and customer service and support capabilities than the company 
in addition  current and potential competitors  including applied materials  that supply a broader range of semiconductor capital equipment may have better relationships with semiconductor manufacturers  including the company s customers 
the company expects its current competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and processes  and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics 
new product introductions or product announcements by the company s competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s existing products and could adversely affect the acceptance of new products 
moreover  increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is subject to risks associated with international sales 
international sales accounted for approximately and of the company s revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
the company s international sales historically have had lower gross margins than domestic sales since these sales have been made through distributors  which purchase products from the company at a discount to list price 
the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenue in future periods 
margins on international sales may vary in the future depending on the level of sales made through distributors 
international sales are subject to certain inherent risks  including tariffs  embargoes and other trade barriers  staffing and operating foreign sales and service operations  managing distributors and collecting accounts receivable 
the company is also subject to risks associated with regulations relating to the import and export of high technology products 
the export of the company s products to certain countries is limited by law 
the company cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of the company s products in the future will be implemented by the united states or any other country 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause the company s products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
while the company s sales are currently denominated only in us dollars  future international activity may result in foreign currency denominated sales 
gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
the company s strategy relies on increased penetration of the asian market 
the company believes that its future success will depend in part upon continued acceptance of its products by asian semiconductor manufacturers 
this market segment is large  represents a substantial percentage of the worldwide semiconductor manufacturing capacity  and is difficult for foreign companies to penetrate 
asian manufacturers may develop alternatives to cmp or may enhance existing manufacturing techniques such as spin on glass and deposited glass to achieve acceptable yields for drams and other integrated circuits involving three or more metal layers and line widths at or below micron 
the company currently sells its products in asia through sales representatives and distributors 
the company is establishing a fully staffed asia pacific division to service this market 
a direct presence in these markets  particularly japan  requires the allocation of substantial management and financial resources  may adversely affect the company s relationship with its current distributors  and may increase a number of risks related to international sales as described above 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical  causing fluctuations in the company s operating results 
the company s business depends upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductor devices  primarily for the opening of new or expansion of existing fabrication facilities which  in turn  depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductor devices and products utilizing such devices 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant overall growth in recent years  which has resulted in growth in the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry has had a severe adverse effect on the industry s demand for semiconductor processing equipment 
in certain instances  industry downturns have lasted for extended periods of time 
because the company believes that it must maintain research and development and customer service and support expenditures even during industry downturns  any downturn in the semiconductor industry could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that past growth in the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries  or the resulting growth in the company s business  can be sustained in the future or that the downturns in the market will not reoccur 
the company s planned operations assume that a significant portion of new orders will result from demand from semiconductor manufacturers building or expanding fabrication facilities for advanced multi level semiconductor devices with design requirements of micron and below  and there can be no assurance that such demand will exist 
past acquisitions have adversely affected operating results 
the company s growth in annual revenues from fiscal through fiscal has resulted not only from expansion of its core cmp business  but also from acquisitions in fiscal  and the company s expansion through acquisitions has resulted in significantly higher operating expenses  particularly because the company s strategy initially has been to operate each acquired business independently  resulting in separate marketing  customer support and administrative functions 
the companies acquired generally had not operated profitably before their acquisition by ipec 
ipec clean  acquired in fiscal  has never operated profitably and was discontinued by the company in the second quarter of fiscal  resulting in a million charge net of taxes in that quarter 
ipec precision has only recently achieved significant revenue from shipments of production equipment 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to integrate or operate profitably any acquired entity 
ipec precision joint development program may require significant resources and adversely affect results 
the company has entered into an agreement in principle with memc to develop a family of wafer shaping tools using ipec precision s plasma based planarization and metrology technology 
ipec precision and memc expect to establish an llc which would own the intellectual property developed and license it to ipec precision so ipec precision can make and sell the wafer shaping tools  paying a royalty to the llc 
ipec precision would share expenses related to the joint development program and pay royalties to the llc on the sale of newly developed plasma wafer shaping tools 
the company has not entered into a definitive agreement at this time 
there can be no assurance that the company will enter into a definitive agreement or that the joint development program would be successful 
because no definitive agreement has been finalized  the company s obligations and the financial consequences of such an arrangement cannot be predicted 
disposition of ipec clean may require significant resources and adversely affect results 
the company may dispose of or spin off portions of its business which the company determines are not complementary to its strategy 
the company plans to dispose of ipec clean by selling or closing down its operations by the end of calendar discussions with potential acquirors are at an early stage  and there can be no assurance of the terms  if any  of a sale 
in the event a sale cannot be achieved by the end of calendar  the company plans to shut down ipec clean s operations 
the ipec clean disposition effort could absorb significant management time and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
future acquisitions may require significant resources and adversely affect results 
the company s strategy is to obtain additional wafer fabrication technologies and may involve  in part  acquisitions of products  technologies or businesses from third parties 
the company also may make acquisitions for other reasons  including to obtain additional distribution capacity in specified geographic markets 
an acquisition could absorb substantial cash resources  require the company to incur or assume debt obligations  or involve the issuance of additional common stock  which could dilute the company s existing stockholders 
an acquisition which is accounted for as a purchase  like the company s past acquisitions  could involve significant one time charges  or could involve the amortization of goodwill over a number of years  which would adversely affect earnings in those years 
an acquired entity may have unknown liabilities  and its business may not achieve the results anticipated at the time of the acquisition 
an acquisition or disposition would absorb significant management time and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company would be adversely affected if suppliers could not deliver goods and services 
the company relies on a limited number of independent manufacturers to provide certain components in assemblies made to the company s specifications and use in the company s products 
in the event that the company s subcontractors were to experience financial  operational  production or quality assurance difficulties that resulted in the reduction or interruption of supply to the company  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the company purchases certain key components from qualified vendors for which alternative qualified sources are not currently available 
any prolonged inability to obtain adequate amounts of qualified components would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company depends on its key personnel and has appointed a new chief executive officer 
the company s future success is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management  technical  sales and support personnel 
there is intense competition for such personnel  particularly in phoenix  arizona  which has a relatively low unemployment rate  and the company may experience difficulty in hiring skilled personnel 
ipec recently announced the appointment of roger d 
mcdaniel to the position of president and chief executive officer effective september  mr 
mcdaniel will oversee all financial and operational aspects of the company 
thomas c 
mckee  ipec s president and chief operating officer from october to august  will remain with the company through december as chief operating officer and serve as a consultant until february lack of a smooth transition of financial and operational control to mr 
mcdaniel  the loss of certain key employees or consultants  or the company s inability to attract and retain new key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
during july and october  the company effected reductions in its work force to reduce its expenses and may do so in the future 
repeated layoffs could adversely affect the retention of employees and could adversely affect the company s ability to hire new personnel in the future 
personnel terminations at ipec precision included technical personnel  who could be difficult to replace if ipec precision successfully markets its products and requires additional engineering staff to support customers 
see business employees 
the company depends on proprietary technology  and protection is uncertain 
the company s success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of its technology 
patents issued to the company may not provide the company with meaningful advantages and may be challenged 
the two initial patents relating to the company s single wafer rotational planarization system products the avanti m and avanti are scheduled to expire in september in  the technology covered by these patents was licensed on a royalty free basis to a competitor 
this license was granted pursuant to a settlement arrangement in which the company also incurred settlement obligations aggregating million  of which  remained outstanding at june  to the extent that a competitor of the company is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on the company s technology  it may be difficult or impossible for the company to obtain necessary intellectual property protection in the united states or other countries where such competitor conducts its operations 
moreover  the laws of foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the company also relies on trade secrets that it seeks to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties 
these agreements may be breached  and the company may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
the company s trade secrets may also become known to or independently developed by others 
the company is subject to infringement claims
