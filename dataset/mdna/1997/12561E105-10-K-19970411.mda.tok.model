revenues company operated restaurants 
revenues from company operated restaurants  comprised mainly of sales from carl s jr 
restaurants  increased million or to million in fiscal as compared with million in fiscal carl s jr 
revenues for fiscal accounted for sales increases of million  while revenues from the company s rally s  summit and casa bonita restaurant concepts accounted for million  million and million of revenues from company operated restaurants  respectively  in fiscal fiscal revenues included approximately million from the company s boston market operations 
on a same store sales basis  the company s carl s jr 
sales  which are calculated using only restaurants open for the full years being compared  increased as compared with a increase a year ago 
this marks the second consecutive yearly increase in same store sales and the highest same store sales reported by the company s carl s jr 
chain in nearly a decade 
per store averages in company operated carl s jr 
restaurants continued to increase in fiscal and reached  on a period rolling basis  an increase of  over the prior year and the highest per store average attained since fiscal the increase in revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants is primarily the result of the continued momentum in the company s various sales enhancement programs that were implemented in fiscal these programs include the image enhancement of its restaurants through a chain wide remodeling program  the continuation of its conversion of existing carl s jr 
locations into carl s jr 
green burrito dual brand restaurants and the continued focus on promoting great tasting new and existing food products through increased innovative advertising 
an increase in the number of company operated restaurants operating in fiscal as compared with the prior year also contributed to the increase in revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants 
revenues from company operated restaurants totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared with fiscal this increase was primarily the result of the sales enhancement programs that were implemented in fiscal also contributing to the rise in revenues were higher average sales and transaction counts per restaurants and an increase in the number of carl s jr 
restaurants in operation in fiscal as compared with the increase in same store sales in fiscal over fiscal was the first yearly increase in same store sales experienced by the company in six years 
franchised and licensed restaurants 
revenues from franchised and licensed restaurants for fiscal increased to million over fiscal  while fiscal revenues decreased million  or  as compared with fiscal the fiscal increase is largely due to increased royalties from  and food purchases by  franchisees as a result of higher sales volume at franchised carl s jr 
restaurants  partially offset by a decrease in the number of franchised and licensed carl s jr 
restaurants operating as compared with the prior year 
the decrease in was largely due to lower prices of food and other products supplied to franchisees by the company  which were passed along to franchisees  along with a slight decrease in the number of franchised carl s jr 
restaurants in operation in fiscal as compared with fiscal operating costs and expenses company operated restaurants 
restaurant level margins of the company s restaurant operations decreased in fiscal to as compared with fiscal  primarily reflecting the impact of higher operating costs from summit s family style restaurant concepts since the date of acquisition 
the family style restaurant segment of the restaurant industry typically has lower margins than the quick service segment of the industry  mainly due to increased labor and food costs 
excluding the million effect of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  during the first quarter of fiscal  the company s restaurant level margins for the fiscal year would have been 
while the company s consolidated restaurant level margins decreased in fiscal  the company s efforts to reduce the restaurant level cost structure of its carl s jr 
restaurants  which began in fiscal  have resulted in significant improvement in the company s carl s jr 
restaurant level margins 
these margins  as a percentage of revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants  were   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
these improved results in the company s carl s jr 
restaurant level operating margins in fiscal reflect the company s continued commitment to improve the cost structure of its carl s jr 
restaurants  particularly in the areas of improving labor productivity and reducing workers compensation claims and losses 
the restaurant level margin improvement in fiscal was primarily attributable to material declines in payroll and other employee benefit costs 
the company s carl s jr 
food and packaging costs have remained relatively consistent at  and of revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal and  food costs increased marginally due to increased pressure from commodities prices and a change in the mix of products sold to higher food cost products  such as the big bacon star which was introduced in the first quarter of fiscal  the guacamole bacon cheeseburger which was introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the crispy chicken sandwiches which were introduced during the third quarter of fiscal  and the famous star  which is offered at participating restaurants at and is currently the company s only value priced product 
carl s jr 
payroll and other employee benefit costs  as a percentage of revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants  declined in fiscal to and decreased in fiscal to 
these significant reductions in payroll and other employee benefit costs were achieved despite the october  increase in the federal minimum wage 
the cost reductions came primarily as a result of labor productivity programs implemented during fiscal to further decrease costs and improve direct labor efficiencies 
moreover  the company added new safety and other programs in fiscal  which  coupled with changes in state regulations  have resulted in a decrease in work related injuries and reduced the company s worker s compensation claims and losses during fiscal and many of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal and state minimum wage laws 
recent legislation increasing the federal minimum wage as of october  has resulted in higher labor costs to the company and its franchisees 
an additional increase in the federal minimum wage will become effective in september further  as a result of recent california state legislation  the state minimum wage in california was increased in march the company anticipates that increases in the minimum wage may be offset through pricing and other cost control efforts  however  there can be no assurance that the company or its franchisees will be able to pass such additional costs on to customers in whole or in part 
occupancy and other operating expenses for the company s carl s jr 
restaurant chain  as a percentage of revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants  were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decreases in fiscal and were largely due to the company s efforts to maintain costs at the prior fiscal year levels  which included reducing utility costs through the installation of energy efficient lighting during fiscal further  since these items are generally fixed in nature  they decrease as a percentage of company operated restaurant revenues as revenues increase 
franchised and licensed restaurants 
franchised and licensed restaurant costs have followed a similar trend over the past three fiscal years to the revenues from franchised and licensed restaurants 
these costs increased in fiscal to million while fiscal costs decreased million  or  to million 
the overall increase in fiscal is primarily due to increased food purchases by carl s jr 
franchisees  partially offset by a decrease in the number of franchised and licensed restaurants in operation in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the fiscal decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in the number of franchised restaurants in operation 
advertising expenses 
advertising expenses have become increasingly important in the current competitive environment and  accordingly  the company increased the dollars spent on advertising by million to million in fiscal as compared with fiscal  while keeping advertising expenses as a percentage of revenues from company operated restaurants relatively consistent with the prior fiscal years 
in fiscal  the company spent more on advertising production and increased the number of weeks on electronic media as compared with the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  a new advertising agency was appointed to assist the company in redirecting its carl s jr 
marketing programs and restoring its reputation of offering superior quality products 
an innovative new advertising campaign was introduced in may and the company has seen seven consecutive quarterly increases in same store sales in company operated carl s jr 
restaurants as compared with the corresponding quarters of the prior year since the start of the campaign 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million to million  or of total revenues 
however  as a percentage of total revenues  these expenses decreased as compared to the prior fiscal year  reflecting the economies of scale the company is achieving by collapsing certain costs from acquired businesses into the company s existing infrastructure 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal is primarily the result of recording incentive compensation accruals for regional restaurant management and selected corporate employees as a result of improved restaurant operating performance 
also contributing to the increase were increased amortization expense and various corporate legal expenses 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses amounted to million  or of sales  a decrease of million  or from fiscal during fiscal  the company benefited  through reduced payroll and employee benefit costs  from various reorganizations and headcount reductions that occurred both in fiscal and prior years 
also contributing to the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was the formation in april of boston west  whereby this entity assumed the operations of all of the company s existing boston market stores and agreed to fulfill the company s remaining obligations under its area development agreement with bci

other income  net  is primarily comprised of investment income  interest on notes and leases receivable  gains and losses on sales of restaurants and income and loss from long term investments 
other income  net  increased million from fiscal  primarily due to an increase in investment income as a result of increased cash levels on hand during fiscal and gain on the sale of restaurants in fiscal as compared with a loss in the prior year 
these fiscal increases in other income  net  were partially offset by a decrease in interest income on notes receivable due to the sale of certain of its franchise notes receivable in fiscal in addition  included in fiscal was a million decrease in the company s boston market investment which resulted from the company recording its pro rata share of the losses from boston west 
other income  net  decreased to million in fiscal  largely due to decreases in investment income resulting from lower investment levels as compared with fiscal financial condition liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased million to million in fiscal total cash provided by the company s consolidated operations increased million to million which was primarily due to increased revenues and increased gross margins from its carl s jr 
restaurants 
consolidated investing activities required the company to use million in cash to fund capital additions of million  to complete the acquisitions of certain franchised restaurants  summit and casa bonita  net of cash acquired  of million  and to fund the company s purchase of its long term investment in rally s of approximately million and note receivable from checkers of approximately million 
cash outflows from investment activities were partially offset by cash proceeds of million as a result of the sale of the company s marketable securities portfolio and property and equipment and from the collection on and sale of notes receivable  related party receivables and leases receivable 
financing activities provided the company with million primarily as a result of cash proceeds of million from the company s common stock offering 
see note to notes of consolidated financial statements 
the increase in new borrowings of million were primarily used to fund the acquisition of casa bonita and to replace an existing million term loan 
cash proceeds from the common stock offering  along with cash flows from operations and cash proceeds from the exercise of the company s common stock options  were used to reduce the company s long term debt by approximately million 
repayments of long term debt included the repayment of the credit facility which was used to fund the casa bonita acquisition  the repayment of the existing million term loan and the early repayment of indebtedness of million 
the company also used cash to reduce capital lease obligations by million and to pay dividends of million 
effective august   the company entered into a new credit agreement with a group of financial institutions 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the company borrowed the principal amount of million under a five year  fully amortizing term loan  the proceeds of which were used to repay existing indebtedness 
the credit agreement also provides the company with i a revolving credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes  under the terms of which the company may borrow from time to time up to million including a letter of credit subfacility of up to million  and ii a revolving credit facility for the purpose of financing investments in and acquisitions of other companies  under the terms of which the company may borrow from time to time up to million 
the amounts advanced  if any  to the company and remaining outstanding under the revolving acquisition facility will convert after two years into a three year  fully amortizing loan 
the company s revolving credit facility matures on july  as of january   no borrowings remained outstanding under this credit facility 
the credit agreement also includes customary affirmative and negative covenants which  among other things  restrict the company s ability to i incur or create indebtedness on or with respect to its properties  ii incur additional indebtedness  iii merge or consolidate with other entities  iv sell assets and v declare or pay dividends or repurchase shares of capital stock  subject in each of the foregoing cases to certain exceptions 
in addition  the credit agreement requires the company to maintain certain specified financial ratios and operating results 
as of fiscal year end  the company is in compliance with all of its covenants governing its credit facility 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company issued million shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share adjusted for the stock split 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
proceeds from the offering  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other related expenses  were million and were used primarily to repay indebtedness 
the company s primary source of liquidity is its revenues from company operated restaurants  which are generated in cash 
future capital needs will arise primarily for the construction of new carl s jr 
and taco bueno restaurants  the remodeling of existing restaurants  and the conversion of certain restaurants to the carl s jr 
green burrito dual brand concept 
the company plans to open up to new carl s jr 
restaurants and is evaluating opening additional new taco bueno restaurants in its existing markets during fiscal during fiscal  the company also expects to continue to remodel the remaining company operated carl s jr 
restaurants and to convert up to carl s jr 
locations into carl s jr 
green burrito units 
the company believes cash generated from its various restaurant concept operations  cash and cash equivalents as of january  and amounts available under the company s revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to satisfy the company s capital spending requirements for at least the next months 
if those sources of capital are insufficient to satisfy the company s capital spending and working capital requirements  or if the company determines to make any significant acquisitions of or investments in other businesses  the company may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
the sales  if any  of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to the company s shareholders 
impact of inflation management recognizes that inflation has an impact on food  construction  labor and benefit costs  all of which can significantly affect the company s operations 
historically  the company has been able to pass any associated higher costs due to these inflationary factors along to its customers because those factors have impacted nearly all restaurant companies 
during fiscal and fiscal  however  management emphasized cost controls rather than price increases  given the competitive pressure within the quick service industry 
new accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share sfas  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas introduces and requires the presentation of basic earnings per share which represents net earnings divided by the weighted average shares outstanding excluding all common stock equivalents 
dual presentation of diluted earnings per share reflecting the dilutive effects of all common stock equivalents  will also be required 
the diluted presentation is similar to the current presentation of fully diluted earnings per share 
management believes the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations
