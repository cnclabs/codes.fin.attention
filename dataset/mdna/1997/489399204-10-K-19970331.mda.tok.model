in addition  commissions decreased in compared to due to the disposition of a portion of the company s commercial brokerage division  including european operations  and the separate sale of the company s australian subsidiary

see note for further discussion of the restructuring 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes that cash and cash equivalents at december  of million  plus expected cash generated from ongoing real estate marketing operations  continued sales of real estate owned  collections from notes receivable  as well as the working capital line of credit  will provide the company with sufficient resources to fund its present and reasonably foreseeable operations 
the company has not historically required major capital expenditures to support its marketing operations 
however  the company believes that its ability to make advances to its clients marketing budgets provides a competitive advantage 
the company s liquidity may in the future be adversely affected by lower commission rates  or increased contributions to marketing budgets  caused by competition from other marketing companies 
liquidity could also be adversely affected by the company s ability to sell real estate it has acquired 
as discussed in note and  the company is obligated under various notes payable and mortgages payable  which are secured by notes receivable and real estate held for sale 
approximately million of notes payable and million of mortgages are due in the company anticipates that these amounts will be repaid from proceeds from the sale of the related collateral 
as discussed in note  in february  the company acquired approximately  shares of its common stock from a former officer and director 
the terms required an initial payment of  which has been paid  plus two additional payments of approximately  each on april  and september  the company expects to be able to meet these future obligations from cash generated from operations 
to the extent the company engages in additional strategic investments  including real estate and note portfolio acquisitions  the company may need to obtain third party financing which could include bank financing or the public sale or private placement of debt or equity securities 
the company has historically been successful in arranging the required financing for its investment activities 
the increase in in its acquisition line of credit to million  and the bank financing obtained for acquisitions  supports the company s belief that it should be able to continue to secure the capital resources necessary to fund its investments
