management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following sets forth certain factors that have affected the company s results of operations  and management believes will continue to affect the company in the future 
expansion strategy commencing in late  the company began its initial expansion outside its traditional core markets in california 
this strategy  as in the past  was primarily centered around clustering stores in order to take advantage of operating efficiencies and to promote the strouds brand name in each new market 
over the past two years the company has opened superstores in the greater chicago and minneapolis markets midwest markets  superstore in the greater washington  dc market and store in reno  nevada 
subsequent to the year just ended  the company opened an additional store in the greater washington  dc market 
to date  sales volumes have been below expectations resulting in higher store operating  administrative and advertising costs as a percent of sales than is currently experienced in the company s california markets 
management believes a critical factor associated with the lower sales is the time it takes to penetrate the market and build consumer awareness of the strouds brand name and image in new markets 
during fiscal  the company believed it achieved the critical mass necessary for advertising in its midwest markets and increased its expenditures for advertising in an effort to develop consumer awareness of the strouds concept and build store sales volumes 
though the company has made progress in building sales volumes in these markets  they remain below anticipated levels 
in addition to the expansion into new markets outside of california  the company continues to open and or reposition stores in its california markets 
during fiscal  the company opened new superstores  expanded superstore and converted superstore and original format stores to strouds outlet format 
in addition  the company opened a  square foot prototype store in irvine  california offering a broad range of home furnishings and design services 
the company has committed to open additional superstores in this continued development activity in california has from time to time negatively impacted the sales of existing strouds stores 
management has believed that the benefits of strengthening its market presence and adjusting to demographic shifts in the california marketplace have generally outweighed the reduced sales impact experienced by an existing nearby strouds store 
in march  the company opened new superstore in the greater washington  dc market  which accounted for the majority of the capital expenditures and preopening page expenses were incurred in fiscal the company s commitment to open additional new superstores in fiscal will result in preopening expenses of approximately  per store and are expensed as incurred 
the company anticipates its required investment for each new superstore  before leasehold improvements  will be approximately million per store in fiscal  consisting of approximately  for store furniture  fixtures and equipment and approximately million for inventory 
in addition  the company anticipates spending  in the aggregate  approximately  for leasehold improvements in connection with its new store development plans 
change in store format in  the company changed from its original format  which included stores ranging from  to  square feet  to a larger superstore format  which average approximately  square feet 
the company has continued to increase the size of its superstores which have averaged approximately  square feet for new and expanded stores opened in the past two years 
since the opening of the first superstore  all of the company s new stores have used the superstore format other than stores opened as outlet stores and the company s prototype store in irvine  ca 
by the end of fiscal  the company will have converted all of its original format stores to the superstore or outlet format 
the primary purpose of the company s shift to the superstore format has been to meet the demands of an increasingly competitive environment 
these stores feature improved merchandise presentations  new merchandise categories  higher quality fixtures and an overall ambiance that management believes substantially improves the strouds shopping experience 
the company s superstores  on average  have experienced higher sales volume but lower sales per square foot than the company s original format stores 
as a result  although the company s occupancy costs per square foot have not risen significantly  occupancy cost as a percentage of net sales have increased 
this has adversely affected the company s gross profit  which includes buying  occupancy and distribution expenses 
because of the impact of the shift in store format on average store level performance  results in different periods may not be comparable 
restructuring and asset impairment in light of the factors noted above  the company initiated a comprehensive restructuring and cost reduction plan the restructuring plan  resulting in a pretax charge of  or per share 
the restructuring plan is designed to improve the operating performance of the company through the closure or disposition of up to underperforming stores and implementing cost reduction measures  including workforce reductions  to more closely align the company s cost structure with future expected revenues 
management believes that the closing and disposition of up to stores will approximate years to complete 
the company recorded a pretax charge of  or per share for the impairment of certain operating assets 
the principal factors leading up to the charge were current and future operating losses on individual operating assets  whereby the carrying value of certain operating assets exceeded the current estimate of future cash flows from the related asset 
the company will continually evaluate the performance of its operating assets for the factors noted above and  if conditions warrant  write down the value of such assets commensurate with the current and estimated future operating performance

additionally  higher occupancy costs associated with new and expanded stores  where average store sales were lower  reduced gross margin 
the reduced gross margin was due to a higher level of markdown volume versus a year ago

page during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of million 
this included a pretax charge of million or per share for a comprehensive restructuring plan the restructuring plan 
the restructuring plan is designed to improve the operating performance of the company through closure or disposition of up to underperforming stores and implementing cost reduction measures  including workforce reductions  to more closely align the company s cost structure with future expected revenues 
the million cost consisted of the write off of fixed assets  termination or lease subsidy costs  inventory liquidation expenses and employee severance and other related costs 
the net sales and store level operating losses in of the stores to be closed were approximately million and million  respectively 
management plans to continue to operate these stores  where appropriate  in the current format or if circumstances warrant  convert to the outlet format in order to improve cash flow and minimize the ultimate cost of disposition 
accordingly  future earnings may be negatively impacted until the restructuring plan is completed

sales from noncomparable stores ie  new stores and expanded or replacement stores increased by million 
net sales were reduced by million due to one store closure last year 
page the decrease in comparable stores sales consisted of a decrease of through the first three quarters of fiscal which represented a continuation of the declining sales trend which began during the fourth quarter of fiscal management believes the decrease in comparable store sales is volume related and primarily attributable to several factors including a general economic slowdown as a result of rising interest rates 
rising interest rates in the last half of had the effect of reducing turnover of both new and existing housing and reducing disposable income as adjustable mortgages were revised upward 
management believes that spending on home furnishings is correlated with housing turnover 
in addition  economic conditions in california  where the majority of the company s comparable stores are located  were further impacted by higher levels of unemployment related to continuing reductions in defense and construction spending  as well as the orange county bankruptcy and los angeles county s financial difficulties 
these events prompted southern california residents to be concerned about unemployment and increased taxes which had a dampening effect on consumer spending 
significant new competitive openings also contributed to lower sales levels 
approximately of the comparable stores were affected by new competitive openings which did not exist during fiscal similarly  the sales gains achieved in fiscal were aided by strong replacement business in the aftermath of the northridge  california earthquake and reduced competition from competitors whose stores were damaged 
comparable net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased 
an improving california economy and a smaller negative sales impact related to competitive openings for the fourth quarter of fiscal versus the same period a year ago contributed to the fourth quarter comparable sales growth

cost of sales  buying and occupancy for fiscal were million versus million for the same period a year ago  a million increase 
as a percent of sales  cost of sales  buying and occupancy increased to from for the same period a year ago 
the increase in cost of sales  buying and occupancy was due to lower comparable store sales and below average sales volumes for new store openings in the company s midwest markets 
lower sales volume had the effect of increasing occupancy costs as a percentage of sales one percentage point 
selling and administrative expenses for fiscal increased million to million versus million for fiscal and increased as a percentage of net sales from to 
the increase as a percent of sales was primarily due to labor and other store operating expense inefficiencies due to lower sales volume at comparable stores and lower than average sales volumes for new stores opened in the midwest

reduced spending levels for administrative support partially mitigated the overall increase in selling and administrative expenses

income tax expense was million for fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal the company s lower pretax income and effective tax rate  the result of increased tax deductions related to the exercise of non qualified stock options  contributed to the decrease in income tax expense

the company also plans to spend million in fiscal for replacement  enhancements and upgrades of its management information systems

page seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company s business is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations 
historically  the company has realized a higher portion of its net sales and an even greater proportion of its profits in the months of november  december and january 
additionally  the timing of promotional events may affect the company s results in different quarters from year to year 
the company may encounter different seasonality factors as it enters new markets outside of california 
the timing of new store openings and related preopening expenses  and the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  may also cause the company s quarterly results of operations to fluctuate
