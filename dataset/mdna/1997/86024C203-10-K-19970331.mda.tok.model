the company has taken certain continuing restructuring actions to adjust its expected production to the reduced order flow in liquidity and capital resources the company requires capital primarily to fund its ongoing operations  to service its existing debt and to pursue its strategic objectives including new product development and penetration of international markets 
the company s working capital needs typically increase because of a number of factors  including the duration of the manufacturing process and the relatively large size of most orders 
during the latter part of and during  the company has experienced an increased need for working capital resulting in continued high levels of borrowings under its bank credit facility 
the working capital needs are directly related to the slowness in orders in late and and certain product performance issues which have delayed deliveries  increased costs and delayed cash collections 
also  the growing international mix of the company s new orders which typically have less favorable cash flow terms than domestic orders  and the introduction of new products have resulted in increased borrowings

during periods of sales decline such as  the company s working capital provides cash as receivables are collected and inventory is utilized 
the large increase in working capital requirements during reflected increasing sales  particularly a growing proportion of international orders  which typically have less favorable cash flow terms  and the introduction of new products

the company believes  however  that significant progress is being made regarding resolving performance issues 
the reduced liquidity resulting from the order slowdown and collection delays required the company to fully draw upon its bank credit facility and contributed to the company s failure to make the payment of a million principal payment due june  to its senior subordinated note holders 
in addition  the losses incurred by the company in the three and nine months ended september  and for the year ended december  resulted in non compliance with a debt coverage ratio in the company s bank credit facility agreement and a net worth covenant in the agreement governing the senior subordinated notes 
the reduced liquidity has also impacted the company s ability to make timely payment with respect to its accounts payable 
as a result  the company has experienced delays in its ability to obtain raw materials and inventory 
as a result of negotiations with its bank and the holders of its senior subordinated notes  the company has obtained a series of temporary default waivers through november  the company modified its bank credit facility agreement in january providing for a bridge loan arrangement of the company s bank indebtedness through may  to date  no permanent agreement has been reached with the company s bank or the holders of the senior subordinated notes 
accordingly  all of the company s bank debt and the entire principal amount of the senior subordinated notes  together with accrued and unpaid interest has been classified as a current liability at december  pursuant to the terms of an intercreditor agreement entered into by the company  the bank and the holders of the senior subordinated notes  a standstill letter was issued by the bank on january  preventing any payments to the holders of the senior subordinated notes for a day period 
accordingly  the company did not make its scheduled interest payment to the holders of the senior subordinated notes at december  the company retained rauscher pierce refsnes  inc in to advise the board of directors on strategic and financial alternatives available to the company 
possible strategies considered included the addition of capital through a merger or business combination with other companies  raising additional equity  or possible sales of key assets of the company  all in an effort to maximize shareholder value 
in march  the company sold the assets  operations and certain liabilities of the bernal division see note c of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company s indebtedness was comprised primarily of a bank credit facility and the company s senior subordinated notes due september  in addition  the company s chairman has loaned the company  as described below 
as of december   there was outstanding million in senior subordinated notes  bearing interest at the rate of per annum  with principal payments of million being due on june  and each june thereafter  and a final payment of million at maturity 
as previously stated  the june  principal payment was not made 
under its credit facility at december   the company could borrow up to million in the form of direct borrowings and letters of credit 
after the sale of the bernal division in march  the maximum allowed borrowings were reduced to million 
as of december  there was million in direct borrowings and million in standby letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
at december   million of the company s borrowings were at the lender s prime rate of interest 
the amounts borrowed under the credit facility have been used for working capital 
both the agreement concerning the credit facility and the agreement with the holders of the senior subordinated notes provide for joint and several guaranties by the domestic operating subsidiaries of the company 
to secure the indebtedness and the guaranties  a first lien was granted to the lender  and a second lien was granted to the holders of the senior subordinated notes  on substantially all the assets of the company and its domestic divisions 
the borrowings under the credit facility and senior subordinated notes agreement are subject to various restrictive covenants related to financial ratios as well as limitations on capital expenditures and additional indebtedness 
the credit facility permits the company to borrow up to million for domestic acquisitions without lender consent 
the company is not allowed to pay dividends 
with the sale of the bernal division and assuming that the contemplated restructuring of its indebtedness is completed  and that one of several strategic  financial alternatives  principally the additional sale of assets  among others presently being pursued by the company is consummated  management believes that cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund its existing operations and repay scheduled indebtedness over the next months 
there can be no assurance that the company s restructuring efforts will be successful  or that the company s bank or the holders of the senior subordinated notes  who hold first and second liens on all assets of the company  will agree to restructured obligations consistent with the company s anticipated cash availability 
even if such agreement is reached  it may require agreements of other creditors and shareholders of the company  none of which is assured 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that future sales of assets  if any  can be successfully accomplished on terms acceptable to the company 
under current circumstances  the company s ability to continue as a going concern depends upon the successful restructuring of its agreement with its bank and the agreement with the holders of its senior subordinated notes  the further redeployment of assets  and a return to profitable operations 
if the company is unsuccessful it its efforts  it may continue to be unable to meet its obligations or fulfill the covenants in its debt agreements  as well as other obligations  making it necessary to undertake such other actions as may be appropriate to preserve asset values 
in addition  the company may incur  from time to time  additional short and long term bank indebtedness under its existing credit facility or otherwise and may issue  in public or private transactions  its equity and debt securities to provide additional funds necessary for the continued pursuit of the company s operational strategies 
the availability and terms of any such sources of financing will depend on market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or  if available  will be on terms and conditions acceptable to the company 
through december   the company s chairman and chief executive officer has loaned the company  for its short term cash requirements which is to be mandatorily repaid from proceeds of the banque de france receivable approximately million 
as of december   this amount has not been repaid 
the success of the company s plans will continue to be impacted by its ability to achieve a satisfactory resolution of the product performance and warranty issues  timely deliveries  acceptance of the ace system by the bank of england  the degree of international orders which generally have less favorable cash flow terms and require letters of credit that reduce credit availability  improved terms of domestic orders  and timely implementation of cost reduction measures 
while the company believes it is making progress in these areas  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these endeavors
