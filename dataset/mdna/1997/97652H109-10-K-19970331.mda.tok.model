historically  the company has generated operating and net losses and can be expected to do so for at least the foreseeable future as it continues to develop additional operating systems 
such losses may increase as operations in additional systems are commenced or acquired 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or sustain positive net income in the future 
as the company continues to develop systems  ebitda from more mature systems is expected to be partially or completely offset by negative ebitda from less developed systems and from development costs associated with establishing systems in new markets 
this trend is expected to continue until the company has a sufficiently large subscriber base to absorb operating and development costs of recently launched systems 
based on its current system launch schedule and targeted penetration and subscriber revenue rates  the company believes it will reach a subscriber level in its more mature systems those systems with positive system ebitda in the fourth quarter of to generate revenues sufficient to offset these operating and development costs 
ebitda is used to measure performance in the wireless cable industry 
however  ebitda does not purport to represent cash provided by or used by operating activities and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company made capital expenditures  exclusive of acquisitions of wireless cable systems and additions to leased license acquisition costs  of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenditures primarily relate to the purchase of equipment in the company s operating systems  as well as in future launch markets 
the company estimates that million in capital expenditures will be required over the next twelve months to continue to fund growth in its operating systems and future launch markets 
based on the factors and results discussed above  the company believes that the million in unrestricted cash at december  is sufficient to meet its expected capital and operating needs at least over the next nine to twelve months 
subject to the limitations of the indentures governing the senior notes and the senior discount notes  in order to accelerate its growth rate and to finance general corporate activities and the launch or build out of additional systems  the company may supplement its existing sources of funding with financing arrangements at the operating system level or through additional borrowings  the sale of additional debt or equity securities  including a sale to strategic investors  joint ventures or other arrangements  if such financing is available to the company on satisfactory terms 
as a result of issuing the senior notes and the senior discount notes and the possible incurrence of additional indebtedness  the company will be required to satisfy significant debt service requirements 
following the disbursement of all of the funds in the escrow account in october  a substantial portion of the company s cash flow will be devoted to debt service on the senior notes 
additionally  beginning on august   cash interest will begin to accrue on the senior discount notes and thereafter a substantial portion of the company s cash flow will be devoted to such debt service 
the ability of the company to make payments of principal and interest will be largely dependent upon its future performance 
many factors  some of which will be beyond the company s control such as prevailing economic conditions  may affect its performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to cover required interest and principal payments when due on the senior notes and the senior discount notes or other indebtedness of the company 
if the company is unable to meet interest and principal payments in the future  it may  depending upon circumstances which then exist  seek additional equity or debt financing  attempt to refinance its existing indebtedness or sell all or part of its business or assets to raise funds to repay its indebtedness 
the incurrence of additional indebtedness is restricted by the indentures governing the senior notes and the senior discount notes 
in managing its wireless cable assets  the company may  at its option  exchange or trade existing wireless cable channel rights for channel rights in markets that have a greater strategic value to the company 
the company continually evaluates opportunities to acquire  either directly or indirectly through the acquisition of other entities  wireless cable channel rights 
there is no assurance that the company will not pursue any such opportunities that may utilize capital currently expected to be available for its current markets
