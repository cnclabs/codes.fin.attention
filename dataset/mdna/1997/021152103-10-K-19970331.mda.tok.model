the majority of the company s research and development expenses were  and will continue to be in  sponsored research obligations paid to harvard university and its affiliated hospitals

there can be no assurance regarding the likelihood or materiality of any such future licensing agreements 
therafectin r amiprilose hci related expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with zero during the comparable period 
the company commenced its phase iii clinical trial for therafectin r in march before any commercially viable product from therafectin r may be developed  and any revenue generated therefrom  the company currently expects that approximately million dollars of additional future expense will be necessary 
there can be no assurance  however  that such expenditure will result in the approval of any compounds or that approval will ever be able to be obtained by the company 
general and administrative expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the company i expanding its operations  including its headcount  and ii incurring higher costs  primarily legal  public relations  and other professional services expenses  associated with being a publicly traded company during the entire year ended december  as compared with only a portion of the year ended december  interest income was  during the year ended december  as compared with interest income of  during the year ended december  the increase in related to higher average cash and investment balances associated with the company raising net proceeds of approximately million from two private placements completed in interest expense totaled  during the year ended december  as compared to  during the year ended december  interest expense incurred in included amounts related to i the issuance of million of notes payable during the first quarter of  ii the issuance of million of convertible subordinated debentures in the fourth quarter of  and iii the amortization of the discount and debt issuance costs associated with both debt instruments

as a result of its concentrated efforts on research and development  and therafectin r related expenses  the company has a history of incurring net operating losses and expects to incur additonal net operating losses for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  management believes that  at the present time  it is appropriate to conclude that it is more likely than not that the future benefits related to the deferred tax assets will not be realized and  therefore  has provided a full valuation allowance for these assets 
in the event the company achieves profitability  these deferred tax assets may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and expense

based on the lack of available evidence supporting that the appropriate clinical efficacy was demonstrated for the compounds acquired from greenwich  exclusive of therafectin  and the excessive costs and time estimated to develop these compounds  management does not expect to continue to pursue the research or development of these compounds
