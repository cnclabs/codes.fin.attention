item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview pairgain  founded in february  designs  manufactures  markets and supports products that allow telecommunications carriers and private network owners to more efficiently provide high speed digital service to end users over the large existing infrastructure of unconditioned copper wires 
the company s first product was pg  a two channel digital subscriber carrier system  which was initially shipped in late in  the company undertook the development of the higain system  which was first shipped in june the company s revenue growth subsequent to and its profitability beginning in the fourth quarter of are attributable to the market acceptance and increased sales of its higain systems 
in june  the company introduced its campus line of products  and in  began shipping its pg flex product  a small subscriber carrier system for delivering up to voice channels over two pair of copper wires 
higain systems represented the company s total revenues in each of the years  and although revenues from sales of the company s higain products have historically represented a substantial majority of the company s total revenues and are expected to continue to account for a majority of its revenues for the foreseeable future  the company believes that revenues from sales of its pg  campus  pg flex and other products will continue to increase in the future 
commencing in mid  the company began reducing the average sales prices of its higain products in an effort to increase market demand for its products and in anticipation of expected price competition 
these reductions have been significant  representing reductions of as much as in  in and in although future effects of price competition and other competitive pressures inherent in the company s business are uncertain  the company expects to continue to reduce the average sales prices of its higain and other products 
accordingly  the company s ability to maintain or increase revenues will depend in part upon its ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products at rates sufficient to compensate for the reduced revenue effect of such continuing reductions in the average sales prices of the company s existing products 
declining average sales prices may also adversely affect gross margins on the company s existing products if the company is unable to fully offset such reductions in average sales prices by reductions in the company s per unit costs 
declining average sales prices had a significant effect on gross margins in as they declined to from in during and the company s continuing effort toward cost reduction through engineering design changes  reduced prices for components  increased manufacturing efficiencies  and increases in volume resulted in improved gross margins  which climbed to in and however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to increase unit sales volumes  introduce and sell new products or further reduce its per unit costs in the future
