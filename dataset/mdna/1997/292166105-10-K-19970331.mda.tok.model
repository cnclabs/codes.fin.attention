item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
historical results are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period 
except for the historical information contained herein  the discussion in this form k contains or may contain forward looking statements which include statements in the future tense and statements using the terms believe  anticipate  expect  intend or similar terms that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed herein particularly in outlook issues and risks below  and in item business  as well as those factors discussed elsewhere herein or in any document incorporated herein by reference 
results of operations overview the following is a summary of certain factors which affect results of operations and which have generally applied to the company in all periods presented 
revenues the most significant components of the company s revenues are payments received from customers for gross salaries and wages paid to peo worksite employees and the company s service fee 
the company negotiates service fees on a client by client basis based on factors such as market conditions  client needs and services requested  the client s workers compensation and benefit plan experience  company administrative resources required  the expected profit  and other factors 
these fees are generally expressed as a fixed percentage of the client s gross salaries and wages except for certain costs  primarily employer s health care contributions  which are billed to clients on an add on basis 
because the service fees are negotiated separately with each client and vary according to circumstances  the company s service fees  and therefore its gross margin  will fluctuate based on the company s client mix 
revenues from stand alone risk management workers compensation services consist primarily of gross premiums charged to clients for such services 
the company also receives fee income for certain other types of services  such as those in connection with its driver leasing program which was commenced in as a result of the leaseway acquisition  although such fees have not yet been material to the company 
costs of revenues the company s primary direct costs of revenues include salaries and wages paid to worksite employees  employment related taxes  costs of health and welfare benefit plans  and workers compensation insurance costs 
the largest component of direct costs is salaries and wages to worksite employees 
although this cost is generally directly passed through to clients  the company is responsible for payment of these costs even if not reimbursed by its clients 
the company has recently begun extending credit terms to clients in certain industries 
see outlook issues and risks credit risks herein 
employment related taxes consist of the employer s portion of payroll taxes required under the federal income contribution act fica  which includes social security and medicare  and federal and state unemployment taxes 
the federal tax rates are defined by the appropriate federal regulations 
state unemployment rates are subject to change each year based on claims histories and size of payments  and vary from state to state 
workers compensation costs  whether relating to peo worksite employees or the company s stand alone risk management workers compensation program  include the costs of claims up to the retention limits relating to the company s workers compensation program  administrative costs  premium taxes and excess reinsurance premiums  and accidental death and dismemberment insurance which the company maintains to limit its losses 
in its arrangements with reliance through the company s wholly owned insurance subsidiary  and legion  the company retains workers compensation liabilities up to certain specified amounts 
retained workers compensation claims liability is recorded at the time a claim is reported to the company  in an amount equal to the retained portion of the expected total incurred claim 
the company also provides for claims incurred  but not reported  based on industry wide data and the company s past claims experience up to the retained limits 
the liability recorded may be more or less than the actual amount of the claims when they are submitted and paid 
while the company believes that its reserves are adequate for future claims expense  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
see outlook issues and risks 
changes in the liability are charged or credited to operations as the estimates are revised 
administrative costs include fees paid to reliance and legion and costs of claims management by third party administrators 
premium taxes include taxes and related fees paid to various states based on premiums written 
premium for excess reinsurance relates to premium payments to the company s insurers for the retention of risks above specified limits 
the company also purchases accidental death and dismemberment insurance which covers the company and its excess reinsurance carriers against catastrophic losses related to workers compensation claims up to certain limits 
see item risk management workers compensation program 
health care and other employee benefits costs consist of medical and dental insurance premiums  payments of and reserves for claims subject to deductibles and the costs of vision care  disability  life insurance and other similar benefit plans 
the company s health care benefit plans consist of a mixture of fully insured programs and partially self insured programs with specific and  in one program  aggregate stop loss insurance 
see item medical program 
the company recognizes a liability for partially self insured health insurance claims at the time a claim is reported to the company by the third party claims administrator  and also provides for claims incurred  but not reported based on industry wide data and the company s past claims experience 
the liability recorded may be more or less than the actual amount of ultimate claims 
while the company believes that its reserves are adequate for future claims expense  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
see outlook issues and risks 
selling  general and administrative expenses the company s primary operating expenses are administrative personnel expenses  other general and administrative expenses  and sales and marketing expenses 
administrative personnel expenses include compensation  fringe benefits and other personnel expenses related to the company s internal administrative employees 
other general and administrative expenses include rent  office supplies and expenses  legal and accounting fees  insurance and other operating expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include commissions to sales executives and related expenses 
the company s headquarters and phoenix operations are moving to new offices beginning in april  to accommodate the significant growth which the company has experienced in administrative employees 
this is expected to significantly increase the company s rent expense in future periods 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization consists primarily of the amortization of goodwill and acquisition costs from the company s prior acquisitions 
the company amortizes goodwill and acquisition costs over periods of three to thirty years  depending on the assets acquired  using the straight line method 
acquisitions generally result in considerable goodwill because peos generally require few fixed assets to conduct their operations 
because of the company s recent and possible future acquisitions  amortization costs are expected to increase substantially in future periods 
acquisitions period to period comparisons are substantially affected by the company s recent substantial growth through acquisition of other companies providing peo services 
the company has accounted for its acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  and prior period financial statements therefore have not been restated to reflect these acquired operations 
in addition to increasing revenues  acquisition activity can affect gross profits and margins because the industry mix of the acquired companies may differ from that of the company and because of the transition period after an acquisition in which the company acts to implement pricing changes where appropriate and to eliminate client relationships which do not meet the company s risk or profitability profiles 
because the company intends to focus in the short term on further integrating prior acquisitions  the company does not currently expect acquisition activity to be as extensive as in quarterly operating results revenues are also affected by bonus payrolls in the fourth quarter  which tend to increase due to the common practice of employers paying year end bonuses 
the effects of the flow through of such bonus payrolls to worksite employees are substantially higher in december than in any other month 
in addition to increasing revenues  these payments also affect margins because of the offsetting nature of bonus payments to worksite employees as costs 
quarterly margin comparisons are affected by the relative mix of stand alone risk management workers compensation services and full peo services in any particular period 
significant numbers of conversions from stand alone risk management workers compensation to full service peo arrangements such as those which have occurred in connection with certain company acquisitions would tend to increase gross profit amounts while decreasing gross margins because of the addition of pass through salaries and wages to both revenues and costs 
certain employment related taxes are based on the cumulative earnings of individual employees up to a specified wage level 
therefore  these expenses tend to decline over the course of a year 
since the company s revenues for an individual client are generally earned and collected at a relatively constant rate throughout each year  payment of such unemployment tax obligations has a decreasing impact on the company s working capital and results of operations as the year progresses 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  in thousands percent change revenues   cost of revenues   gross profit   selling  general and administrative   depreciation and amortization  interest income interest expense   net income   net income for the year ended december   was million  or 
per fully diluted share  reflecting significant growth from net income of million  or 
per fully diluted share 
revenues of million for the year ended december   were higher than the growth is the result of integration of several acquisitions  the growth in the company s stand alone risk management workers compensation program  direct peo sales and marketing efforts  and the efficient administration of existing business 
revenues revenues increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   a increase 
the increase in revenues was partially due to sales from the company s expanded peo sales force 
acquisitions accounted for a significant increase in revenues between the periods 
the number of worksite employees increased from approximately  at december   to approximately  at december  in  the company commenced placing risk management workers compensation services to clients which are not full service peo clients of the company 
as of december   the company provided risk management workers compensation services to approximately  workers as compared to  at december  revenues related to stand alone risk management workers compensation services were million in compared with million for the company recently began to experience the effects of competition and a general weakening in the workers compensation and employee benefits markets  which slowed revenue growth 
this trend has continued into policies in place at january  represent annualized premiums of approximately million 
each such policy is subject to renewal in subject to agreement of the parties 
cost of revenues cost of revenues increased from million for the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the increase in the company s business as explained in the section above and in the following discussion 
workers compensation expenses increased approximately to million in from million in  due primarily to the increase in earned premiums on the stand alone risk management workers compensation program and growth in the core peo business  including acquisitions 
the overall results of the company s risk management workers compensation program as measured against industry data can be attributed to the company s selectivity in new client acceptance  the effective use of safety inspections and safety programs and its ability to manage and close open claims coupled with stop losses of  and  per occurrence  the maintenance of accidental death and dismemberment insurance through chubb  no category iv high risk clients  and a day cancellation capability on peo business 
although the company believes its internal method of establishing reserves continues to be appropriate  the company commissioned an independent third party actuarial review of the company s workers compensation reserves at year end  as it had for year end in the review  the actuary primarily relied on industry wide data  while taking into account to a lesser extent than in past reviews esi s specific risk structure and philosophy  in determining its findings 
although the company believes that determining reserves based more heavily upon its actual historical experience is appropriate and adequately addressed its exposure  it determined to adopt the reserve levels determined by the review  and intends to use similar methodologies going forward which may have an impact on future periods 
see adequacy of loss reserves and loss and claims experience below in outlook issues and risks for a further explanation of risks and uncertainties relating to the company s establishment of reserves 
the following table provides an analysis of the company s workers compensation reserves from its partially self insured programs for the years ended december  and and the seven months ended december  in thousands reserve beginning of period  losses   payments   reserve end of period   the following table summarizes certain indicators of performance regarding the company s risk management department s ability to close out workers compensation claims in each of the years ended december incurred claims by calendar year approximate approximate approximate open claims open claims year ended total december  december  december number of  claims   n a gross profit the company s gross profit margin increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  this increase primarily was attributable to the company s stand alone risk management workers compensation program which was in place for the full year ended december   versus only eight months in the eight month period included approximately  hazar employees who were provided stand alone risk management workers compensation from may through september  when the hazar employees became included in the company s peo business 
the company generally earns a higher gross profit margin on revenues derived from its stand alone risk management workers compensation services than on revenues derived from the company s full service peo business because the peo revenues include significant and substantially offsetting revenue and expense items for payroll and payroll related costs for the worksite employees 
accordingly  the company s overall margin is affected in significant part by the mix of revenues derived from full service peo clients and clients for which the company provides only risk management workers compensation services 
the company also received the benefits of reduced administrative costs with camelback for the entire year ended december  as compared with the same period in which only included seven months of benefit because camelback was not operative until june the company also has increased the number of workers compensation claims managers to at december  compared to seven at december  the company believes that a continuous focus on maintaining a low ratio of cases per claim manager is a significant factor in controlling workers compensation expense 
in this regard  the company continues to implement a policy whereby the maximum number of active claims which each claims manager may handle is based on industry data  the company believes that this maximum is significantly less than the industry average 
see business risk management workers compensation program in item and adequacy of loss reserves and loss and claims experience in outlook issues and risks below 
selling  general and administration selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percent of gross profit  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from to during the year ended december  and  respectively 
factors contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in over are the integration of the operations of various acquisitions including an increase from corporate employees at december  to at december   resulting in a significant increase in personnel costs  and the expansion of the company s office space 
additionally  the company s results for the year reflected six months of expense for team services and five months of expense for leaseway  both recent acquisitions which historically have maintained a higher ratio of selling  general and administrative expense to gross profit than the company 
these factors which caused increases in selling  general and administrative expense were partially mitigated by improved systems utilization and economies of scale achieved within the company s operations  including consolidation of certain acquired companies administration 
the company s general liability insurance costs have increased due in part to the added corporate staff and increased costs for directors and officers liability insurance 
commission expenses and bad debt expenses increased in the year ended december  compared to due to the increase in revenues discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase to meet the needs of new business 
the most extensive growth in selling  general and administrative expenses has been in the risk management department 
this trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future 
the company has recently signed a seven year lease on new office space in phoenix  arizona containing significantly more space at higher rates than its existing offices  the approximate annual rental increase is expected to be million 
the company also expects that costs for professional services will increase in as a result of litigation recently brought against the company  see outlook issues and risks litigation 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization represented depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of organizational costs  customer lists and goodwill in the year ended december  and the increase was due primarily to depreciation of new phone and computer systems and goodwill amortization resulting from acquisitions  with hazar  leaseway  and mcclary trapp being the most significant 
amortization of goodwill from the hazar acquisition began in october  and amortization of leaseway and mcclary trapp began during  therefore  amortization costs will be higher in and future years 
amortization relating to the acquisitions completed in  and to date in is expected to be approximately million more in than in interest interest income increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   primarily due to interest earned on both the restricted cash and investments held for the future payment of workers compensation claims at camelback and cash held at the corporate level raised through the exercise of common stock purchase warrants and through operations 
interest expense increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to interest accrued on the company s revolving line of credit 
the line was first utilized in august and had an average outstanding balance of million for the five months ended december  the company anticipates its interest expense will significantly increase in future periods depending upon amounts borrowed under its new revolving credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources 
effective tax rate the company s effective tax rate provides for federal  state and local income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal is as compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for was positively impacted by a state tax benefit in the amount of approximately  relating to a change in estimate for taxes 
the effective tax rate would have been approximately without this benefit 
this downward year to year revision reflects a reduction resulting from the increased operations of the company s wholly owned subsidiary  camelback  which pays state premium tax rather than state income tax 
although the company believes that it has structured its camelback arrangements to qualify for such tax treatment  any disallowance of this tax treatment could materially affect the company s results of operations for the current fiscal year and future fiscal years 
while the company s effective tax rate will vary from time to time depending on the mix of profits derived from camelback and the company s various other profit centers and other factors  the company believes it will continue to benefit from the lower rate applicable to profits derived from camelback 
the company s estimated effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes for is also based on estimates of the following items that are not deductible for tax purposes a amortization of certain goodwill  and b one half of the per diem allowance relating to meals paid to truck drivers 
the tax rate used in each quarterly reporting period is generally an estimate of the company s effective tax rate for the calendar year 
outlook many factors may affect the company s operations and results as compared to as discussed in more detail above  some of the more significant factors include a narrowing of profit margins in the company s business which began to be felt in late and continues into  an increase in competition and an overall weakening in pricing for the company s services in the workers compensation and employee benefit markets  increased reliance on industry wide data relative to esi s specific risk structure and philosophy in estimating workers compensation reserves  certain tax benefits the company received in relating to prior years  and increased interest expense  lease payments  amortization and litigation expense 
additional factors which may impact the company s future operations and results are discussed below under outlook issues and risks 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  in thousands percent change revenues   cost of revenues   gross profit   selling  general and administrative   depreciation and amortization interest income net income  net income for was million or per fully diluted share  reflecting significant growth from net income of  or per fully diluted share 
revenues of million in were higher than in and were the most significant factor contributing to the increase in net income 
the growth results from the integration of the acquisitions of employment services of michigan  inc which has been renamed employee solutions midwest  inc esm and hazar  inc 
and certain of its subsidiaries hazar  the success of direct sales and marketing efforts of employee solutions east  inc esei and the efficient administration of existing business 
the company s focus on managing operating expenses also played a role in maintaining profit margins 
revenues revenues increased from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   a increase 
the increase in revenues was partially due to sales from the company s expanded sales force through esei  which commenced operations in june  plus the full year impact in of new business added throughout in addition  the acquisitions of esm  effective january   and hazar  effective october   accounted for revenues of million and million  respectively  in the year ended december  the number of peo worksite employees increased from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december  in  the company commenced placing risk management workers compensation services to clients which are not peo clients of the company and a portion of the increase in revenues during the year ended december  is attributable to this program 
a significant portion of the risk management workers compensation services results reflects the inclusion of approximately  leased employees of hazar from may  through october   at which time the company completed its acquisition of hazar and these employees became leased employees of the company 
as of december   the company provided risk management workers compensation services to approximately  non peo employees 
cost of revenues cost of revenues increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the increase in the company s business as explained in the paragraph above 
workers compensation costs decreased on a per leased employee basis during the year ended december  compared to due to the company s ability to execute effectively its risk management programs which include on site safety programs  active claims management and efficient execution of claims processing 
in addition  the new program utilizes the company s wholly owned insurance subsidiary  camelback  which was activated in may the company s state unemployment tax rate in arizona increased significantly in compared to gross profit the company s gross profit margin increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  this increase primarily was attributable to an increase in risk management workers compensation services related to non peo employees 
gross profit margin on revenues derived from risk management workers compensation services provided to non peo employees tends to be significantly higher than gross profit margin on revenues derived from the company s peo clients because the gross profit margin calculation with respect to peo clients includes significant and substantially offsetting revenue and expense items relating to payroll and payroll related costs 
the margin is affected in significant part by the mix of revenues derived from employee leasing clients and clients for which the company provides only risk management workers compensation services 
revenues during the year ended december  include risk management workers compensation revenues derived from hazar  whose leased employees were not leased employees of the company for a period of five months prior to the october  acquisition 
these employees became leased employees of the company for financial reporting purposes effective october   which affected the mix of the company s revenues for the quarter ended december  and reduced the gross profit margin in the fourth quarter below that for the entire year 
in  the company s gross profit margin was slightly impacted by the company s higher arizona unemployment tax rate 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  factors contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in over are the integration of esm and hazar operations  an increase from corporate employees at december  to at december   resulting in a significant increase in personnel costs  and the expansion of the company s office space by  square feet to  square feet at december  these factors which caused increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were partially mitigated by improved systems utilization and economies of scale achieved within the company s operations 
beginning february   the company increased such space by  square feet to accommodate the growth of the risk management workers compensation services staff 
the company s general liability insurance costs have increased due in part to the added corporate staff  and costs for directors and officers liability insurance also increased 
costs to operate esei  which began in mid  increased in to support the growth in the company s sales and marketing efforts throughout the country 
commission expenses increased in compared to at a rate greater than the increase in revenue between the periods because of the lower level of commissions applicable to the company s revenue 
in november  marvin d 
brody  chairman of the board  became chief executive officer of the company 
his compensation as ceo began january  effective october  three executive officers received increases in their compensation totaling  annually 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase to meet the needs of new business 
the most extensive growth in selling  general and administrative expenses is expected in the area of risk management workers compensation services 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization represented depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of organizational costs  customer lists and goodwill in the years ended december  and the increase was due primarily to depreciation of new phone and computer systems and goodwill amortization resulting from the acquisition of hazar 
interest income interest income increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   primarily due to interest earned on both the restricted cash held for the future payment of workers compensation claims at camelback and cash held at the corporate level raised through the exercise of common stock purchase warrants and through operations 
effective tax rate the effective tax rate for was compared with for the company s estimated effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes for the first three quarters in was  which estimated rate was based on estimates of the following items that are not deductible for tax purposes a amortization of certain goodwill  and b one half of the per diem allowance relating to meals paid to truck drivers 
in the fourth quarter of  the company successfully completed the transition of a significant portion of the per diem allowance programs back to client companies retroactive to january  the company s tax expense in excess of statutory rates for the year ended december  primarily was due to non deductible goodwill  as well as some non deductible per diem expenses 
the reduction in the company s effective tax rate in also resulted from an increased profit base over which non deductible goodwill and per diem allowances have less of an impact on the tax rate 
management believes the company s effective tax rate will decline in as non deductible goodwill and non deductible per diem allowances have an even lesser impact on a growing profit base  though no assurance of such decline or growth can be provided 
the tax rate used in each quarter is an estimate of the company s effective tax rate for the calendar year 
liquidity and capital resources the company defines liquidity as the ability to mobilize cash to meet operating  capital and acquisition financing needs 
the company s primary sources of cash traditionally have been from financing activities and operations  though operations represented a use of cash in primarily to finance receivables of acquired companies and stand alone risk management workers compensation clients 
cash used in operating activities was million during cash provided by operating activities was million and  in and operating cash flows are derived from customers for full peo services rendered by the company and for stand alone risk management workers compensation services 
payments from peo customers typically are received on or within a few days of the date on which payroll checks are delivered to customers  and cover the cost of the payroll  payroll taxes  insurance  other benefit costs and the company s administration fee 
the acquisitions of team services  leaseway and certain companies in the mcclary trapp group plus growth in the stand alone program decreased the company s operating cash flows in by approximately million as these operations extend credit terms generally from to days as is customary in their respective markets segments 
had it not been for these accounts receivable requirements in  the company would have generated cash flow from operations of approximately million 
stand alone risk management workers compensation services are billed in accordance with individual policies 
the company also extends credit terms for certain of its stand alone risk management workers compensation clients by billing less than the expected premium over the policy term  with the difference paid on a deferred basis after the end of a policy year 
as the company expands in these market segments or enters into new market segments  or extends credit terms to additional clients  its working capital requirements may increase 
cash provided by financing activities was million during compared to cash provided by financing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities during resulted primarily from the company s borrowing see below and the sale of the company s common stock upon exercise of warrants and options  offset by cash used to fund bank overdrafts of acquired companies 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in the years ended  and  respectively 
the primary use of cash in was for business acquisitions with leaseway and mcclary trapp accounting for approximately million of the million spent 
for  and  capital expenditures were   and  respectively 
fiscal capital expenditures consisted primarily of personal computers and other computer equipment to enhance its ability to support esi s increasing client and employee base 
in  the company intends to relocate its headquarters offices  and other phoenix operations  to a new facility 
the company anticipates that related leaseholds and improvements will be financed by the landlord as a buildout allowance  and subsequently reflected in rental payments 
moving costs and office furniture will represent cash outlays in the first and second quarters of of approximately million 
also during  the company expects to continue to invest in additional computer and technological equipment 
although the company continuously reviews its capital needs  management expects that capital expenditures will exceed those incurred in prior periods to meet the needs of the company s growing base of worksite employees 
at december  and december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents are generally invested in high investment grade instruments with maturities of less than days 
certain amounts of restricted cash and investments see below may have maturities beyond days but are highly liquid 
the company generally maintains large cash balances to meet its daily payroll and payroll tax obligations 
the company has developed a nationwide cash management program to minimize the requirement for cash on hand  though as the business continues to grow  cash requirements to meet daily obligations will increase 
the company is required through its fronting arrangements to maintain restricted cash and investments to secure the future payment of workers compensation losses 
such restricted cash and investments have been calculated by the company s fronting carriers based on estimates of the future growth in the company s business and ultimate losses on such business 
for this purpose  ultimate losses are actuarially determined by the fronting carriers utilizing industry wide data and regulatory requirements which may not reflect the company s historical or expected ultimate losses 
restricted cash and investments is classified as a current asset as the company settles and pays most workers compensation claims within one year from occurrence 
the company cannot access restricted cash and investments in the trust fund without the agreement of reliance 
see item risk management workers compensation program 
at december  and  approximately million and million were on deposit at camelback as restricted cash and investments 
at december  and  the company had working capital of million and million  respectively 
the significant growth in the company s working capital is a direct result of an increase in in restricted cash and investments of million from which was financed from cash flows from operations  and an increase in third party accounts receivable of approximately million  of which million was financed out of the company s operating cash flow and approximately million was financed from borrowings under the line 
assuming continued growth of the company s full service peo business and stand alone risk management workers compensation services program  the company anticipates that it will be required under its insurance arrangements with its insurers to set aside increasing amounts of funds for payment of claims and related administrative costs 
under bermuda law  camelback must maintain statutory capital and surplus in an amount equal to at least of the net premiums written through the company s fronting arrangements  provided that the percentage requirement is reduced to at such time as annualized premium volume reaches  under hawaii law  camelhead will be required to maintain statutory capital and surplus in an amount equal to at least of the net premiums written through the company s fronting arrangements 
camelhead s initial capital and surplus are expected to be million 
the laws of the jurisdictions of incorporation also regulate the circumstances under which these insurers may loan funds to their parent company 
in  the company paid to reliance approximately million of which million was ceded to the trust account at camelback for payment of claims 
the company also paid to legion in approximately million of which million in loss funds will be ceded to camelhead when such captive is authorized and activated 
between reliance and legion  the company used cash from operations of approximately million to fund its partially self insured workers compensation programs in in the future  these factors may limit the ability of the company to execute its planned growth strategy and may limit the ability of camelback and camelhead to transfer funds to its parent company whether via dividend or otherwise 
on august   the company entered into a three year million revolving credit facility for the purposes of acquisition financing  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the line was expanded to million on october  and to million on february  the revolving credit facility provides for various borrowing rate options including borrowing rates based on a fixed spread of basis points over the prime rate or basis points over the london interbank offered rate libor  as adjusted upward to reflect applicable reserve requirements 
the company pays a commitment fee of on the unused portion of the line 
total costs incurred in obtaining this facility and the expansion were approximately  and will be amortized over the life of the facility 
the line matures on august   and the maximum borrowing will decrease by million in each quarter beginning february  the principal loan covenants are as follows current ratio of at least to  total liabilities to net worth of not more than to  total funded debt to earnings before taxes  depreciation and amortization of not more than to the facility includes certain other covenants and is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
since the company obtained its line of credit in august  the million drawn under the line has been used almost exclusively for acquisition financing including million for the acquisition of leaseway  million for the acquisition of the mcclary trapp group  and approximately million to finance accounts receivable on such acquisitions 
at march   the company had borrowed approximately million under the credit facility  at that date  the company s borrowing limit was million as a consequence of the combination of the overall line of credit and borrowing covenants 
the company has financed its acquisitions through combinations of issuance of common stock  borrowing under its credit facility  working capital and assumption of acquired company obligations 
the company s revolving credit facility restricts its ability to consummate any acquisition for more than million or five times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the company received a waiver under the revolving credit facility to enter into its agreement to acquire the mcclary trapp group 
management believes that existing cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from ongoing operations  and cash available through its existing line of credit will satisfy the anticipated cash requirements of the company s current operations for the foreseeable future  however  the company s ability to continue funding its acquisition strategy is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing 
outlook issues and risks the company believes that future growth opportunities in revenues and profits remain available 
however  the following issues and risks  among others including those discussed elsewhere herein  should also be considered in evaluating its outlook 
management of rapid growth 
the company s success depends  in part  upon its ability to achieve growth and manage this growth effectively 
since its formation  the company has experienced rapid growth which has challenged the company s management  personnel  resources and systems 
as part of its business strategy  the company intends to pursue continued growth through its sales and marketing capabilities  acquisitions and marketing alliances 
although the company intends to expand its management  personnel resources and systems to manage future growth and to assimilate acquired operations  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or accelerate its growth in the future or manage this growth effectively 
failure to do so could materially adversely affect the company s business and financial performance 
because the company intends to focus in the short term on further integrating prior acquisitions into the company s operations  the company does not currently expect acquisition activity to be as extensive as in a substantial portion of the company s recent and anticipated growth is attributable to its risk management workers compensation services program 
the risks associated with rapid growth in this area include the potential for poor underwriting due to a lack of experience with new geographic markets and industries served  a shortage of experienced and trained personnel  and the need for sophisticated operating systems to help manage these risks 
the company recently converted its risk management information system to a new operating system to support this growth  there can be no assurances that this conversion will ultimately prove to be successful  or that other future changes in systems or procedures will be successfully completed 
to accommodate growth  the company is also relocating its phoenix operations to new offices in april  which move may result in certain disruptions 
any failure to successfully manage growth in the risk management workers compensation program could adversely affect the company s ability to underwrite profitable risks and efficiently resolve claims  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial performance 
adequacy of loss reserves 
under its present workers compensation arrangements  the company is responsible for the first   for certain transportation programs of each loss with no aggregate limit to the number of losses for which the company may be liable and under its partially self insured and self insured health insurance arrangements  the company is responsible for the first  or  per covered individual per year  depending upon the program 
the company s reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses under its workers compensation and health insurance programs are estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related loss adjustment expenses 
reserves are estimates based on industry data and historical experience  and include judgments of the effects that future economic and social forces are likely to have on the company s experience with the type of risk involved  circumstances surrounding individual claims and trends that may affect the probable number and nature of claims arising from losses not yet reported 
consequently  loss reserves are inherently uncertain and are subject to a number of highly variable and difficult to predict circumstances 
this uncertainty is compounded in the company s case by its rapid growth and limited experience 
for these reasons  there can be no assurance that the company s ultimate insurance liability will not materially exceed its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
if the company s reserves prove to be inadequate  the company will be required to increase reserves or corresponding loss payments with a corresponding reduction  which may be material  in the company s net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
loss and claims experience 
during the limited period of time the company has operated its risk management workers compensation programs  it believes that it has achieved a below average loss experience ratio due to its selective evaluation process  safety programs  active claims management  maintenance of its accidental death and dismemberment policy  and exclusion of category iv risks 
however  the company may not be able to maintain such a loss experience over a longer period of time 
future loss experience could increase due to weakened underwriting standards as a result of internal growth  the loss experience of acquired operations  increased competition in the company s risk management workers compensation business or other factors which may affect the company s standards  procedures or claims experience in the future 
an increase in the company s loss experience would decrease the company s net income and could materially adversely affect the company s business and financial performance 
the company provides stand alone risk management workers compensation coverage on either a guaranteed cost basis or a retrospective basis in which premiums are adjusted after the end of the policy term to reflect loss experience 
in a guaranteed cost arrangement  the company bears the risk of losses  which may be higher than anticipated 
while premiums are adjusted to reflect actual losses in a retrospective policy  which may reduce risk to the company  lower than anticipated losses on these policies may negatively affect the company because the company may have recorded a higher premium which would have resulted from the expected loss level 
state unemployment taxes are  in part  determined by the company s claims experience 
claims experience also greatly impacts the company s health insurance rates and claims cost from year to year 
should the company experience a large increase in claims activity for unemployment  workers compensation and or health care  then its costs in these areas would increase 
in such a case  the company may not be able to pass these higher costs to its clients and would therefore have difficulty competing with the peos with lower claims rates that may offer lower rates to clients 
tax code treatment 
the irs has formed a market segment study group to examine whether peos such as the company are for certain tax purposes the employers of worksite employees under the code 
if the irs were to determine that the company is not an employer under certain provisions of the code  it could materially adversely affect the company in several ways 
first  with respect to benefit plans  the tax qualified status of the company s k plans would be revoked  and the company s cafeteria and medical reimbursement plans may lose their favorable tax status 
the company cannot predict either the timing or the nature of any final decision that may be reached by the irs with respect to the market segment study group or the ultimate outcome of any such decision  nor can the company predict whether the treasury department will issue a policy statement with respect to its position on these issues or  if issued  whether such statement would be favorable or unfavorable to the company 
effective as of january   the company has implemented a new k retirement plan which involves both the client and the company as co sponsors of the plan and is intended to be a multiple employer plan under code section c 
the company believes that this multiple employer plan is less likely to be adversely affected by any irs determination that no employer relationship exists between the company and worksite employees 
while the company does sponsor some sole employer plans covering worksite employees which the company assumed in connection with other acquired peo operations and which could be adversely affected by any unfavorable irs determination  the company intends to convert the majority of the sole employer plans into one or more multiple employer plans  and the company believes that any unfavorable irs determination  if applied prospectively that is  applicable only to periods after such a determination is reached  would probably not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  if an adverse irs determination were applied retroactively to disqualify benefit plans  employees vested account balances under k plans would become taxable  an administrative employer such as the company would lose its tax deductions to the extent its matching contributions were not vested  a k plan s trust could become a taxable trust and the administrative employer could be subject to liability with respect to its failure to withhold applicable taxes and with respect to certain contributions and trust earnings 
in such event  the company also would face the risk of client dissatisfaction and potential claims by clients or worksite employees 
a determination by the irs that the company is not an employer under certain provisions of the code also could lead the irs to conclude that federal taxes were not paid by the proper party because such taxes must be paid by the employer 
this conclusion could lead to actions by the irs against clients of the company seeking direct payment of taxes  plus penalties and interest  even though the taxes were previously paid by the company 
in light of the irs market segment study group and the general uncertainty in this area  certain legislation has been drafted to clarify the employer status of peos in the context of the code and benefit plans 
however  there can be no assurance that such legislation will be proposed and adopted and even if it were adopted  the company may need to change aspects of its operations or programs to comply with any requirements which may ultimately be adopted 
in particular  the company may need to retain increased sole or shared control over worksite employees if the legislation is passed in its current form 
the attractiveness to clients of a full service peo arrangement depends in part upon the tax treatment of payments for particular services and products under the code for example  the opportunity of employees to pay for certain benefits under a cafeteria plan using pre tax dollars 
changes to the code  related irs regulations or other laws and regulations could adversely affect the company s business and financial performance 
credit risks 
as the employer of record for its worksite employees  the company is obligated to pay their wages  benefit costs and payroll taxes 
the company typically bills a client company for these amounts in advance of or at each payroll date  and reserves the right to terminate its agreement with the client  and thereby the company s liability for future payrolls to the client s worksite employees  if payment is not received within two days of the invoice date 
however  the rapid turnaround necessary to process and make payroll payments leaves the company vulnerable to client credit risks  some of which may not be identified prior to the time payroll payments are made 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to timely terminate any delinquent accounts or that its contractual termination rights will be judicially enforced 
in addition  the company has recently entered several market segments through acquisitions in which peos typically advance wages  benefit costs and payroll taxes to their clients 
the company intends to continue this practice despite the potentially greater credit risk posed by such practices 
also  in its stand alone risk management worker s compensation program  the company structures certain of its clients premium payments so that less than the full premium is billed periodically through the policy year  with the difference to be paid by the client on a deferred basis after the end of the policy year 
in each case  the company conducts a limited credit review before accepting new clients 
however  the nature of the company s business and pricing margins is such that a small number of client credit failures could have an adverse effect on its business and financial performance 
litigation 
the company has been named as defendants in several actions alleging violations of securities laws with respect to the accuracy of certain statements regarding company reserves and other disclosures made by the company and certain of its directors and officers 
these suits were filed shortly after significant drop in trading price of the shares of the company s common stock in march while the complaints do not specify damages  the company expects the requests to be substantial 
the company believes the claims are without merit  and intends to vigorously defend these actions 
however  the cost of defending these actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in future periods  and their ultimate resolution could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  publicity relating to the litigation could have a negative effect on the company s relationships with its current and prospective clients  employees and suppliers 
client relationships 
the company s subscriber agreements with its clients generally may be canceled upon days written notice of termination by either party 
while the company believes that it has experienced favorable client retention in the past  there can be no assurance that those relationships will continue or that historical rates of retention will continue to be achieved 
the short term nature of most customer agreements means that clients could terminate a substantial portion of the company s business upon short notice 
through recent acquisitions and internal growth  the percentage of company s clients in the transportation industry has increased 
while the company has targeted this industry  which it believes could benefit from company services and expertise  increased concentration in a single industry could make the company more subject to risks and trends of that industry 
also  certain aspects of the transportation industry may be subject to particular risks  such as the risk of property damage  injury and death from accidents inherent in the operation of a motor vehicle 
in addition  the company is providing driver leasing services  in which the company acts as sole employer  which may increase risk to the company as a result of the direct nature of the employment relationship 
dependence on one insurer 
the company believes that its risk management workers compensation services program has been and will continue to be an important competitive factor in its growth and profitability 
the company s risk management workers compensation services program is currently being conducted principally in coordination with one insurer  reliance 
the company s contract with reliance was last renewed june   and is subject to annual renewals and may  if certain conditions are not met by the company  be canceled by reliance on days notice 
there can be no assurance that upon expiration of the current term the company can renew the reliance program on commercially reasonable terms 
the company would be materially adversely affected by a termination of its arrangements with reliance if the company could not quickly make similar arrangements with another insurer 
in part to lessen its dependence upon reliance  the company is seeking to establish relationships with additional insurers  and has entered into an agreement with legion for certain company programs 
the company s ability to make similar arrangements with other insurers is limited  however  because other insurers generally require large segregated books of business in order to lessen the risk of adverse selection by the company and to maximize the economic potential of the arrangement for the insurer 
there can therefore be no assurance that the company will be able to significantly lessen its dependence on reliance in the near future 
uncertainty of extent of peo s liability  government regulation of peos 
the company s clients are regulated by numerous federal and state laws relating to labor  tax and employment matters 
generally  these laws prohibit race  age  sex  disability and religious discrimination  mandate safety regulations in the workplace  set minimum wage rates and regulate employee benefits 
because many of these laws were enacted prior to the development of non traditional employment relationships  such as peo services  many of these laws do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of non traditional employers such as the company  and there are many legal uncertainties about employee relationships created by peos  such as the extent of the peo s liability for violations of employment and discrimination laws 
the company may be subject to liability for violations of these or other laws even if it does not participate in such violations 
as a result  interpretive issues concerning the definition of the term employer in various federal laws have arisen pertaining to the employment relationship 
unfavorable resolution of these issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
compliance with these laws and regulations is time consuming and expensive 
the company s standard form of client service agreement establishes the contractual division of responsibilities between the company and its clients for various personnel management matters  including compliance with and liability under various governmental regulations 
however  because the company acts as a co employer  and in some instances acts as sole employer  the company may be subject to liability for violations of these or other laws despite these contractual provisions  even if it does not participate in such violations 
the circumstances in which the company acts as sole employer may expose the company to increased risk of such liabilities for an employee s actions 
the company has been sued in tort actions alleging responsibility for employee actions which it considers to be incidental to its business 
although it believes it has meritorious defenses  and maintains insurance and requires its clients to maintain insurance covering certain of such liabilities  there can be no assurances that the company will not be found to be liable for damages in any such suit  or that such liability would not have a materially adverse effect on the company 
although the client generally is required to indemnify the company for any liability attributable to the conduct of the client or employee  the company may not be able to collect on such a contractual indemnification claim and thus may be responsible for satisfying such liabilities 
in addition  employees of the client may be deemed to be agents of the company  subjecting the company to liability for the actions of such employees 
while many states do not explicitly regulate peos  states have passed laws that have licensing or registration requirements and at least three other states are considering such regulation 
such laws vary from state to state but generally provide for monitoring the fiscal responsibility of peos 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to satisfy licensing requirements or other applicable regulations of any particular state from time to time 
government regulation relating to workers compensation program 
as part of its risk management workers compensation programs  the company utilizes camelback and proposes to form camelhead as a wholly owned insurance company chartered in the state of hawaii 
insurance companies such as camelback and camelhead are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they are chartered  such laws and regulations generally are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than the interests of shareholders such as the company 
in general  insurance regulatory authorities have broad administrative authority over insurers domiciled in their respective jurisdictions  including authority over insurers capital and surplus levels  dividend payments  financial disclosure  reserve requirements  investment parameters and premium rates 
the jurisdictions also limit the ability of an insurer to transfer or loan statutory capital or surplus to its affiliates 
the regulation of camelhead and camelback could materially adversely affect the company s operations and results 
the company s risk management workers compensation services program is conducted via fronting arrangements with insurers 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic recently adopted a model act concerning fronting arrangements 
the model act requires reporting and prior approval of reinsurance transactions relating to these arrangements  and limits the amount of premiums that can be written under certain circumstances 
no determination can be made as to whether  or in what form  such act may ultimately be adopted by any state and  the company is therefore unable to predict whether the model act will affect its relationships with its insurers 
state regulation requires licensing of persons soliciting the sale of workers compensation insurance within that state 
in certain states  licenses are obtained by individual agents rather than a corporate entity 
the company  or one of its employees  is licensed in states  and has applied to be licensed in others 
although the company does not believe that its activities require such licenses because it solicits through other licensed entities  it is a risk that the company may be deemed to be making sales without a license in jurisdictions where it is not licensed  or that it would cease to maintain necessary licenses upon the departure of the employee who holds certain of such licenses 
acquisitions 
the company has grown substantially in recent years through the acquisition of other peo and similar companies 
a key component of the company s growth strategy is to continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to find attractive acquisition candidates at reasonable prices or  if it does  that other potential acquirers will not compete successfully with the company for these candidates 
also  there can be no assurance that the company will have or be able to obtain the resources necessary to successfully make future acquisitions or to integrate acquired operations into the company s 
because of the need to integrate acquisitions into the company s operations and the high volume of acquisitions in  the company does not currently expect acquisition activity to be as extensive as in any significant increase in the number of companies competing with the company to acquire peos would likely increase the cost of acquisitions and thereby limit the company s ability to grow profitably through acquisitions 
in addition  although the company attempts to thoroughly evaluate each acquisition candidate prior to an acquisition  there can also be no assurance that  once acquired  the company will be able to integrate the acquired company with the company s existing operations or achieve acceptable levels of revenues  profitability or productivity from the acquired company 
in addition  because the company generally accounts for its acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  prior periods are not restated to reflect those acquisitions 
therefore  the company s period to period results may vary significantly as a result of acquisitions 
health care reform proposals 
various proposals for national health care reform have been under discussion in recent years  including proposals to extend mandatory health insurance benefits to virtually all classes of employees 
any health care reform proposal which mandated health insurance benefits based on the number of employees employed by an entity could adversely affect peos such as the company  which for some purposes are deemed to employ all their clients employees 
in addition  certain reform proposals have sought to include medical costs for workers compensation in the reform package 
if such proposals increased the cost of medical payments or limited the company s ability to control its workers compensation costs  the company s ability to offer competitively priced workers compensation coverage to its clients could be adversely affected 
while the company is unable to predict whether or in what form health care reform will be enacted  aspects of such reform  if enacted  may have an adverse effect upon the company s medical and workers compensation insurance programs 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of may increase the company s risks relating to worksite employee health insurance programs because it extends the periods for which  and circumstances under which  an employer must allow an employee to participate in the employer s health plans 
such expanded availability may adversely affect the risk profile and claims experience of groups insured through the company  and thereby affect the company s premiums and the company s retained risks under its self insured programs 
tax liabilities 
as the employer of record for approximately  client companies and their  worksite employees  the company must account for and remit payroll  unemployment and other employment related taxes to numerous federal  state and local tax  labor and unemployment authorities  and is subject to substantial penalties for failure to do so 
from time to time  the company has received notices or challenges which may adversely affect its tax rates and payments 
the company has received a letter from the arizona department of economic security with respect to its unemployment tax rate for the year ended december  which  if determined adversely to the company  would result in an amount due of approximately  before interest and income tax effect 
in addition  the company has notices from the irs and various states alleging late payment of payroll taxes relating to an acquired company 
the penalties proposed to be assessed against the company total approximately  for post acquisition filings  and the penalties to be assessed against the predecessor company total approximately  for the period during which the company performed designated management services on behalf of the predecessor 
the company believes that it has defenses to these actions  and has objected vigorously to payment of such past taxes and penalties 
however  it is not possible to predict if the company will be successful in abating these taxes and penalties  or other claims which could arise in the future 
the company would be required to record these amounts as additional expense and liability if  at any time in the future  it appeared probable that the company would not prevail in these matters 
competition 
the market for many of the services provided by the company is highly fragmented  with over  peos currently competing in the united states 
many of these peos have limited operations with relatively few worksite employees  but the company believes at least one is larger than the company and several others approach the company s size 
the company also competes less directly with non peo companies whose offerings overlap with some of the company s peo services  including payroll processing firms  insurance companies  temporary personnel companies and human resource consulting firms 
in addition  the company expects that as the peo industry becomes better established  competition will increase because existing peo firms will likely consolidate into fewer and better competitors and well organized new entrants with greater resources than the company  including some of the non peo companies described above  will enter the peo market 
in the stand alone risk management workers compensation services area  the company considers state insurance funds and other private insurance carriers to be its primary competition 
the company recently has experienced the effects of an increase in competition  and a general softening of the market  in the workers compensation and benefits areas  which affects the company s growth and margins 
dependence upon certain officers and key employees 
the company is highly dependent upon the services of certain of its officers and key employees  particularly marvin d 
brody  its chief executive officer 
the loss of services of any of these individuals would have a material adverse effect upon the company 
the company does not have employment or non competition agreements with mr 
brody or employment agreements with certain other of these individuals 
volatility of securities prices 
the market price of the company s common stock has risen substantially since its initial public offering in august  and in that time has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
the market experienced particularly severe volatility in march factors such as the company s actual or anticipated operating results  acquisition activity  or other announcements by or about the company or its competitors have  and may continue to have  a significant effect on the market price of the company s securities 
in addition  the company s common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market  which market has experienced  and is likely to experience in the future  significant price and volume fluctuations which could adversely affect the price of the company s common stock without regard to the operating performance of the company 
authorization of preferred stock 
the company s articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the board of directors 
no shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding 
accordingly  under the articles of incorporation  the board of directors may  without shareholder approval  issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting  redemption or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock 
the issuance of any shares of preferred stock having rights superior to those of the common stock may result in a decrease of the value or market price of the common stock and could further be used by the board as a device to prevent a change in control of the company
