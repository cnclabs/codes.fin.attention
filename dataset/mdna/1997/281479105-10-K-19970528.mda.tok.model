there likewise is little direct economic risk to the company in importing books from the united kingdom as the company pays for the books in us dollars and is not directly subject to any currency fluctuations 
there is risk of physical loss of the books should an accident occur while the books are in transit  which could cause the company some economic loss due to lost sales should the supply of some titles run out in the event of a lost shipment
