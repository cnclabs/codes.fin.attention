business group graphs appear in this section 
carbon alloy net sales carbon alloy operating earnings loss net sales were up percent in the increase was largely attributable to an percent increase in shipments  particularly in carbon products 
shipments in were  tons compared to  tons in the group recorded an operating loss in due to unusual charges of  a work force reduction charge reduced results by  and an environmental remediation provision was  before the provisions  operating earnings of  were up percent from also impacting results was a  charge for signing bonuses associated with the new labor agreement at the coatesville  pennsylvania  facility  higher utility costs caused by severe winter weather and strike preparation costs

business group graphs appear in this section 
stainless net sales stainless operating earnings loss weak stainless steel market conditions led to a percent decrease in sales and an operating loss in the sales decline reflected customer inventory corrections during the first half of the year that reduced cold rolled shipments 
for the balance of  the dramatic rise in low priced stainless steel imports depressed base selling prices across all product lines 
a lower value shipment mix also contributed to the decrease 
shipments for were  tons  down slightly from shipments of  tons 
excluding lower value conversion tonnage  shipments were down percent from last year  primarily due to decreases in hot rolled and hot band stainless product shipments 
included in the operating loss were unusual charges totaling  the charges consisted of  for a work force reduction and  to write down idle assets and other equipment replaced as a result of capital improvements 
excluding the unusual charges for comparison purposes  operating earnings of  were down percent from the decline primarily reflected a significant deterioration in stainless steel market conditions as previously discussed 
in addition  earnings from the service center operations did not match their excellent results 
higher selling prices in led to a percent increase in sales compared to the increase was limited by customer inventory corrections during the second half of  which reduced shipments of cold rolled products 
shipments for were percent higher than shipments of  tons 
the sales improvement  coupled with productivity gains and strong results from the service center operations  translated to an percent earnings improvement from higher raw material costs partially offset the earnings improvement 
business outlook a return to profitability in is dependent on market conditions  especially selling prices in the stainless group 
the company will continue to focus on cost reduction initiatives and increased utilization of key facilities from the capital expenditure program 
as evidenced by the stainless group results in  vulnerability to stainless steel imports can have a devastating impact 
it is not expected that prices will rebound significantly from and the introduction of new production capacity by competitors will continue to exert pressure on selling prices over the next two or three years 
weak results are expected to continue if there is no improvement in the current market conditions 
dollars in thousands except per share amounts management s discussion and analysis the carbon alloy group should benefit from cost reduction initiatives and increased utilization of the smart system 
cost reduction initiatives include benefits from a work force reduction and productivity improvements 
competition is also expected to intensify as increased carbon plate capacity could soften prices in from the smart system located in conshohocken  pennsylvania  more than grades of smart carbon  alloy and stainless plate have been released for order entry  in sizes that represent the core of the wide  light gauge product mix 
smart coil production has exceeded  tons per week 
the installation of the wide anneal and pickle line at the massillon  ohio  facility was completed during the fourth quarter and commissioning is under way 
the challenge in is to increase utilization and integration of these new facilities 
in particular  marketing efforts for stainless hot rolled products will be a key factor for the year

financing activity generated  proceeds from the issuance of the notes discussed in the capital structure section were offset by net repayments of  and dividend payments of  investing activity required  primarily for capital expenditures of  improving cash flows from operating activity in are largely dependent on the earnings factors identified in the business outlook section 
another factor that will contribute to improved cash flows in is reduced capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for are expected to decrease to approximately  the combination of these cash flows and requirements should result in a capital structure similar to year end based on year end conditions  additional borrowings were limited to approximately  under the committed line of credit covenant

as discussed in note  a  environmental remediation provision was recorded in the timing of the estimated payments will not be determined until final resolution of the related administrative and judicial proceedings 
the company s exposure to remediation costs at these sites depends on several factors discussed in note based on information currently available  management does not anticipate that its financial position will be materially affected by additional environmental remediation costs  although quarterly or annual operating results could be materially affected by future developments
