part i item business a general overview staar surgical company staar or the company is a publicly traded nasdaq symbol staa developer  manufacturer and global distributor of medical devices used in minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery 
the company s products are designed to improve the quality of patient outcomes  minimize patient risk and discomfort  and simplify ophthalmic surgical procedures for surgeons and patients 
the company s primary products are its foldable intraocular lenses iols  its wick style glaucoma implant the glaucoma wick  its implantable contact lens icl  and its staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution 
the company s foldable iols are used as replacements for the natural lens after its removal in cataract surgery 
the ophthalmic surgeon can implant the foldable iol through an incision significantly smaller than that used to insert hard iols 
this provides numerous patient benefits including reduced risk of infection  decreased post operative pain and discomfort  and shorter hospitalization and recovery time 
the glaucoma wick is an innovative ocular device developed to provide a more effective and longer term solution for glaucoma  a leading cause of blindness worldwide 
the icl is an ocular implant designed to correct refractive disorders  such as myopia near sightedness and hyperopia far sightedness 
staarvisc tm is a viscoelastic solution used during iol and icl surgery 
the company markets its iols  which accounted for of its revenues in  both domestically and in numerous foreign countries 
the company markets the glaucoma wick  which the company introduced in late  and its icls and staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution  which the company introduced in late  on a limited basis in selected foreign countries 
development of business over past five years and relevant prior events the company was incorporated in california in as a successor to a partnership for the purpose of developing  producing  and marketing iols and other products for minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery 
the company was reincorporated in delaware in april in and the company s operations consisted mainly of research and development and preliminary marketing and capital raising activities

see licenses and distribution rights and products in item b financial information about industry segments through the company operated primarily within the cataract medical device segment of the overall ophthalmic market 
information relating to the company s financial condition for the fiscal years ended january   december  and december  is set forth below in item financial statements and supplementary data 
in late the company introduced the glaucoma wick  and in late the company introduced the icl and staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution  for sale in selected foreign countries 
c narrative description of business background the human eye is a specialized sensory organ capable of light reception and able to receive visual images that are transmitted to the visual center in the brain 
the main parts of the eye are the cornea  the iris  the lens  the retina  and the trabecular meshwork 
the cornea is typically a spherically shaped window in the front of the eye through which light passes 
the iris is a muscular curtain located behind the cornea which opens and closes to regulate the amount of light entering the eye through the pupil  an opening at the center of the iris 
the lens is a clear structure located behind the iris which changes shape to better focus the light to the retina  located in the back of the eye 
the retina is a layer of nerve tissue consisting of millions of light receptors called rods and cones  which receive the light image and transmit it to the brain via the optic nerve 
the anterior chamber of the eye  located in front of the iris  is filled with a watery fluid called the aqueous humour  while the portion of the eye behind the iris is filled with a jelly like material called the vitreous humour 
the trabecular meshwork  a drainage channel located between the cornea and the surrounding white portion of the eye  maintains a low pressure in the anterior chamber of the eye by draining excess aqueous humour 
there are a number of ocular diseases including cataracts and glaucoma and common visual refractive disorders such as myopia  hyperopia and astigmatism 
cataracts are an irreversible and progressive ophthalmic condition wherein the eye s natural lens loses its usual transparency and becomes opaque 
glaucoma results from the build up of excessive intraocular pressure  primarily due to poor drainage of the aqueous humor 
the increase in pressure slowly and progressively damages the optic disc  resulting in a gradual loss of vision 
myopia and hyperopia are caused by an anatomical imbalance between the shape of the eye and the resulting distance between the cornea and the retina 
astigmatism is caused by irregularities in the smoothness and curvature of the cornea  causing improper focusing of the incoming light on the retina and consequential blurring of vision 
markets the market for ophthalmic products is a large and dynamic segment of the healthcare industry 
the major factors influencing this market are the aging worldwide population  significant technological medical advancements which have created cost effective treatments and therapies  the evolution toward managed care and the growing importance of international markets 
the company s products serve the following segments of the ophthalmic market cataract lenses 
cataracts occur in varying degrees in approximately one half of americans between the ages of and  and approximately of those over the age of approximately to of cataract patients have pre existing astigmatism 
industry sources estimate that approximately million iols were implanted in the united states in  generating approximately million in sales 
the company believes approximately million iols were implanted outside the united states during not including china and russia  for which no reliable data exists  generating an additional million of sales 
the company believes that approximately of the domestic market for iols in was held by foldable iols  compared to approximately in  and that approximately to of the international market share is presently held by foldable iols 
the company believes the share of the worldwide market held by foldable iols will continue to increase by virtue of the benefits of foldable iols over hard iols 
glaucoma treatments 
this market encompasses drug therapies as well as traditional and laser surgical procedures for use in mitigating the effects of glaucoma 
there is no known cure for glaucoma  the most commonly prescribed glaucoma drugs either inhibit the build up of intraocular fluid or promote increased drainage  in either case reducing intraocular pressure and eye damage 
traditional surgical procedures for glaucoma ie  trabeculectomies and laser surgical procedures for glaucoma ie  trabeculoplasties remove a portion of the trabecular meshwork to create a channel for fluid to drain from the eye 
the selection of drug treatment over a trabeculectomy or trabeculoplasty is  in part  dependent upon the stage of the disease and the prevailing glaucoma treatment used in the country in which the treatment is given 
the company believes that glaucoma currently afflicts approximately three million persons in the united states  and that the number of international cases exceeds that of the united states 
the worldwide market for glaucoma drugs is approximately million  including approximately million from the sale of a single glaucoma drug 
it is estimated that  trabeculectomies and  laser trabeculoplasties were performed in the united states alone in  representing total expenditures of approximately million 
the company believes glaucoma surgery is more prevalent than glaucoma drug therapy in certain foreign countries due to cost and other considerations 
refractive vision correction 
the refractive vision correction market includes corrective eyewear such as eyeglasses and external contact lenses and traditional and laser surgical procedures 
approximately of the world s population is afflicted with common refractive vision disorders such as myopia  hyperopia and astigmatism  and approximately million people within the united states currently use some form of eyewear to correct for these disorders 
in  the vision correction market in the united states was approximately billion 
this market includes corrective eyeglasses  external contact lenses and various surgical procedures such as radial keratotomy rk  a conventional surgical technique  and photorefractive keratectomy prk  a surgical technique performed with the use of a laser 
it is estimated that over one million rk procedures have been performed in the united states  most of which have occurred since in   rk procedures were performed  at an average cost of  per procedure 
surgeons have used prk  a more recently developed refractive surgery technique  in an estimated  procedures to date worldwide  with a limited number occurring in the united states  where the procedure was approved in prk is expected to gain market share from rk 
industry sources estimate that the number of prk procedures in the united states could reach  in  representing a potential market of million 
approximately seven million people in the united states are afflicted with severe cases of myopia and hyperopia of greater than seven diopters which are not currently addressed by existing conventional or laser surgical procedures and frequently can be only partially corrected with eyeglasses and external contact lenses 
viscoelastic solution products 
the viscoelastic solution market relates to gel like substances used during iol surgeries to maintain the space and shape of the eye  to act as a buffer against cell damage and to otherwise act as a lubricant for minimally invasive eye surgery 
industry studies indicate that approximately million units of viscoelastic solution were sold within the united states in  generating approximately million in sales 
management believes the international market for viscoelastic solution is at least the size of the domestic market for this product 
strategy the company s strategy is to increase its share of the worldwide market for ophthalmic products through the development and marketing of innovative next generation products and technologies which utilize minimally invasive surgical procedures 
the key elements of this strategy are to i develop products that deliver distinct clinical and economic benefits to patients and surgeons  ii maintain a leading technological role in the industry  and iii expand markets worldwide 
products the company develops  manufactures and globally distributes medical devices used in minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery 
the company s products are designed to i improve patient outcomes  ii minimize patient risk and discomfort  and iii simplify ophthalmic procedures for the surgeon and patient 
the company s principal customers are ophthalmologists  surgical centers  hospitals  managed care providers  health maintenance organizations and group purchasing organizations 
intraocular lenses iols and related cataract products 
the company s principal products are its foldable iols for use in minimally invasive cataract surgical procedures 
the company s iols can be folded or otherwise deformed  and therefore can be implanted into the eye through an incision less than mm significantly smaller than the incision needed to insert hard iols approximately mm to mm 
once inserted  the company s iol unfolds naturally into the capsular bag which previously held the cataractous lens 
the primary advantages of using minimally invasive surgical procedures are 
fewer surgical complications 
a smaller incision minimizes eye trauma and the potential for infection 
in addition  the company s foldable iol can typically be implanted under topical anesthesia  thereby avoiding complications associated with the administration of local anesthesia 

reduced level of surgically induced astigmatism 
the ability to eliminate sutures as a result of the smaller incision leads to a reduction in the incidence of surgically induced astigmatism caused by uneven healing of the surgical wound 

faster recovery of vision 
patients can typically recover their best vision the same day the procedure is performed  as opposed to thirty to forty five days following surgery in the case of hard iols 

enhanced benefits to surgeons 
the use of foldable iols enables ophthalmologists to more quickly perform surgical procedures at lower cost  and with greater ease and consistently higher quality outcomes 
the company s foldable iols come in two differently configured styles  the advanced single piece elastic tm model  and the elastimide tm model based upon the tradit ional three piece design 
the selection of one model over the other is primarily based upon the preference of the ophthalmologist  although the company believes more experienced ophthalmologists prefer the single piece elastic tm model 
sales of foldable iols accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues for each of its through fiscal years and of total revenues for its fiscal year 
the company believes the unique features of its foldable iols afford a number of competitive advantages compared to other foldable iols such as ease of implantation  better patient outcomes  and minimization of cell growth and resulting capsular haze 
the company has developed  and currently markets in certain foreign countries  a toric version of its elastic tm iol  which is specifically designed for patients with pre existing astigmatism 
the company is the only foldable iol manufacturer to offer a product for astigmatism 
the company has implanted a limited number of its toric iols in patients within the united states for clinical study purposes pursuant to an investigational device exemption ide granted by the fda in november the company has completed phase iii clinical studies for the toric iol  and anticipates it will apply for fda pre market approval to market this product in the united states in mid no assurance can be given that this time schedule can be met  or that fda pre market approval for this product will be obtained 
as part of its approach to providing a complete line of complementary products for use in minimally invasive cataract surgery  the company also markets several styles of lens injectors and sterile cartridges used to insert iols  a phacoemulsification machine used to remove the cataractous lens  and several styles of disposable and reusable surgical packs and ultrasonic cutting tips used with the company s phacoemulsification machine 
glaucoma wick and glaucoma shunt 
the glaucoma wick is a medical device surgically implanted into the eye to reduce intraocular pressure iop 
it is made of biocompatible material which  through its porosity and hydrophilic properties  promotes drainage of excess eye fluid 
the glaucoma wick is specifically designed for patients suffering from open angled glaucoma  which is the most prevalent type of glaucoma 
in contrast to trabeculectomies and trabeculoplasties  implantation of the glaucoma wick does not require penetration of the anterior chamber of the eye 
instead  a small flap of the outer eye tissue is folded back  the glaucoma wick is placed above the trabecular meshwork and the outer flap is refolded into place 
the glaucoma wick swells to approximately five to ten times its original size and is absorbed within one to six months after implantation  creating a new drainage pathway 
the twenty to forty minute surgical procedure to implant the glaucoma wick is performed under local or topical anesthesia  typically on an outpatient basis 
management believes the hydrophilic properties of the glaucoma wick and the minimally invasive nature of the surgery offer several advantages over existing surgical procedures including i greater efficacy  ii a longer term solution  iii reduced risk of surgical complications  and iv cost effectiveness 
the company believes the glaucoma wick is an attractive product for i managed care and health maintenance organizations and group purchasing organizations who desire to control their costs and at the same time provide their customers with a higher standard of health care  ii less developed countries which lack the resources and infrastructure to provide continuous treatments  and iii ophthalmic surgeons who have traditionally referred their patients to glaucoma specialists 
adoption by ophthalmic surgeons  however  will be dependent upon the rate at which they learn the advanced surgical skills necessary to perform the implant or at which instrumentation is developed to simplify the procedure 
the company will promote this product by educating surgeons through its highly trained technical sales force 
see uncertainties and risk factors risks relating to commercialization of new products 
in item the company introduced the glaucoma wick in late for commercial sale on a limited basis in south africa and selected countries in europe and south america 
the company intends to apply to the fda in mid for an ide leading to a k clearance to commercially market this product within the united states 
no assurance can be given as to when or if fda k clearance for this product will be obtained 
see uncertainties and risk factors government regulation and uncertainty of product approval in item since the company has marketed its molteno tm style glaucoma shunt  a medical device implanted at the latest stages of glaucoma  after conventional treatments have been performed and failed and vision is effectively lost 
the glaucoma shunt is designed to relieve pain and prevent the removal of the eye 
the company will continue to supply this product for patients in the last stages of glaucoma 
implantable contact lenses icls 
icls are medical devices implanted in the eye to permanently correct common refractive vision disorders including myopia  hyperopia and potentially astigmatism 
the icl is initially targeted to persons afflicted with severe hyperopia and myopia defined as more than seven diopters which are not currently being addressed through current traditional or laser surgical procedures and frequently can be only partially corrected with eyeglasses or external contact lenses 
these individuals  who suffer significant vision impairment  are the most likely to seek surgical alternatives 
the company also believes the icl will be an attractive alternative for individuals afflicted with moderate cases of myopia and hyperopia 
the company s icl is folded and implanted into the eye behind the iris and in front of the normal lens using minimally invasive surgical techniques similar to implanting an iol during cataract surgery  except that the human lens is not removed 
the five to twenty minute surgical procedure to implant the icl is typically performed with topical anesthesia on an outpatient basis 
management believes the use of an icl affords a number of advantages over existing refractive surgical procedures  such as rk and prk  including the following i potentially corrects all levels of myopia and hyperopia  ii may provide superior predictability of results  iii in most cases allows for reversibility  which is precluded by existing surgical procedures  iv enables faster recovery of vision and rehabilitation  and v produces potentially superior refractive results 
the company commenced commercial sales of icls in late on a limited basis in south africa  china  and selected countries in europe and south america 
in february   the fda granted the company an ide to commence clinical studies consisting of three distinct phases within the united states 
the first phase of the ide permits the company to implant ten icls for myopia and ten icls for hyperopia 
no assurance can be given as to when or if the fda will grant approval to expand the study to the second or third phase or as to when or if the fda will grant pre market approval for the icl 
see uncertainties and risk factors government regulation and uncertainty of product approval in item viscoelastic solution products 
viscoelastic solution is a gel like substance which can be used during iol and icl surgery to assist the ophthalmic surgeon in establishing and maintaining the space and shape of the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye 
it also acts as a resilient buffer to protect against inadvertent damage to the vital endothelial cells in the eye 
viscoelastic solution is also effective as a lubricant for injection of foldable iols and icls using minimally invasive surgical procedures 
the company believes it can effectively market its staarvisc tm hyaluronic acid based viscoelastic solution in conjunction with its foldable iol and icl products 
the company introduced its staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution in late for commercial sale on a limited basis in canada and selected countries in europe and south america 
the only significant pending action necessary to obtain fda pre market approval to commercially market staarvisc tm within the united states is satisfaction of fda regulations pertaining to good manufacturing practices 
the company intends to arrange an fda inspection of its staarvisc tm manufacturing facilities in mid in order to satisfy this final requirement 
see uncertainties and risk factors government regulation and uncertainty of product approval in item research and development the company is focused on furthering technological advancements in the ophthalmic products industry through continuous development and innovation of ophthalmic products and materials  and related surgical techniques to promote these products 
see business strategy above 
the company maintains an active internal research and development program comprised of over employees 
over the past year  research and development efforts have been primarily focused on i developing the company s icls  glaucoma wick and toric iol  ii improving insertion and delivery systems for the company s foldable iols  and iii generally improving the manufacturing systems and procedures for all products to reduce manufacturing costs 
research and development expenses amounted to approximately   and  for the company s  and fiscal years  respectively 
marketing  selling and distribution the company maintains a highly trained sales force that works closely with its customers primarily surgeons and other health care providers to educate them on the benefits of its iols as well as the skills and techniques needed to perform minimally invasive surgical procedures 
the company supplements its direct sales efforts through advertising in medical and trade journals and by sponsoring surgical procedure courses  seminars and technical presentations chaired by leading ophthalmologists 
the company s products are sold domestically through a network of independent regional manufacturers representatives and their territorial representatives 
international sales are primarily conducted through the company s subsidiaries that sell through independent sales representatives engaged on a basis similar to that of sales representatives within the united states 
in countries where the company s subsidiaries do not have a direct presence  sales are conducted through country or area medical distributors 
competition competition in the medical device field is intense and characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change 
development by competitors of new or improved products  processes or technologies may make the company s products obsolete or less competitive 
the company will be required to devote continued efforts and significant financial resources to enhance its existing products and or develop new products for the ophthalmic industry 
see uncertainties and risk factors highly competitive industry  rapid technological change in item the company believes its primary competition for foldable iols includes allergan medical optics amo  a subsidiary of allergan  inc allergan  chiron vision corporation chiron  a subsidiary of chiron corporation  and alcon surgical  inc alcon  a subsidiary of alcon laboratories  inc  all of whom are licensees of the company s foldable technology 
significant competitors in the hard iol market are believed to include chiron  amo  pharmacia upjohn  inc pharmacia upjohn  alcon  storz ophthalmics  inc 
storz  a subsidiary of american home products  and mentor corporation 
the company s primary competition for glaucoma products is from pharmaceutical companies 
the company believes merck company  inc  alcon  allergan  and storz are the largest providers of glaucoma drugs within the united states  and ciba vision corporation  a subsidiary of ciba geigy corporation  pharmacia upjohn and lederle laboratories  a subsidiary of american home products  are the largest internationally 
the portion of this market held by glaucoma devices is insignificant at present 
the company will face significant competition for its icls generally from manufacturers and distributors of corrective eyeglasses and external contact lenses  and particularly from providers of conventional and laser surgical procedures 
the company believes its primary competitors for laser surgical procedures are summit technology  inc summit  visx  incorporated visx  escalon medical  inc  sunrise medical  chiron and nidek co  ltd 
summit s and visx s excimer lasers for prk are the only products which have received pre market approval from the fda for sale within the united states 
keravision  inc is developing the corneal ring 
pharmacia upjohn  which distributes and manufactures a hyaluronic based viscoelastic solution known as healon tm  is the primary competitor for this product 
other companies such as amo  chiron  alcon and storz also sell viscoelastic type products 
manufacturing and suppliers the company principally manufactures its iols at its facilities located in california  and its glaucoma wick  icls and staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution at its facilities located in switzerland 
many components of the company s products are purchased to its specifications from suppliers or subcontractors 
most of these components are standard parts available from multiple sources at competitive prices 
the company presently has one supplier of silicone  the principal raw material for its lenses  although it can purchase this raw material from several distributors 
similarly  certain items used by the company in its disposable surgical packs are provided by a single supplier 
the company s phaco xl tm phacoemulsification machine is being manufactured for the company by unaffiliated third parties 
if any of these supply sources becomes unavailable  the company believes that it would be able to secure alternate supply sources within a short period of time and with minimal or no disruption 
licenses and distribution rights the company has granted licenses to certain of its patents  products  trade secrets and technology  including its foldable technology  to other companies in the iol industry 
the licenses under the patents extend for the life of the patents 
the licensees include optical radiation corporation orc  chiron  amo  alcon and canon staar  a joint venture owned equally by the company and canon  inc and canon sales co  inc 
included in some of the licenses granted are licenses to certain of the company s foldable patents which were granted on an exclusive basis to canon staar for japan only  on a non exclusive basis to alcon  orc  chiron and canon staar with respect to the world other than japan  and on a co exclusive basis to amo 
at the time these licenses were granted  the company received substantial pre payments of royalties on all but one of the licenses 
the pre payment period on many of these licenses have since lapsed or will lapse in the near future 
the company s business strategy is not dependent upon realizing royalties from these licenses in the future 
in view of the number of licenses granted to its competitors  the company is often subject to disputes regarding the requirements of the licenses 
the company and its licensee  allergan  are currently in litigation with pharmacia upjohn for infringement of the mazzocco patent 
the company is also in litigation with chiron on the basis of a dispute regarding an indemnification clause set forth in an agreement between the company and chiron and the payment of royalties 
the impact of an adverse decision in either case is unknown at this time

in item regulatory requirements the company s products are subject to regulatory approval or clearance in both the united states and in foreign countries 
the following discussion outlines the various kinds of reviews to which the company s products or facilities may be subject 
clinical regulatory requirements within the united states 
most of the company s products are subject to regulation as medical devices by the fda  requiring fda approval or clearance before they can be sold within the united states  and mandating continuous compliance of the company s manufacturing facilities and distribution procedures with fda regulations  including good manufacturing practices 
initial approval or clearance of medical devices for sale is subject to differing levels or types of fda review and evaluation depending on the classification of the device under the food  drug and cosmetic act fd c act and whether the use of the medical device can be demonstrated to be substantially equivalent to a directly related medical device in commerce prior to may the month and year of enactment of the fd c act 
pursuant to the fd c act  medical devices are classified as either class i  class ii or class iii devices 
if classified as a class i device  the medical device will be subject only to general controls which are applicable to all devices 
such controls include regulations regarding fda inspections of facilities  good manufacturing practices  labeling  maintenance of records and filings with the fda 
if classified as a class ii device  the medical device must also meet general performance standards established by the fda 
if classified as a class iii device  the applicant must present sufficient data derived through clinical studies demonstrating the product s safety  reliability and effectiveness 
fda approval for a class iii device such as an iol or icl implant begins with the submission of an application for an investigational device exemption or ide which  if granted  will permit the implantation of a limited number of iols or icls typically less than on a clinical study basis 
based upon the results from the initial core population  the fda will then allow an additional core study to be performed  typically to implants 
the complete clinical results will then be reviewed by an fda advisory panel of outside experts 
if the advisory panel approves the product based upon the results  the fda will then generally grant pre market approval assuming satisfaction of its other requirements 
the grant of an ide  the performance of clinical studies  the submission of an application for pre market approval  and advisory panel approval  may take three to ten years depending  in part  upon the complexity of the medical device 
a medical device that is substantially equivalent to a directly related medical device previously in commerce may be eligible for abbreviated fda pre market notification k review process 
the review period and fda determination as to substantial equivalence should be made within days of submission of a k application  unless additional material  information or clarification is requested or required by the fda 
as a practical matter  the review process and fda determination often take significantly longer than days depending  in part  upon the complexity of the medical device 
fda k clearance is a grandfather process 
as such  fda clearance does not imply that the safety  reliability and effectiveness of the medical device has been approved or validated by the fda  but merely means that the medical device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared commercially related medical device 
the company s iols  icls  lens injectors  glaucoma wick  glaucoma shunt  and staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution are class iii devices  and its phacoemulsification equipment  ultrasonic cutting tips and surgical packs are class ii devices 
the company has received fda pre market approval for its iols other than its toric version  and fda k clearance for its glaucoma shunt  phacoemulsification equipment  lens injectors  ultrasonic cutting tips and surgical packs 
the company is presently conducting clinical studies under an ide for its toric iol 
the company has received an ide to commence limited clinical studies for its icls 
the only significant pending requirement for the company to obtain pre market approval of its staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution is the inspection and approval by the fda of the company s manufacturing facilities for good manufacturing practices 
the company intends to apply to the fda in mid for k clearance for its glaucoma wick 
the company is also subject to mandatory medical device reporting mdr regulations which obligate the company to provide information to the fda on injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of a product or in connection with certain product failures which could cause injury clinical regulatory requirements in foreign countries 
there is a wide variation in the approval or clearance requirements necessary to market products in foreign countries 
the requirements range from virtually no requirements to a level comparable to or even greater than those of the fda 
for example  many countries in south america have minimal regulatory requirements  while many developed countries  such as japan and germany  have conditions at least as stringent as those of the fda 
fda acceptance is not always a substitute for foreign government approval or clearance 
the member countries of the european economic union the union currently permit  and by will require  all medical products sold within their borders to carry a ce marking 
the ce marking denotes that the applicable medical device has been found to be in compliance with guidelines concerning manufacturing and quality control  technical specifications and biological chemical and clinical safety

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company develops  manufactures and globally distributes medical devices used in minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery 
the company s primary products are its foldable iols  its glaucoma wick  its icls and its staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution 
the company markets its iols  which accounted for of its revenues in  both domestically and in numerous foreign countries 
the company markets the glaucoma wick  which the company introduced in late  and its icls and staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution  which the company introduced in late  on a limited basis in selected foreign countries 
the company has marketed its foldable iols internationally since and  in september  following a lengthy period of clinical studies  received fda pre market approval to fully market the company s elastic tm and elastimide tm foldable iol models within the united states 
since that time  the company s total revenues increased from million in its fiscal year to million in its fiscal year  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
the company also receives royalty income with respect to certain of its licensed technologies  although it does not consider the royalty income to be material to its current or prospective financial condition 
international revenues represented of total revenues for the fiscal year  up from for the fiscal year 
the mix of the company s revenues and profits  on both a product and geographic basis  will be affected by the continued introduction and acceptance of the company s glaucoma wick  icls and staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution in various markets worldwide  including the united states 
sales of the company s glaucoma wick and icls will be limited to the international market until such products receive united states fda approval 
the company s long term objective is to increase international revenues to account for one half of total revenue 
the company s principal customers are ophthalmologists  surgical centers  hospitals  managed care providers  health maintenance organizations and group purchasing organizations 
the company generally supplies a quantity of foldable iols with different specifications to domestic customers on a consignment basis and recognizes sales when an ophthalmic surgeon implants the consigned foldable iol 
however  sales to foreign distributors are recognized upon shipment 
the company typically does not have any backlog of orders  and has minimal product returns 
ophthalmic surgeons and other providers of foldable iols are generally eligible to receive reimbursements from government or private third party payors  such as medicare  subject to certain limitations and pricing pressures 
the company does not expect that icls will be eligible for  and there can be no assurance that the glaucoma wick will be eligible for  reimbursement by government or private third party payors 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the company s income statement for the period indicated and the percentage increase or decrease in such items over the prior period 
percentage of total revenues percentage change fiscal fiscal year ended year january  december  december  vs vs total revenues cost of sales gross profit costs and expenses general and administrative marketing and selling research and development total costs and expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended january  were million  representing a increase over million in revenues for the prior year ended december  the increase in revenues was principally attributable to the continued growth in unit sales of the company s primary products  its foldable iols  in both the domestic and international markets  partially offset by certain domestic price decreases due to competitive pressures 
increases in unit volume are attributable  in significant part  to the continuing conversion of the cataract market to foldable iols according to industry statistics  approximately of all cataract surgeries performed in the united states in used foldable iols as compared to in 
revenues from international sales increased to of total revenues for the year ended january   as compared to for the prior fiscal year  reflecting the company s increased efforts to develop international markets  as well as the conversion of these markets to foldable iols 
also included in revenues for the year ended january  are international sales of  resulting from the commercial introduction in selected foreign markets of the company s glaucoma wick at the end of and its icls and staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution at the end of revenues from royalties also increased from  for to million for cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues for the year ended january  declined slightly to of revenues as compared for the prior year 
the principal reasons for this slight decline were increased operating efficiencies and economies of scale from increased sales volume 
these savings were offset by price decreases resulting from competitive pressures and a product mix change due to an increased demand for the elastimide tm iol  which is relatively more expensive to manufacture 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense for the year ended january  was million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues  for the prior year 
the decline in general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was attributable to the significant growth in overall revenues permitting greater absorption of general and administrative costs 
the increase in general and administrative expense in dollar terms was attributable to additional administrative infrastructure expenditures required to support the increase in revenues 
marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expense for the year ended january  was million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues  for the prior year 
the decline in marketing and selling expense as a percentage of revenues was attributable to the significant growth in overall revenues permitting greater absorption of fixed marketing and selling ie  non commission costs 
the increase in marketing and selling expense in dollar terms was principally attributable to greater commissions paid arising from increased sales revenues 
research and development 
research and development expense for the year ended january  was million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues  for the prior year 
this increase was attributable to the company s continued investment in developing new products  manufacturing systems and distribution systems  cost reduction projects for manufacturing  and increased costs incurred conducting clinical studies in the united states 
other income  net 
other income for the year ended january  was  or of revenues  as compared to  or of revenues  for the prior year 
the primary reasons for this decrease were increased interest expenses  losses in translating foreign currency  and a decline in deferred revenue arising from the sale of a license to the canon staar joint venture 
the deferred revenue reported in is the last portion of total deferred revenue realized with respect to the canon staar license 
income tax provision benefit 
income taxes increased to a provision of million for the year ended january  from a benefit of  for the year ended december  is the first year the company has reported an income tax provision without having offsets related to net operating loss carryforwards 
however  the company will not pay any significant federal income taxes until it fully utilizes the remaining million of net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
the company fully utilized its net operating loss carryforwards for state taxes in the company has recorded a deferred tax asset of million as of january  management believes expected future income levels should result in full recognition of the deferred tax asset 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  were million  which was greater than the million in revenues for the prior year ended december  the increase in sales revenues was attributable to a combination of interrelated factors  including i increased domestic demand for the company s elastimide tm  and  to a lesser degree  elastic tm foldable iols due to the introduction of ultraviolet versions of these products in april  ii increased international demand for the company s iols as a result of the company s continued investment in its foreign distribution channels international revenue increased to of total company revenue for  as compared to in  and iii the continuing conversion of both the domestic and international markets from hard iols to foldable iols according to industry statistics  of the overall domestic iol market at the end of was held by foldable iols  and  according to management estimates  of the overall international iol market at the end of was held by foldable iols 
gains in volume were partially offset by certain domestic price decreases resulting from pressures from managed care providers 
revenues from royalties were  in compared to million in cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to of revenues for the year ended december  compared to of revenues for the year ended december  the principal reasons for this increase were i lower pricing from certain managed care contract sales  ii inefficiencies associated with the resumption of manufacturing of ultraviolet versions of the company s elastic tm and elastimide tm iols following fda pre market approval in the second quarter of  iii increased sales of the elastimide tm iol  which is more costly to manufacture because of its design  and iv increased costs associated with the start up of manufacturing of new products in switzerland 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased to of revenues million for the year ended december  from of revenues million for the year ended december  this percentage decrease resulted from management s continued efforts to control general and administrative expenses  combined with the increase in revenues 
the increase in actual general and administrative expense was attributable to the start up of the company s operations in switzerland 
marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expense decreased to of revenues million for the year ended december  from of revenues million for the year ended december  the increase in actual marketing and selling expense was attributable to i higher marketing and selling expenses associated with the build up of direct distribution channels in australia  south africa  france and switzerland which translated into a significant portion of increased international revenues for  and ii increased costs associated with the market introduction of the new glaucoma wick and preparation for the market introduction of the icl in selected foreign countries 
this increase in expenses was partially offset by reduced domestic commission expenses attributable to lower pricing 
research and development 
research and development expense decreased to of revenues million for the year ended december  from of revenues million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in actual expense was the continued investment in developing new products  manufacturing systems and distribution systems  and cost reduction projects for manufacturing 
other income  net 
other income decreased to of revenues  for the year ended december  from of revenues  for the year ended december  the primary reason for this decrease was reduced earnings reported by the company s joint venture with canon staar and increased interest expense attributable to money borrowed through staar surgical ag to set up the company s swiss manufacturing facility and increased borrowings by the company under its line of credit 
subsequent to the year end the company refinanced and increased its domestic line of credit facility with a different lender 
the company obtained a lower interest rate under the refinancing  which should result in lower interest expense for comparable future borrowings 
income tax provision benefit 
as a result of increased operating profits  the company increased its deferred tax asset to million as of december   up from million as of december  this resulted in an income tax benefit of   income tax provision  exclusive of net operating loss benefit  offset by  recognition of deferred tax asset in  compared to million  income tax provision  exclusive of net operating loss benefit  offset by million recognition of deferred tax asset in as a result of the company s positive operating results for each of the three years ended december   the company determined that deferred tax assets of approximately million and million should be recognized as of december  and december   respectively 
these amounts were based on a consideration of current and future anticipated earnings 
income levels in and similar to those of should result in full recognition of the deferred tax assets 
the amount recorded as of december  includes the capitalization of the remaining balance of the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in full 
the company will begin reporting an income tax provision in that will utilize the deferred tax assets and will result in decreased after tax earnings and earnings per share 
however  the company will not pay any significant federal income taxes until it fully utilizes the remaining million of net operating loss carryforwards 
the company fully utilized its net operating loss carryforwards for state taxes in see note to the consolidated financial statements

foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its suppliers or customers in the last three fiscal years has adversely affected the company s ability to purchase or sell products at agreed upon prices 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future  which would affect the company s operating results 
see uncertainties and risk factors risks associated with international transactions below 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations during the past three years 
uncertainties and risk factors the company may be subject to a number of significant uncertainties and risks including  without limitation and without purporting to be a complete or exhaustive list  those described below and those described elsewhere in this report  which may ultimately affect the company in a manner and to a degree which cannot be foreseen at this time 
risks relating to commercialization of new products the extent and pace of market acceptance of the company s new products  including its glaucoma wick  icl and staarvisc tm viscoelastic solution  will be a function of many variables  as follows the product s efficacy  performance and attributes  the ability of the company to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts  including educating ophthalmologists and other potential customers as to the distinctive characteristics and benefits of these products  the rate at which ophthalmologists attain the necessary surgical skills to implant the new products  the ability of the company to meet manufacturing and delivery schedules  and product pricing 
the extent and pace of market acceptance will also depend upon general economic conditions affecting customers purchasing patterns 
as the glaucoma wick and icl are new medical devices  there is a material risk that the marketplace may not accept or be receptive to the potential benefits of these products 
unless and until the company s new product lines are accepted by the market and generating meaningful revenues and profits  the company s financial condition and prospects will continue to be solely dependent upon its line of cataract products 
see uncertainties and risk factors government regulation and uncertainty of product approval and business products 
highly competitive industry  rapid technological change competition in the ophthalmic industry is intense and characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change 
the company has licensed certain of its patents and technologies relating to its cataract products to competitors 
many of the company s current and prospective competitors have greater financial  technical and marketing resources and trade name recognition than the company  which may enable them to successfully develop and or market products based on technologies or approaches similar to those of the company  or develop products based on other technologies or approaches  which are  or may be  competitive with the company s products 
development by competitors of new or improved products  processes or technologies may make the company s products less competitive or obsolete 
the company will be required to devote significant financial and other resources to enhance its existing products and develop new products for the ophthalmic industry 
competitive pressures could lead to a decline in sales volumes of existing products  the inability to attain sufficient market penetration for new products  or price reductions  any or all of which could adversely affect the company s operating and financial results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the industry  particularly in view of rapid technological change 
see business competition in item government regulation and uncertainty of product approval the manufacture and sale of the company s products are subject to extensive international and domestic regulation 
in order to sell these products within the united states  clearance or approval from the fda is required 
the fda clearance or approval process is expensive and time consuming  and no assurance can be given that any of the company s products which have not received fda clearance or approval to date will obtain such fda clearance or approval on a timely basis or at all  or without delays adversely affecting the marketing and sale of the company s products 
foreign regulatory requirements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may  in some cases  be more stringent or difficult to obtain than fda clearance or approval 
in order to sell products in the countries comprising the european economic union the union  the company must satisfy  by no later than  certain union wide regulatory requirements  notwithstanding the company s previous receipt of approvals from member countries 
no assurance can be given that the company will obtain such regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all  or without delays adversely affecting the marketing and sale of the company s products 
in addition  clearances or approvals that have been or may be granted are subject to continual review  which could result in product labeling restrictions  withdrawal of products from the market or other adverse consequences 
to date  the company has conducted clinical studies in certain foreign countries on the feasibility of using the glaucoma wick for the treatment of glaucoma 
there can be no assurance that the initial clinical trial results from these studies are necessarily indicative of future clinical trial results with respect to the glaucoma wick 
there can be no assurance that long term safety and efficacy data  when collected  will be consistent with the clinical results and will demonstrate that the glaucoma wick can be used safely and successfully to treat glaucoma in a broad segment of the patient population or on a long term basis 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that there will be no serious complications or side effects  or that any such complications or side will not impair or delay the company s obtaining regulatory approval for the glaucoma wick in the united states and other key markets 
to date  the company has only conducted preliminary studies in certain foreign countries on the feasibility of using the icl for the treatment of myopia and hyperopia 
the company has not yet developed any long term safety or efficacy data on the icl 
there can be no assurance that the preliminary feasibility results are necessarily indicative of any results of any future clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that any long term safety and efficacy data  when collected  will demonstrate that the icl can be used safely and successfully to treat myopia or hyperopia on a long term basis 
further  no assurance can be given that complications of icl surgeries will not be serious or will not impair or delay the company in obtaining regulatory approval for the icl in the united states and other key markets 
in addition to the review and approval process for its products  the company is also subject to government regulation of its manufacturing facilities and procedures including good manufacturing practice regulations promulgated by the fda 
the company believes it is in compliance with all applicable regulations 
however  the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries have substantial discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of applicable regulations 
there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by any regulatory bodies  including the fda  with possible retroactive effect  will not adversely affect the company 
moreover  the company could suffer a material adverse effect from a change in these regulations 
the company cannot predict the extent or impact of future federal  state  local or foreign legislation or regulation 
see business regulatory requirements in item if as a result of fda inspections  mdr reports or other information  the fda believes that the company is not in compliance with the law  the fda can institute proceedings to detain or seize products  enjoin future violations  and or assess civil or criminal penalties against the company and its officers or employees 
although the company and its products have not been the subject of any such fda enforcement action  any such action by the fda could result in a disruption of the company s operations for an undetermined time 
patents and proprietary rights the company s ability to compete effectively is materially dependent upon the proprietary nature of the designs  processes  technologies and materials owned  used by or licensed to the company 
although the company attempts to protect its proprietary property  technologies and processes through a combination of patent law  trade secrets and non disclosure agreements  there is no assurance that any or all of these measures will prove to be effective 
for example  in the case of patents  there can be no assurance that existing patents granted to the company or its licensors will not be invalidated  that patents currently or prospectively applied for by the company or its licensors will be granted  or that patents will provide significant commercial benefits 
moreover  it is possible that competing companies may circumvent patents the company or its licensors have received or applied for by developing products which closely emulate but do not infringe the company s or its licensor s patents  and thereby market products that compete with the company s products without obtaining a license from the company 
in addition to patented or potentially patentable designs  technologies  processes and materials  the company also relies on proprietary designs  technologies  processes and know how not eligible for patent protection  and there is no assurance that competitors may not independently develop the same or superior designs  technologies  processes and know how 
the company believes that the international market for its products is as important as the domestic market  and therefore seeks patent protection for its products or those of its licensors in selected foreign countries 
because of the differences in foreign patent and other laws concerning proprietary rights  the company s products may not receive the same degree of protection in certain foreign countries as they would in the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully defend its patents and proprietary rights 
the invalidation or circumvention of key patents principally the company s core patents for insertion of foldable or deformable iols through minimally invasive surgical techniques or proprietary rights owned by or licensed to the company could have an adverse effect on the company and on its business prospects 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to defend against litigation involving the patents or proprietary rights of others  or that licenses under such rights will be available 
legal and accounting costs relating to prosecuting or defending patent infringement litigation may be substantial 
see business intellectual property rights in item third party reimbursement the company s ability to sell its products is  in part  dependent upon policies of government or private third party payors regarding reimbursement to ophthalmic surgeons with respect to their use of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that such third party payors will continue to authorize or otherwise budget reimbursement for use of the company s existing products principally its iols at current levels 
for example  reimbursement rates for iols  such as that of medicare  have declined in recent years 
changes in policies regarding reimbursement for ophthalmic products or services could adversely affect the prospects for future sales of the company s products 
the company does not expect that icls will be eligible for reimbursement  and there can be no assurance that any of the company s other new products will be eligible for reimbursement by government or private third party payors
