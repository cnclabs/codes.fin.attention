item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview variability of quarterly results 
the company s software product license revenues can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon  among other things  such factors as overall trends in the united states and international economies  new product introductions by the company  hardware vendors and other software vendors  and customer buying patterns 
because the company typically ships software products within a short period after orders are received  and therefore maintains a relatively small backlog  any weakening in customer demand can have an almost immediate adverse impact on revenues and operating results 
moreover  a substantial portion of the revenues for each quarter is attributable to a limited number of sales and tends to be realized in the latter part of the quarter 
thus  even short delays or deferrals of sales near the end of a quarter can cause substantial fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
finally  certain agreements signed during a quarter may not meet the company s revenue recognition criteria resulting in deferral of such revenue to future periods 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a small variation in the timing of the recognition of specific revenues can cause significant variation in operating results from quarter to quarter
