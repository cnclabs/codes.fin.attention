all nonagency issues held are currently rated aa or aaa by either standard poors or moody s 
at december   approximately of the mortgage backed securities are floating rate issues  the majority being indexed to the constant maturity treasury index 
management s normal practice is to purchase securities at or near par value to reduce risk of premium write offs resulting from unexpected prepayments 
at december   the company had no structured notes as currently defined by regulatory agencies in the securities portfolios since management believes the uncertainty of cash flows from these securities  which are driven by interest rate movements  could expose the company to greater market risk than traditional securities 
funding the most important and stable source of funding is core deposits  considered by management to include demand deposits  interest bearing transaction accounts  saving deposits and time deposits under  core deposits for increased  or million to million from million for excluding the savings bank acquisition  the increase was  or million 
local markets for deposits are competitive 
core deposits are a decreasing portion of average interest bearing liabilities 
the core deposit base is supplemented with brokered deposits  short term and long term borrowings to fully fund loan growth 
average brokered deposits amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
average short term and long term borrowings were million for  up from million for and million for management anticipates an increasing need to rely on non core funding 
the company s subsidiary banks have obtained various short term and long term advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb under blanket agreements for advances and security agreements agreements 
the agreements entitle the subsidiary banks to borrow additional funds from the fhlb to fund mortgage loan programs and satisfy other funding needs 
additional funding totaling approximately million is available at december  from undrawn federal funds purchased  lines of credit for us treasury notes and fhlb advances

nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate increased to at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the increase in nonperforming assets is principally due to one million loan that is past due days  one million nonaccrual loan and numerous small consumer loans 
management was prepared for the increased level of consumer chargeoffs and nonperforming loans and believes that the level will remain relatively high compared to prior periods due to the cyclical nature of consumer credit 
there are generally good economic conditions in the market area and management believes the company s comprehensive loan administration and workout procedures are adequate to manage the credit risks 
also  diversification within the loan portfolio is an important means of reducing inherent lending risks 
at december   the company had no concentrations of ten percent or more of total loans in any single industry nor any geographical area outside of the paducah  kentucky  western kentucky region  the immediate market area of the subsidiary banks 
the company discontinues the accrual of interest on loans which become ninety days past due as to principal or interest  unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
other real estate owned is carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
a loan is classified as a renegotiated loan when the interest rate is materially reduced or the term is extended beyond the original maturity date because of the inability of the borrower to service the debt under the original terms

a significant focus on underwriting standards is maintained by management and the subsidiary bank boards 
internal credit review procedures are designed to alert management of possible credit problems which would create serious doubts as to the future ability of borrowers to comply with loan repayment terms 
at december   loans with a total principal balance of million have been identified that may become nonperforming in the future  compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase was due to two commercial loan relationships 
management is working closely with these borrowers in their efforts to resolve potential cash flow problems 
potential problem loans are not included in nonperforming assets since the borrowers currently meet all applicable loan agreement terms 
capital resources and dividends the company s believes that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability  as well as depositor  investor and regulator confidence 
stockholders equity was of assets at december   an increase from at december  exclusive of unrealized net gain and loss on securities held for sale  net of applicable income taxes  stockholders equity increased million  or  during  and increased million  or  during the capital base has been strengthened through the issuance of common stock and earnings retention 
common stock was issued for the savings bank acquisition and through various shareholder and employee plans 
the earnings retention rate  which the board of directors adjusts through declaration of cash dividends  was for  for and for proceeds from the sale of common stock through shareholder and employee plans amounted to million in  million in and million in during  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock in the open market 
a total of  shares were repurchased during the year for million 
unrealized gain or loss on securities held for sale  net of applicable income taxes  is recorded directly to stockholders equity 
for  stockholders equity was decreased by million  for was increased by million and for was decreased by million to record the change during the year in the fair value of securities held for sale 
the board of directors develops and reviews the capital goals and policies of the consolidated entity and each of the subsidiary banks 
the company s capital policies are designed to retain sufficient amounts for healthy financial ratios  considering future planned asset growth and to leverage stockholders equity to a desirable degree 
all of the company s subsidiary banks were well capitalized based on the regulatory defined minimums of a tier i leverage ratio of  a tier i capital ratio of and a total capital ratio of 
subsidiary bank dividends are the principal source of funds for the company s payment of dividends to its stockholders 
at december   approximately million in retained earnings of subsidiary banks was available for dividend payments to the company without regulatory approval or without reducing capital of the respective banks below minimum standards 
the board of directors raised the quarterly dividend to per share in the third quarter of  to per share in the second quarter of and to per share in the fourth quarter of stock dividends of were declared in april  january and january results of operations net income increased in  reaching a record level of million  compared to an increase of in when net income was million 
on a per common share basis  net income increased to per share for the year ended december   compared to an increase of to per share for the year ended december  net income per common share for the fourth quarter of increased to from for the fourth quarter of the increase in earnings was primarily due to increased interest margins and improved noninterest income partially offset by higher provisions for loan losses and overhead 
strong loan growth  reductions in deposit insurance expense and the absence of acquisition related expense contributed to the earnings increase 
earnings performance for was negatively impacted by transaction costs of approximately per share related to two acquisitions completed during that year 
performance measures continue to show consistent improvement 
return on average stockholders equity for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
return on average assets for the years ended  and was  and  respectively 
net interest income the primary source of income for the company remains net interest income  the amount by which interest earned on assets exceeds the interest paid on supporting funds 
measured on a fully taxable equivalent te basis  net interest income for the year ended december   increased  or million to million compared to million for for the year ended december   net interest income te increased  or million from million for two important factors determine net interest income 
they are the volume of earning assets and the margin earned thereon 
the resilient economy of the midwest area and the desire to be a prominent lender is apparent in loan growth  the company s primary earning asset 
more than one half of s increase and all of s increase is attributable to growth in the volume of average earning assets 
the fully taxable equivalent net interest income margin on average earning assets was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
management s deliberate efforts to concentrate on appropriate pricing is reflected in the increased margin 
time deposits  the highest cost funding source  were of the average of all interest bearing liabilities for  down from for competitively priced short term money market accounts partially contributed to customer choices 
the subsidiary banks generally maintain a relatively balanced position between volumes of rate repricing assets and liabilities to guard to some degree against adverse effects to net interest income from possible fluctuations in interest rates 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses reflects management s judgement of the cost associated with credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million for  an increase of compared to million for  which was an increase of compared to million in the increases were required to reflect the growth in outstanding loans and chargeoffs  particularily consumer loan chargeoffs 
the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average loans was for the year ended december   up from for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  net loan chargeoffs over most of the last three years were at levels below historical trends 
net chargeoffs for were million compared to million for and million for as a percentage of average loans  net chargeoffs were for  up from for and for  periods of low net chargeoffs 
net chargeoffs as a percent of average loans were for the five year period ended december  the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which management considers adequate to absorb estimated potential losses in the loan portfolio  after reviewing the individual loans and in relation to risk elements in the portfolios and giving consideration to the prevailing economy and anticipated changes 
at december   the allowance for loan losses is of outstanding loans compared of outstanding loans at december  the december  allowance is of nonperforming assets compared to at december  this reduction is due to an increase in nonaccrual and past due loans  most of which were in the process of collection 
noninterest income noninterest income is an important but not yet significant source of revenue for the company  representing of tax equivalent net revenues in  compared to in and in noninterest income amounted to million in  a increase compared to million in which was an increase of compared to million in excluding net securities gains  the and increases were more comparable and were and  respectively 
management desires to increase annual noninterest income revenue by by focusing on increased business activity in the trust department  insurance  brokerage activities and other commission business 
service charges on deposit accounts  the largest component of noninterest income  increased in and in the increases are attributable to account growth coupled with more uniform application of charges 
net securities gains of  and  were recognized in and  respectively 
securities held for sale  primarily mortgage backed securities  totaling million and million  were sold in and  respectively  to reduce  the company s interest rate sensitivity on assets in response to changing interest rates and prepayment risks as a part of the company s asset liability strategies 
trust fees for increased from which increased from these increases match the growth in the amount of trust assets managed which were primarily in estate and personal trust accounts 
following growth rates of and in insurance commissions in and  respectivley  attributable to greater opportunities resulting from the significant increase in consumer loans  the company s penetration of this product was less successful in income from secondary market mortgage loan services  investment brokerage services and property and casualty insurance products all generated higher level of fees in due to account growth 
noninterest expense the ratio of noninterest expense net of noninterest income exclusive of securities gains to average total assets was for  for and for management continues to focus on controlling the rate of increase of noninterest expense through employee productivity 
the company consolidated six of the previously separate corporate subsidiaries into one bank during and to allow the personnel at all locations to better focus on consistent quality customer service  increasing the volume of business and to reduce a small amount of redundant costs 
noninterest expense increased in to million  reflecting higher equipment and data processing expenses 
noninterest expense decreased in to due to reduced deposit insurance rates and the absence of merger related professional fees 
this compares to an increase of in when all categories of noninterest expense rose 
salaries and employee benefits increased in  compared to in staffing levels were approximately the same at december  and the company has made investments in equipment and facilities of approximately million during the last three years as technology has advanced and the need to leverage personnel costs has intensified 
occupancy expense increased in  in and in equipment expense increased in  in and in due to depreciation and maintenance of new equipment 
much of the recent years equipment purchases are electronic and technology related assets which the company depreciates over a five year or shorter period 
management plans to continue to invest in technology for new product delivery systems 
deposit insurance expense totaled million in  an increase of  compared to million in deposit insurance expense decreased in from million in in the third quarter of  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic made a special assessment on savings banks deposits of for every of savings bank deposits on march  the amount of the special assessment paid in by the company s two savings bank subsidiaries was million 
in the second quarter of  the fdic reduced the rate paid by most commercial banks from to per of insured deposits and effective january  the rate was reduced to a  annual minimum per bank 
all of the company s subsidiaries received the lowest applicable deposit assessment rates from the fdic 
management expects the level of deposit insurance expense to be insignificant in increased data processing expense is attributable to a greater volume of activ ity and the outsourcing of a portion of credit card functions 
the increase was in and in kentucky bankshare taxes increased in compared to a small reduction in this expense occurred in due to the consolidation of six separate banking corporations 
the company s bank subsidiaries are required to maintain significant noninterest bearing balances with the federal reserve and to pay fees to regulatory agencies for periodic examinations by the agencies 
income taxes the company s income tax planning is based on the goal of maximizing long term after tax profitability 
income tax expense is impacted by the mix of taxable versus tax exempt revenues from securities and loans as well as certain nondeductible expenses 
the company manages the effective tax rate to some degree based upon changing tax laws  particularly alternative minimum tax provisions  the availability and price of nontaxable debt securities and other portfolio considerations 
increases in income tax expense are attributable to higher operating earnings and higher effective tax rates 
the company s effective income tax rate was  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the federal income tax rate increase mandated by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of and a continued decline in the amount of tax exempt income as a percentage of operating income has increased the effective rate 
nondeductible merger related expenses also serve to increase the effective rate 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the goal of the asset liability management alm process is to manage the structure of the balance sheet to provide the maximum level of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest sensitivity risk 
the company s objective of liquidity management is to ensure the ability to access funding which enables each bank to efficiently satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers 
alm involves the funding and investment strategies necessary to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and liabilities as well as to assure adequate liquidity 
the company monitors funds available from a number of sources to meet its objectives 
the primary source of liquidity for the banks  in addition to loan repayments  is their debt securities portfolios 
securities classified as held for sale are those that the company intends to use as part of its asset liability management and that may be sold prior to maturity in response to changes in interest rates  resultant prepayment risks and other factors 
the company s access to the retail deposit market through individual locations in thirteen different counties has been a reliable source of funds 
additional funds for liquidity are available by borrowing federal funds from correspondent banks  federal home loan bank borrowings and brokered deposits 
various types of analyses are performed to ensure adequate liquidity  and to evaluate the desirability of the relative interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities 
management considers current liquidity positions of the subsidiary banks to be adequate to meet depositor and borrower needs 
because banks must assume interest rate risks as part of their normal opera tions  the company actively manages its interest rate sensitivity as well as liquidity positions 
both interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are affected by maturing assets and sources of funds  however  management must also consider those assets and liabilities with interest rates which are subject to change prior to maturity 
management seeks to fairly closely match the duration of repricing assets and liabilities over time to avoid unnecesary interest rate risks 
currently  the company does not employ interest rate swaps  financial futures or options to affect interest rate risks

o nonaccrual loans are included in the rate sensitive category 
o the scheduled maturities of mortgage backed securities assume principal prepayments on dates estimated by management  relying primarily on current and concensus interest rate forecasts in conjunction with historical prepayment schedules 
o transaction and savings deposits that have no contractual maturities are scheduled according to management s best estimate of their re pricing in response to changes in market rates 
the subsidiary banks and the company collectively measure their level of earnings exposure to future interest rate movements 
simulation and interest rate gap analyses are used to scrutinize the sensitivity of net interest income over a relatively short years time horizon 
the analyses are used to examine the impact on earnings of an immediate interest rate shock as well as other forecasted interest rate scenarios 
each scenario incorporates what management believes to be the most reasonable assumptions about such variables as volumes  prepayment rates for mortgage assets and repricing characteristics 
a valuation analysis is also performed to measure the sensitivity of the company s net interest income 
this analysis involves discounting projected future cash flows of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions to arrive at an estimated net present economic value 
industry developments on september   the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the branching act was enacted 
under the branching act  beginning september   adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding companies are allowed to acquire banks across state lines  without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by state law  however  they will be required to maintain the acquired institutions as separately chartered institutions 
any state law relating to the minimum age of target banks not to exceed five years will be preserved 
under the branching act  the federal reserve board will not be permitted to approve any acquisition if  after the acquisition  the bank holding company would control more than of the deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or or more of the deposits in the state where the target bank is located 
the federal reserve board could approve an acquisition  notwithstandig the limit  if the state waives the limit either by statute  regulation or order of the appropriate state official 
in addition  under the branching act beginning on june   banks will be permitted to merge with one another across state lines and thereby create a main bank with branches in separate states 
the company has current plans to merge the tennessee savings bank into the kentucky commercial bank in the third quarter of after establishing branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction  the bank could establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where any bank involved in the merger could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law 
the company regularly explores opportunities for acquisitions in the adjoining interstate area 
branching act provisions are designed to allow acquiring companies the opportunity to operate more efficiently 
under the branching act  states may adopt legislation permitting interstate mergers before june  in contrast  states may adopt legislation before june   subject to certain conditions  opting out of interstate branching 
if a state opts out of interstate branching  no out of state bank may establish a branch in that state through an acquisition or de novo  and a bank whose home state opts out may not participate in an interstate merger transaction 
none of the states contiguous with western kentucky have opted out of interstate branching
