item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with accompanying financial statements 
productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
total um asset turns ratio of sales to total assets declined in because sales decreased while average total assets increased from the prior year 
year ending total assets declined because the increase in non cash assets  due primarily to the investment in ireland manufacturing facilities  was more than offset by the use of excess cash generated from profitable operations to repurchase the company s shares 
until um expands sales of new ob gyn products to offset lost sales of blood pressure monitoring transducers to baxter  which prior to represented about of total sales  total asset productivity will remain below the targeted turn rate of net after accumulated depreciation property  plant and equipment assets pp e in utah decreased  but in ireland increased million 
utah pp e asset turns based on ending pp e asset balances were  still an excellent ratio for a vertically integrated manufacturing company 
consolidated pp e asset turns were based on year ending balances  as more than million in ireland facilities was invested without significant contribution by those assets in generating revenues in inventory turns declined in due to lower sales with higher average inventory balances 
higher average inventory balances resulted from um not shutting off its suppliers as rapidly as baxter reduced its purchases of um products  maintaining higher balances as a contingency as certain production operations were transferred to ireland  and ramping up production of newer products  especially deltran iv and cordguard  in anticipation of better sales results 
the year ending accounts receivable a r balance declined almost million  allowing calculated days in receivables to improve to  based on q shipments volume 
the calculation overstates the improvement because of the decline in baxter business 
ignoring q baxter sales  days in receivables improved to at the end of  aged a r over days from invoice date were about of total accounts receivable 
working capital declined almost million in  caused by the cash investment of million in ireland pp e and the repurchase of stock that exceeded net income by million 
components of the change included ending cash equivalents down about million  total receivables down about million  inventories up million  and other miscellaneous working capital items down million 
current liabilities c l were up because of million still due the ireland contractor 
otherwise c l were down in proportion to lower sales activity 
through its excellent profitability  um can internally finance its planned non cash working capital growth that is needed to support new sales growth 
in  operations are expected to continue to generate after tax cash at a rate similar to b liabilities 
um has no long term debt obligations 
current liabilities are expected to grow in conjunction with the increase in expenses associated with higher sales 
the total debt ratio which is made up almost entirely of current liabilities at the end of was about 
results of operations 
a revenues 
in  revenues were down from on a quarter to previous year s quarter basis  revenues were respectively up  down  down and down 
um divides revenues into three product line categories critical care  which is comprised primarily of components used in invasive blood pressure monitoring  but also includes components for other types of pressure monitoring  as well as disposable respiratory products used in hospitals  obstetrics  which is comprised mainly of devices for monitoring intrauterine pressure during labor and delivery  although to a lesser extent electrodes for fetal heart rate monitoring as well as other labor and delivery supplies  and a new product which unifies and improves clinician safety in  the multiple step procedure of cutting  clamping and drawing blood samples from the umbilical cord immediately following childbirth  and gynecology  which is comprised of an electrosurgery system and electrodes used in a procedure called letz r as well in other types of electrosurgeries  tools used in other minimally invasive surgical procedures including diagnostic laparoscopies  and a device for conservative treatment of urinary incontinence 
in these three areas  um s primary revenue contributors generally enjoy a dominant market share and have important product features protected by patents 
in  um intends to expand sales of its new products epitometm  libertytm  cordguard r  filtresse r and lumin r which were launched in and  as well as introduce other products in areas of focus including fetal monitoring  electrosurgery and incontinence therapy 
critical care revenues represented of total sales  and declined from in the us  critical care blood pressure monitoring is a mature business dominated by two large suppliers  baxter and abbott 
for several years until  baxter purchased nearly million disposable pressure transducers dpt and accessories annually from um  representing about of um s sales 
in  sales to baxter declined by million  and sales to baxter represented only of um s total sales 
baxter oem revenues all of which are included in um s critical care category represented of critical care revenues compared to of critical care revenues in sales of critical care products in were  compared to  in  and  in sales to baxter in were  compared to  in and  in sales in the obstetrics sales category declined in and represented of total sales  after growing almost in new competition and distributor overstocking in the previous year limited intran r sales growth in despite a high level of initial physician enthusiasm  um s new product cordguard r did not generate expected sales to cost conscious hospitals 
sales of obstetrics products in were  compared to  in  and  in gynecology category revenues grew in  and represented of total revenues 
gynecology product sales were  in compared to  in  and  in several new products contributed modestly to sales growth  including liberty r and lumin r which were introduced in  and epitometm  um s unique electrosurgical scalpel introduced in mid um s success with its new gynecology products depends heavily on providing physician training and support for specific procedures 
marketing of new products represent significant challenges for um s resources  and will require innovative distribution approaches 
um divides its sales channels into direct and oem channels 
direct sales are sales of um s products by its own employed sales representatives  by independent commissioned representatives  or by stocking distributors in a particular geographic region 
oem sales are sales of um products by other medical device manufacturers either as a component of a kit  or as a repackaged stand alone product into markets not served by um s own direct sales resources 
in  direct sales represented about of total sales compared to about in and in in the us  direct sales represented of sales compared to in and in dividing sales into the two channels of direct sales and oem sales for the product categories of critical care products and obstetrics combined with gynecology products  yields the following split direct sales in represented and  respectively  compared to and in and and in foreign sales were  compared to  in and  in practically all international sales have been of critical care products  for which sales the company has relied heavily on the efforts of other medical device companies including baxter oem sales channel 
critical care products represented of international sales in compared to in and in sales through baxter represented of international sales in compared to in and in sales through other than baxter oem companies represented of total international sales in compared to in and in um believes it has substantial sales potential for its existing products in international markets  and therefore plans to continue to commit its resources to international business expansion 
b gross profit 
gross profit margins profit after subtracting costs of manufacturing products from revenues in were compared to in and in the improvement in average gross profit margin was achieved because of the percentage increase in sales of um s ob gyn products from of total sales in to of sales in  combined with a decrease in sales of um s least profitable product  the baxter summit dpt 
given expected faster sales growth in the obstetrics and gynecology product lines which have higher margins relative to um s critical care products  the trend in improved gross margins is expected to continue in  even though baxter sales will likely decline by a further million  reducing absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
um has improved its gross margins as a percentage of sales every year for the last eleven years 
in recent years  the improvement has come from improved manufacturing efficiencies  for example  as a result of assembly process automation  and increased direct sales through um s own employed representatives instead of distributors 
c operating profit 
operating profits  or income from operations  are the profits achieved after subtracting operating expenses from gross profits 
operating expenses are subdivided into sales  general and administrative expenses sg a and research and development expenses r d 
um further divides sg a into the two categories of sales and marketing expenses s m and general and administrative expenses g a 
in  despite the decline in sales  operating profits increased to  from  in and  in operating expenses were of sales in compared to of sales in  and in in dollar terms  operating expenses were lower than in any of the previous three years 
because of the expected large decrease in baxter sales in compared to  operating expenses in as a percentage of total sales are likely to increase substantially 
sg a expenses in increased to of revenues from of revenues  although in dollar terms sg a expenses declined to million in from million in although total sg a expenses declined  the g a expenses portion increased to million in from million in due to incremental administrative costs in starting up a new ireland subsidiary 
even though g a expenses in dollar terms are budgeted lower than actuals  they are expected to increase as a percentage of sales 
um s s m expenses pertain primarily to the direct sales portion of its business see previous page 
global direct sales increased about in while s m expenses decreased  increasing the productivity of s m resources 
in  um s s m expense ratio is expected to change substantially for two reasons the expected decline in baxter business will reduce total sales  and two additional us distributors previously representing about of domestic direct sales were terminated at the beginning of in favor of adding directly employed sales representatives 
the change in distribution will increase incremental sales due to elimination of distributor discounts  and improve gross profits  but will also increase s m expenses 
r d expenses in were of sales compared to of sales in  and in although r d expenses decreased from  um made six new product k premarketing submissions to the fda  consistent with submission activity for the previous two years 
the company employs specialist r d resources not only to internally develop its own new product ideas  but also  through joint development agreements  licensing of technology  acquisitions and other arrangements  to enhance and complete to commercialization projects initiated by others 
um expects to continue r d expenses at approximately the same dollar level in d non operating income 
non operating income includes primarily royalties from licensing um s technology to other companies  interest and capital gains from investing the company s cash  and gains losses from the sale of assets 
non operating income increased  in from  and was  higher than in the increase was due to an extraordinary payment in the first quarter of relating to the use of um s technology  which is subject to a confidentiality agreement 
otherwise  royalties remained about the same as in the prior year 
interest and investment income from cash balances in was  lower than in due to lower average cash balances 
given no change in interest rates and no extraordinary acquisition or other non interest bearing investment opportunities  investment income on cash balances is expected to be about the same as royalties received vary from period to period depending on the desire and or success of other companies in selling products licensed by um 
royalties and other income in are expected to remain about the same as in  after subtracting the extraordinary payment in the first quarter of related to the use of um s pressure monitoring technology 
e earnings before income taxes 
earnings before income taxes ebit result from adding um s non operating income to its operating profits 
ebit  as a percentage of sales  were compared to and in and  respectively 
gross margin improvements  lower operating expenses  and higher non operating income all contributed to improved ebit 
f net income and earnings per share 
net income is ebit minus income taxes 
um s net income expressed as a percentage of sales ranks in the top tier of all us publicly traded companies at  and for  and  respectively 
after income taxes  net income was  a new record for the company  compared to  in and  in the effective income tax rate in was compared to in and in year to year fluctuations in the tax rate have resulted from the use of a foreign sales corporation starting in mid  differing balances in tax exempt securities investments  differences in distribution of state income taxes  and other factors such as r d tax credits 
consolidated net income um us plus ireland subsidiary in will be incrementally helped by the income tax rate on profits added in ireland  compared to the approximate tax rate in the us earnings per share eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding fully diluted to take effect for stock options awarded which have exercise prices below the current market value 
fully diluted eps were up to 
compared to 
in eps were up from 
in ending weighted average number of common shares assuming full dilution the number used to calculate fully diluted eps were  compared to  and  shares in and  respectively 
actual outstanding common shares as of december  were  future eps can be increased by investing current net income to increase future net profits through expanded marketable product offerings and profitable business operations  or also by repurchasing stock from the marketplace  thereby reducing the number of outstanding shares 
shareholder value is improved primarily by consistently increasing eps 
although um s eps increased in  the price of its stock decreased 
in contrast  the dow jones industrial average increased  the s p index increased  the nasdaq composite index increased  and the mddi index of small medical device companies decreased 
small medical device companies were out of favor compared with the rest of the stock market in historically  um s stock price has followed closely its institutional ownership percentage  which declined in return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by um to internally finance its growth  divided by average accumulated shareholders equity during the period 
this roe ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without any external financing that would dilute shareholder interests 
for example  a roe will support growth in revenues 
achieving growth in revenues and eps without diluting shareholder interests maximizes shareholders value 
roe in was almost  and has averaged over for the last ten years 
cash flows and capital resources 
cash and equivalent balances were million at the end of  a decrease of million from december  cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital  totaled  up from  in  and  in ebdit profits from operations and non operating income  adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization expenses and asset write offs  before taxes are a measure of um s ability to generate cash 
ebdit were million  or as a ratio of sales  
ebdit have grown at a compounded annual rate for the last three years 
since  ebdit have grown at a compounded annual rate 
cash of  was used in for capital expenditures less receipts from disposal for property and equipment 
 was used for the purchase of intangible assets  including new patent filings 
remaining investing activities were the purchases and sales of investments which increased cash by a net  capital expenditures that occurred during should help the company maintain its competitive position and provide the cost effectiveness needed to support growth in new markets 
projects included i a  investment for completion of the new ireland manufacturing facility  including enhancements to the company s computer and communications systems  ii about  in molds and other tooling for new products  and iii about  to maintain and continuously upgrade pre existing utah facilities  equipment and tooling 
planned capital expenditures in new facilities  equipment and tooling  and intangible assets will be funded from cash generated from operations 
financing activities used cash of  compared to  in  and  in stock repurchases continued to comprise by far the largest use of cash from all categories 
the company repurchased its own common stock during in the amount of  compared to  in  and  in in the four years of through  um has invested  in repurchasing  of its common shares 
in  um received  from the issuance of  shares of stock due to exercises of employee options 
in the four years of through  the company has issued  new shares previously awarded under option plans  for which it has received  management believes that current cash balances plus future income from operations will provide the liquidity needed to finance internal growth plans 
in addition to the capital expenditures outlined above  um plans to use cash in for selective infusions of technological  marketing or product manufacturing rights to broaden the company s product offerings  and for continued share repurchases when the price of the stock remains extremely undervalued 
although um did not enter into any long term debt agreements in  in  the company will open an unsecured line of credit with its bank for up to  to facilitate its ability to move rapidly in the event of an opportunity to acquire another company with established revenues and market position complementary to um s 
management s outlook 
although the decline in blood pressure monitoring transducer sales to baxter accelerated much more rapidly than expected in  the full impact of the baxter change will be realized in sales to baxter in are projected to decline by another million  unless baxter modifies its current direction or um can find replacement oem customers 
the financial impact of the change will be primarily lack of absorption of um s fixed manufacturing overhead  thus limiting the growth in gross profit margins that would otherwise occur with new product sales 
to find other oem customers  um will continue to pursue us and foreign distribution partners  in addition to those enlisted in  who are interested in adding blood pressure monitoring transducers to their critical care product lines 
um believes deltran to be the recognized best transducer product available at the lowest cost of production 
in  um needs to do a better job in effectively implementing its value added ob gyn marketing strategies 
we believe the fundamental driving needs for our new ob gyn products  cordguard  liberty  lumin  epitome and filtresse are real  and the resulting potential markets total about million  ten times the market potential of um s previously established ob gyn products 
however  value added products only become successful in the marketplace if users understand and accept their value 
in that regard  we intend to redouble our marketing efforts in we also will seek distribution relationships  acquisition of complementary product lines and other innovative marketing approaches that may help expand the use of our new products 
access to hospital customers is increasingly constrained by group purchasing decisions 
proprietary products considered essential by physicians are the best competitive vehicle for um s hospital supplies business when broad product offerings and distribution leverage are limited 
therefore  with respect to cornerstone fetal monitoring fm products used in hospitals labor delivery departments  um must actively defend its existing iupc patents and continue to develop new products representing a quantum improvement in care 
it is management s hope that the fetal ph monitoring product  under development for the past four years  may become such a product 
recently  physicians in hospitals have had limited input to purchasing decisions 
decisions regarding patient care may be dominated by immediate purchase cost rather than long term total costs which are often related to the risk of bad outcomes 
however  um will continue to maintain a long term perspective and strengthen its disease management focus with ob gyn physicians who we believe are ultimately responsible for their patients well being 
um s growing number of gynecology practice tools are intended to create opportunities to sell to physicians outside the hospital 
in addition to broadening the urinary incontinence product line  we will work on doctors office gynecology products which address abnormal uterine bleeding  infertility and potential malignancies  in addition to applying the company s expertise in electrosurgery to other clinical areas where a specialized approach will provide excellent benefits 
in terms of um s undervalued share price  which has historically tracked um s institutional ownership percentage  we feel the time is opportune to introduce the company to potential foreign investors  especially given the recent listing on the new york stock exchange and new operations in ireland 
of course  we expect the continued use of um s technology by other medical device companies to continue to further enhance shareholder returns 
accounting policy changes the company has  during  adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized in the financial statements 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presents net income and earnings per share as if the fair value provisions of sfas no 
had been applied 
effective january  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
under sfas no 
 the company s investments are classified as available for sale which results in an adjustment to stockholders equity for unrealized gains and losses
