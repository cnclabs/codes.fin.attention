item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations comparison of and acquisition of xyplex 
on april   the company acquired all of the capital stock of xyplex  inc xyplex  a wholly owned subsidiary of raytheon company raytheon 
xyplex is a producer of high speed internetworking equipment  terminal servers and shared media products for business local area networks 
xyplex also provides remote access products that interconnect with phone companies wide area networks 
the purchase price was million in cash  subject to certain adjustments  and million in the form of  newly issued shares of the company s common stock 
other direct costs associated with the acquisition were approximately million 
the cash paid to raytheon was obtained from the company s bank lending group pursuant to an amendment to the company s existing credit facility entered into on april  the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and the balance sheet of xyplex was combined with the company s balance sheet as of april  the acquisition of xyplex resulted in the acquisition of intangible assets valued at million  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from five to fifteen years  goodwill of million which is being amortized on a straight line basis over twenty years  and accrued liabilities assumed of million 
acquired in process research and development valued at million was expensed at the acquisition date 
sales of xyplex products and services contributed substantial revenues to the company beginning in the third quarter  as well as resulting in increased operating expenses 
a significant portion of the increase in operating expenses for over was due to the acquisition of xyplex 
sales 
the company s sales for fiscal of million increased by million over sales of the prior fiscal year 
the increase was due primarily to million of additional sales generated by the communications segment  which did not exist prior to april  aerospace segment sales for fiscal increased by million over sales of the prior fiscal year  due to increased sales of aircraft fluid and pneumatic controls devices substantially offset by reduced sales of defense electronics products and systems 
the company has been able to achieve increased sales of its aircraft fluid and pneumatic control devices over the past three years despite relatively low new aircraft build rates in and increased emphasis has been placed on expanding sales from overhaul repairs  retrofits  upgrades and spare components to end users such as airlines  cargo carriers  maintenance stations  military bases and government agencies 
new aircraft production is on the rise  which may further contribute to an improved business climate for these company products 
the company has also positioned itself for continued growth in the aerospace segment by expanding its product offerings through acquisitions and growth in related markets  including fire and overheat detection equipment and industrial markets 
during fiscal  the company continued its prior practice of marketing its aircraft fluid control and other aerospace products to manufacturers of industrial  land based gas turbines  which are similar to jet engines 
a reduced united states defense budget contributed to both the decline in sales to the us government and delays in the receipt of new contract bookings in the aerospace segment 
gross margin 
the company s gross margin for fiscal as a percentage of sales was  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the gross margin for fiscal consists of communications segment gross margin of million of sales  and aerospace segment gross margin of million of sales 
communications segment margin as a percentage of sales increased from in to in because of sales of higher margin products related to the xyplex acquisition partially offset by an increased proportion of lower margin service and support revenues 
the decrease in aerospace segment gross margin percentage from of sales to of sales is due to decreased margins on defense electronics products and the absence in of several items which contributed million to gross margin in  offset by increased margins and improved manufacturing yields on commercial aircraft after market and industrial product lines 
aerospace segment gross margin for fiscal included a contract claim settlement of million  a credit of approximately million for income from the company s defined benefit pension plan and a million recovery related to the company s insurance claim for damage from the northridge  california earthquake 
without these items  aerospace segment gross margin would have been of sales for approximately million of pension income was reclassified from sg a expense to cost of sales in the third quarter of engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses for fiscal increased by million from the prior fiscal year 
engineering and development expenses for consist of communications segment expenses of million of sales and aerospace segment expenses of million of sales 
communications segment engineering and development expenses increased by million from to due to the xyplex acquisition in april and a full year of expense for whittaker communications  inc wci in compared with only six months of wci expense following its acquisition in april to maintain its competitive market position in the communications segment  the company expects to continue to invest a significant amount of its resources in the development of new communications products and product enhancements 
aerospace segment engineering and development expenses decreased by million from to  but are expected to grow somewhat in selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses for fiscal increased by million from the prior fiscal year  from of sales in to of sales in  primarily due to the acquisition of xyplex 
communications segment sg a expenses for fiscal were million of sales  which included amortization expense of million related to goodwill and intangible assets 
communications segment sg a expenses for were million of sales  which included amortization expense of million related to goodwill and intangible assets 
aerospace segment sg a expenses were million of sales for fiscal compared with million of sales for in  aerospace segment sg a expenses as a percentage of sales increased due to sales decreases in defense electronics products  credits  as described below  included in sg a expenses partially offset by sales increases in commercial aircraft and industrial products which were more than proportional to expense increases and streamlining actions in the defense electronics business unit 
in  aerospace segment sg a expenses reflected a credit of approximately million for income from the company s defined benefit pension plan and a million recovery related to the company s insurance claim for damage from the northridge  california earthquake 
without these items  aerospace segment sg a expenses would have been of sales for approximately million of pension income was reclassified from sg a expense to cost of sales in the third quarter of restructuring costs 
during  the company incurred certain costs for restructuring  including severance payments of million and move related costs of million 
the communications segment incurred costs of million related to streamlining xyplex and integrating it with wci 
the aerospace segment incurred costs of million related to the streamlining of the company s defense electronics business unit and the move of its safety systems division from concord  california to simi valley  california 
the aerospace segment is expected to incur additional restructuring expenses in the first quarter of fiscal in connection with the move of its safety systems division 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million in primarily as a result of higher interest rates and the incremental debt related to the acquisition of wci and xyplex 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared to an effective tax rate of for the prior fiscal year 
the nondeductibility of goodwill wci in increases the effective tax rate for periods with taxable income by increasing the tax provision with respect to income before taxes 
the nondeductibility of goodwill wci and xyplex in in a period with taxable losses decreases the effective tax rate by decreasing the tax benefit with respect to losses 
comparison of to sales for the company for fiscal were million  an increase of million over fiscal sales increased in largely as a result of the company s acquisitions of a data networking and communications business in april  which contributed million to sales  and an aerospace business in march of in the aggregate  the acquired businesses and product lines accounted for million of sales  compared to million in  reflecting the implementation of the company s previously announced strategy of growth by selective acquisitions to complement the company s existing businesses and product lines 
the acquisitions offset decreases in government sales and termination claims 
in the first quarter of  million of sales were recognized related to the partial settlement of a termination claim against a defense electronics products customer 
an additional  final settlement of million was recognized in the second quarter of gross margin for the company increased in fiscal to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales in fiscal gross margin for the communications segment was in fiscal gross margin for the aerospace segment increased to of sales from of sales in fiscal affecting the comparability of the years were three items which had a net positive impact of million on aerospace gross margin in  compared to million in the first item was recognition in of million of gross margin related to the company s insurance claim for earthquake damage brought about by the january  northridge  california earthquake 
the second item was recognition in of million of gross margin related to the company s defined benefit pension plan  while related gross margin in was million 
this actuarially determined pension income is the result of an expected return on plan assets which exceeded the interest cost on the projected benefit obligation 
the last item was a termination claim settlement which contributed million of gross margin in  compared to million in when the effects of these items are removed from both years  aerospace segment gross margin as a percentage of sales was in compared to in engineering expenses for the company as a percentage of sales increased to in from in this increase was due to the inclusion of six months of results of the communications segment in engineering expenses as a percentage of sales in the aerospace segment increased to in  from in  due to up front costs related to its industrial business product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the company as a percentage of sales increased to in from in in  the aerospace segment received a million earthquake recovery which was reflected as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
excluding the effects of the termination claim included in and revenues  as well as the earthquake recovery in  the aerospace segment s selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in from in the communications segment of the business spends more on salespeople and marketing programs  as a percentage of sales  than the aerospace segment 
consequently  the inclusion of six months of communications segment results has increased the overall percentage for the company 
during the second quarter of  concurrent with the acquisition of wci  a charge to earnings was recorded related to acquired in process research and development 
the effect was to reduce net income for the second quarter and the year by million  or per share 
during the third quarter of  a charge to earnings was recorded to reflect restructuring actions at wci  along with expenses associated with combining a substantial portion of the company s beaverton  oregon operation into the wci operation in santa clara  california 
the effect was to reduce net income for the third quarter and year by million  or per share 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal primarily as a result of higher interest rates and incremental debt from the purchase of wci 
general in fiscal   and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s sales were directly or indirectly attributable to the united states government 
all of these sales  with the exception of a minor amount in  relate to the aerospace segment 
companies engaged in supplying military equipment to the united states government are subject to competition  changes in the continuing availability of congressional appropriations  changes in contract timing and scheduling  complexity of designs and the potential for obsolescence  and other changes which may result from world events 
a loss of government business  although not anticipated by the company  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
in august  the company was awarded a cost reimbursement contract  currently valued at million  from the united states army to develop three new versions of the company s previously developed battlefield electronic countermeasures system  capable of detonating incoming artillery and mortar rounds  designated the shortstop electronic protection system seps 
during and  the company met performance requirements and developed three full scale seps development models 
the contract did not contribute a material amount of revenue to the company in or  but successful development of the new seps versions slated for delivery starting late in fiscal could  subject to all of the risks and uncertainties that apply to military procurement generally  as discussed above  result in subsequent seps production contracts  which could then have a material effect on the company s sales 
there can be no assurance  however  whether or when any such contracts would be awarded 
financial condition on april   in conjunction with the purchase of xyplex  the company amended and increased its bank credit facility and borrowed an additional million under such facility 
at that time the amended credit agreement consisted of an million revolving credit facility with a five year term and an million term loan repayable in quarterly installments over five years 
the cash payment to raytheon company for the purchase of xyplex on april  was million 
at october   the company s debt totaled million  which consisted of million of loans under the revolving credit facility  million under the term loan  million of convertible subordinated debt  and million of other debt 
in addition  there were million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the company was not in compliance with one of its financial ratio covenants under the credit agreement at july  and with several of the financial ratio covenants at october  the company has obtained waivers of the defaults up to  but not including february  consequently  bank debt in the amount of million  which otherwise would have been classified as noncurrent  has been classified as current 
the company and its bank lending group are currently discussing alternatives for reducing the company s bank debt 
some of these alternative measures may result in financing that is more expensive than the company s current bank financing 
if a reduction of the bank debt cannot be achieved  the bank lending group may elect to pursue its remedies  including acceleration of the total bank indebtedness 
there is no assurance that in future periods  the company will be in compliance with all of the financial covenants contained in its amended credit agreement or that additional waivers of the financial covenants will be obtained 
furthermore  acceleration of the debt under the bank credit agreement by the bank lending group upon the company s failure to comply with a financial covenant would be an event of default under the million convertible subordinated note issued by the company to hughes electronics corporation as partial consideration for its purchase of wci in because of this possible cross default  the entire million principal balance of the convertible subordinated note has also been classified as current debt 
the company believes that its existing cash and available credit will be adequate to meet future operating cash needs 
it is anticipated that the company will generate sufficient cash flow to service debt under its amended credit facility 
the cash flow required to service the company s debt will reduce its liquidity  which may in turn reduce its ability to fund internal growth  additional acquisitions  and capital improvements 
debt as a percent of total capitalization stockholders equity plus debt was at october   compared with at october  the increase in debt was primarily due to the acquisition of xyplex 
the current ratio at october  was  compared with at october   while working capital was million at october   compared with million at october  the decreases in the current ratio and working capital were due to the classification of bank debt and the convertible subordinated note as current debt because of the company s noncompliance with one of the financial ratio covenants in its bank credit agreement at july  and  to a lesser extent  the acquisition of xyplex 
excluding the debt reclassification  the current ratio would have been and working capital would have been million at october  cash flow provided by operations in was million  compared to million in the million decrease from to was due primarily to a decrease in net income of million  increases in deferred income tax assets and decreases in operating liabilities  offset in part by higher depreciation  amortization and an in process research and development charge 
capital expenditures during were million  compared to million for at october   there were approximately million of approved capital expenditures outstanding for the replacement and upgrade of existing plant and equipment at the company s various facilities 
funds for these and other capital expenditures are expected to be provided from operations 
capital expenditures are subject to limitations by covenants contained in the company s credit agreement 
it is anticipated that the amounts permitted by the covenants will be sufficient to allow the company to continue to maintain and upgrade existing facilities 
in april of  the company received a federal income tax refund related to and tax returns of million and related interest income of million 
in july of  the company recognized a federal income tax refund for research and development tax credits related to its tax year of million and related interest income of million 
the company s program for divestiture of its discontinued operations was substantially complete by the end of fiscal a acre parcel of land  which was formerly used by a discontinued technology unit  remains 
the land is located in the city of santa clarita  california  approximately miles from downtown los angeles 
in september  the city granted entitlements necessary to develop this property as a mixed use residential  commercial  and light industrial development 
the initial term of the entitlements was ten years 
in february  the city approved a development agreement which  among other things  extended the ten year term of the entitlements to over years 
the company is evaluating the most advantageous means to realize the value of this asset 
cash expenditures related to the environmental remediation of this property were million during subsequent event in connection with the integration and streamlining efforts in the company s communications segment  the company s board of directors on january   approved a plan that will result in a pre tax charge currently estimated at million during the first quarter of the charge will be taken to cover the one time costs of closing its santa clara  california facility and integrating those operations into its littleton  massachusetts facilities 
these one time costs include severance payments associated with the consolidation and reduction of the combined workforces  the writedown of assets to net realizable value and other costs related to this consolidation 
the enterprise hub product line will be sold through xyplex networks sales channels and will continue to be supported from the littleton facilities
