item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and of financial conditions general bard is a leading multinational developer  manufacturer and marketer of products for the large and growing health care industry 
worldwide health care expenditures approximated trillion in with about half that amount spent in the united states 
bard s segment of this industry  itself a multi billion dollar market  is primarily specialized products used mainly in hospitals  in outpatient centers and in physician s offices to meet the needs of the medical profession in caring for their patients 
we seek to focus and concentrate on selected markets with cost effective  innovative products and specialized sales forces to maximize our opportunities in these markets 
summary results consolidated net sales increased in with the growth well balanced among product groups and geographic areas 
net income increased and earnings per share rose  with and income both affected by one time charges  which are described below 
one time items affecting results net income was affected in by one time charges of million  partially offset by a total of million for the reversal of tax reserves no longer required and certain other items 
these charges and income items are described on page ii of this financial review and resulted in a net after tax reduction in income of million 
net income in was reduced by million reflecting the costs of combining the operations of medchem and ahs into bard 
net income in was reduced by million for certain legal fees and settlements 
results of operations vs 
net sales totaled billion in  a increase over price reductions totaled about worldwide while a stronger dollar reduced reported sales by 
sales of cardiovascular products rose in to million 
radiology devices showed strong growth  primarily in markets outside the us sales of cardiac assist devices acquired from st 
jude medical in january also added to the cardiovascular growth rate 
ii results of operations vs 
continued urological product group sales totaled million in  a increase over basic drainage products such as foley catheters and trays  other procedural trays  urinary bags and meters and specialty devices all contributed to this growth 
our growth in urological products was high in the us market and we continue to try to broaden our international market penetration 
surgical product group sales increased in to million with the growth in international markets a little higher than in the us the additional sales generated from the september impra acquisition contributed significantly to surgical product growth 
individual areas of good performance continue to be our vascular access catheters and ports  hernia repair fabrics  and orthopaedic irrigation devices 
this was substantially offset by declines in basic drainage and general surgery devices 
sales in the united states grew in to million  representing of worldwide sales 
urological turned in the highest growth rate of our three product groups  but surgical continues to generate the most revenue 
cardiovascular sales showed only a marginal increase in as fourth quarter new product launches did not have enough time to generate increased sales momentum 
sales outside the us grew in to million  representing of worldwide sales  compared with in growth was highest in the cardiovascular product area  primarily from strong balloon angioplasty product sales in europe 
balloon angioplasty products continued to do better outside the us due to a quicker regulatory approval process in most international markets 
sales of urological products showed a small increase outside the us significant declines in basic surgical suction  irrigation  drainage and general surgery products offset good increases in sales of several other surgical group products 
the effect of currency translation was to lower international sales by almost for the year 
excluding this effect  reported international sales would have increased over the prior year 
the geographic breakdown of sales outside the us for the last three years is europe  middle east  africa asia pacific area and western hemisphere  excluding us ii results of operations vs 
continued the cost of goods sold increased to of sales in compared with in the prior year as price declines exceeded our ability to reduce costs 
bard historically had been able to recover these costs through its strong product position in its markets or by offsetting the effect of inflation through its cost reduction programs 
recently  market price reductions have exceeded our gains in manufacturing efficiencies and our efforts to shift our mix to higher margin products 
marketing  selling and administrative expenses increased just over in  lower than the rate of growth in sales  as efforts were increased to lower expenses to help offset some of the effects of price declines 
also  we have realized synergies from the two mergers completed late in as a percent to total sales  these expenses represented in compared with in research and development spending increased over in  representing of sales  slightly less than the ratio to sales in in our efforts to reduce costs  we eliminated certain planned spending while continuing sufficient work on the programs needed for our future success

ii in the urological product group  worldwide sales increased in  all of it from outside the us  with a substantial portion the result of a full year s sales of angiomed products in versus two months of sales following the acquisition in urological sales in increased with a majority of the increase a result of sales of the contigen implant 
surgical product group sales increased in  a majority of which was outside the us a full year of sales of angiomed and vas cath products acquired in benefited this area substantially  as did strong growth in sales of vascular access catheters and ports  fabrics and mesh products for hernia repair and gastroenterology devices 
sales in of surgical products increased with the areas of vascular access  vascular fabrics and mesh and gastroenterology showing good gains 
sales of cardiovascular products increased just in a full year of angiomed product sales benefited this area along with good increases in interventional radiology and the femostop device 
us sales continued to decline as the company awaited clearance from the food and drug administration fda for new products from our usci division 
in  continued weakness in certain cardiovascular product areas resulted in a decline in sales in this group 
increased sales outside the us were more than offset by declines in the us which continued to be affected by the lack of approvals by the fda of new products from our usci division 
sales in the united states declined slightly in versus and represented of total sales

higher foreign currency values in contributed of the increase 
numerous products in all three product groups showed significant gains in revenue in sales outside the us increased in with a little more than of that growth the result of higher foreign currency values 
the growth was broad based throughout our product areas and major geographic markets 
acquisitions accounted for of this growth 
ii the cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was in and in productivity gains  cost reductions and a favorable product mix all contributed to reduced costs as a percent of sales for several years through and these factors almost matched the level of price reductions in marketing  selling and administrative expenses increased by as we invested in programs to boost future sales revenue 
the synergies from the two mergers closed late in  and from our divisional reorganization  were not realized by year end 
as a percent of sales  these expenses were in and in research and development spending continued to increase as we worked on new technologies and applications for the future

no nonrecurring items were recorded in in this category 
the effective income tax rate was in and in the tax benefit from operations in puerto rico and ireland favorably affected the tax rate each year 
the lower rate in was primarily due to the one time charge that was tax effected at us rates
