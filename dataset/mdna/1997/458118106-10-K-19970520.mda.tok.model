the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to operating results  capital expenditures and capital resources  sram market prices and manufacturing capacity utilization 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are included in  but are not limited to  those identified in factors affecting future results 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof 
overview fiscal was characterized by industry wide excess sram capacity and low selling prices 
additionally  idt was not able to fully utilize capacity at its older wafer fabrication plants  incurred new plant start up costs at both hillsboro  oregon and the philippines  and incurred significant research and development r d expense 
in december  idt recorded a significant charge to write down the carrying value of a number of assets principally related to its salinas fabrication facility 
during fiscal  revenue declined to million  compared to million during the immediately prior fiscal year 
as a result of the combination of these factors  idt recorded a net loss of million in fiscal  compared to net income of million in the prior fiscal year 
prices received for commodity sram products are highly dependent on supply and demand dynamics in the marketplace 
low sram prices  increases in worldwide sram manufacturing capacity  and customers initiatives to reduce excess inventories  led to dramatically reduced sram revenue and profits in fiscal sram accounted for of fiscal revenue  compared to of revenue for fiscal when comparing the same periods  despite the decline in sram revenue  the number of sram units and related modules shipped actually increased 
in the last half of fiscal  commodity sram unit demand began to improve  but at prices dramatically lower than recorded in fiscal both the oregon wafer fabrication plant and the new philippines assembly and test facility came on line in fiscal  and these two facilities accounted for significant growth in both company headcount and operating expenses 
while anticipated  these costs were not successfully absorbed through unit sales  as both demand and prices for commodity srams declined relative to initial expectations 
the oregon factory s output was less than the original plan  leading to higher fixed costs per unit of output 
throughout fiscal idt continued to consume significant r d resources related to new process technologies  bringing the oregon wafer facility on line  introducing new products in existing product areas and funding new product development in certain markets traditionally not served by the company 
results of operations revenues during fiscal  total units shipped increased when compared to fiscal  however  total revenues of million were below fiscal revenues of million 
revenue in fiscal increased over the prior period reflecting a combination of improved selling prices on sram products shipped during the first three quarters of the year  higher output as the company increased die production and generally increased demand across all of idt s other products 
fiscal revenue increased over the prior period 
fiscal revenue reflected growth in demand for the company s products  but average selling prices of certain products principally srams were as much as below the highest prices realized for comparable products in fiscal in fiscal  despite increased sram units and related modules shipped  sram revenues decreased by due to significant average selling price erosion for industry standard sram components 
the price decline was attributable to a number of companies  principally foreign  shifting production capacity to sram parts and therefore increasing available supply 
this increase in supply came at a time when growth in sram demand from idt s desktop computing and other customers slowed  as these customers sought to decrease the level of sram inventories that they carried 
in contrast  fiscal sram revenues increased compared to fiscal because of strong demand for fast srams for secondary cache requirements in the pc market 
looking forward  the company is uncertain as to whether pricing for commodity srams will change  primarily because the company cannot anticipate how its competitors will react to current low market prices for sram components and to an anti dumping investigation associated with srams imported from taiwan and korea  recently commenced by the international trade commission 
contrasting fiscal sales of other idt products to fiscal  net unit sales of the risc microprocessor family more than doubled while logic and specialty memory units also increased 
partially offsetting the increase in unit volume  microprocessor average selling prices declined as the product mix sold in fiscal reflected a greater proportion of embedded controller products which command lower average selling prices than standard risc microprocessor products 
in the future  the risc microprocessor product family mix sold is expected to continue to include a greater proportion of embedded controllers which have lower average selling prices compared to other microprocessor products 
the average selling price realized per unit for logic products also decreased in fiscal gross profit in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded asset impairment and other charges of million which reduced gross profit 
the million charge principally relates to adjustments to the net asset carrying values of manufacturing assets  including the company s oldest wafer fabrication plant in salinas  california  and other items 
additionally  the company recorded million in charges which relate to the write off of certain technology investments and other miscellaneous items  which have been classified in the company s statement of operations in accordance with the nature of the charge  including cost of revenue 
the charges recorded against manufacturing assets were recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
sfas requires that the company analyze whether the cash flows attributable to an asset support the value assigned to that asset in the financial statements 
where estimated cash flow is not sufficient to recover the asset s net carrying value  a fair value approach is taken towards reassigning a carrying value to the asset 
as a result of significant changes in the semiconductor industry  such as the rapid erosion of sram average selling prices  and the company s emphasis on communication oriented products  the company has accelerated the use of more advanced manufacturing processes to produce its products 
the use of these more advanced processes and available information on expected demand for the company s products indicated that the carrying value of these selected older manufacturing assets would not be fully recovered 
therefore  adjustments were recorded for the difference between net carrying value at historical costs and estimates of the fair market value of the assets 
including the above charge  and as a result of the decline in average selling price per unit sold for the products described above  gross profit in fiscal decreased or million to million or of sales 
excluding the million charge for asset impairment and other reserves  gross profit in fiscal decreased by million to million or of sales 
also impacting fiscal gross margin were adjustments for sram and other component inventories recorded because of changes in product prices and market supply 
some markets  such as telecommunications and data communications  remained robust throughout the year  but falling prices and orders in the desktop computing and other markets offset strong performance for the remainder of the company s market segments 
in fiscal gross profit increased to million when compared to fiscal in fiscal idt s gross profit as a percentage of revenue was compared to in fiscal also adversely impacting gross profit during fiscal were costs associated with the new eight inch wafer fabrication facility located in hillsboro  oregon  which were not fully offset by additional revenues 
during fiscal  as this facility began its production ramp  the facility manufactured production wafers and incurred operating costs 
during the first quarter of fiscal  substantially all operating expenses associated with the new oregon facility were classified as process engineering research and development expense  as production of salable die was not significant 
in the second and third quarters of fiscal  costs associated with the oregon facility negatively impacted gross margins  as a majority of total facility operating costs were allocated to the manufacture of products  the costs of which were charged to cost of goods sold 
the remainder of the operating costs were charged to process engineering research and development expense  based on activities performed 
in fiscal  the level of expense associated with the oregon fabrication facility is expected to increase on a quarterly basis over the levels of expense incurred during each quarter of fiscal the anticipated increased costs are associated with additional equipment to be installed and other costs incurred which are necessary to achieve more effective utilization of the facility 
additionally  in future quarters  the percentage of these costs recorded as cost of revenues may increase  based upon production volumes and activities performed 
the oregon facility provides the company with significant additional available production capacity  but  as a result of current market conditions  the company s production volumes at its wafer fabrication facilities have not increased sufficiently to take full advantage of the additional capacity 
further  the company is unable to predict whether demand for industry standard sram products or idt s share of the available market will improve 
should idt s production volumes  especially at its fabrication facilities  remain constant or decline and should the company be unable to otherwise decrease costs per unit sold  the company s gross profit will continue to be adversely impacted 
further  if prices on industry standard sram products and market demand for production volumes do not improve and if a greater percentage of the oregon facility s operating costs are allocated to cost of goods sold  based on activities performed  then it will be unlikely that gross profit in the first quarter of fiscal will improve 
idt s policy is to expense new plant startup costs to research and development r d expense until a facility is ready to begin commercial production 
in fiscal  idt also began the production ramp for its new assembly and test facility located near manila  the philippines 
throughout fiscal  the company continued its efforts to shift to smaller die designs and its most advanced wafer fabrication processes  which result in increased die per wafer and therefore lower unit costs 
however  declining average selling prices primarily for sram products and the inability of the company to take full advantage of additional manufacturing capacity more than offset manufacturing efficiencies gained through these initiatives 
research and development in fiscal  r d expenses increased to million from million in fiscal in fiscal  r d expenses increased as compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  r d expense was of fiscal revenue  of fiscal revenue  and of revenue in fiscal the company s policy is not to capitalize preoperating costs associated with new manufacturing facilities  and in fiscal and  significant facility start up and staffing expenses were incurred at the new eight inch wafer fabrication facility in hillsboro  oregon 
the increase in r d expense in each of fiscal and is principally attributable to process engineering research costs of approximately million and million  respectively  incurred at the oregon wafer fabrication plant 
additionally  in fiscal  the company wrote off to r d expense certain technology investments and equipment with a carrying value of approximately million 
in fiscal  operating expenditures associated with the start up of the oregon fabrication facility were classified in part as process engineering r d expense and  in part  cost of revenues  based upon the nature of the activities performed 
in fiscal  substantially all oregon plant expenses were charged to r d expense 
other continuing r d activities include conducting research into applications of high speed dram technology for the communications market  developing risc microprocessors for primarily communications and embedded control applications  developing an advanced sram architecture that significantly improves performance of communications applications requiring frequent switches between reads and writes  developing a family of specialty memory products for the atm market and developing microprocessors for use in general applications 
the company anticipates that in fiscal  total r d expense as a percentage of revenue will decline when compared to fiscal based upon activities to be performed at each location  the company believes a greater proportion of its manufacturing facility operating costs  including oregon facility costs  will be classified as cost of goods sold rather than process engineering r d 
idt believes that high levels of r d investment are required to support its strategy of providing products to its customers which are not readily available from its competitors 
however  there can be no assurance that additional research and development investment will result in new product offerings or that any new offerings will achieve market acceptance 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  s  g a increased as compared to million in fiscal s  g a expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal  declined to in fiscal  and were of fiscal revenue 
the fiscal decrease in absolute dollars and fiscal increase in absolute dollars in s  g a expenses were primarily attributable to variable selling expenses associated with the year over year revenue changes  changes in employee profit sharing and management bonuses which vary in relation to profitability  and changes in provisions for bad debts 
while s  g a expenses in fiscal decreased in absolute dollars  they increased as a percentage of sales because of the magnitude of the sales decrease in fiscal and the fixed nature of a portion of these costs 
in addition  the decrease in s  g a expenses was partially offset by expenses associated with initiatives to implement enterprise wide management information systems 
idt plans to continue its installation of enterprise wide management information systems in fiscal but anticipates that s  g a expenses will decrease slightly as a percentage of revenues 
interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest expense increased in and primarily due to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes the notes issued in the first quarter of fiscal in january  the company repurchased approximately million of the notes  resulting in an outstanding balance of approximately million 
in fiscal  the notes were not outstanding for the entire year 
interest capitalized during fiscal  associated with the oregon fabrication facility and the philippines assembly and test facility  amounted to approximately million 
further  fiscal gross interest expense of million was reduced by million in connection with capitalization of construction period interest for the oregon wafer fabrication plant 
all interest capitalization in connection with the construction of these facilities has now ceased 
in september  the company completed secured equipment financing agreements which totaled approximately million for equipment purchased for the oregon fabrication facility 
with the cessation of interest capitalization for the oregon and philippine projects and the addition of the secured lending facility  the company anticipates that fiscal interest expense in absolute dollars will increase when compared to fiscal interest income and other interest income and other  net  decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal interest income decreased primarily as a result of the company liquidating short term investments to pay for significant capital expenditures in fiscal also included in interest income and other for fiscal is a loss in the amount of million realized on the write off of an equity investment 
management anticipates a portfolio migration to higher yielding  non tax exempt  securities in the fourth fiscal quarter of will be offset by slightly declining average short term investment balances in fiscal  causing the interest income component of interest income to be approximately flat in absolute dollars when compared to fiscal taxes the effective tax rates for fiscal   and of   and  respectively  differed from the us statutory rate of primarily because of changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  permanently reinvested earnings of foreign subsidiaries being taxed at lower rates  and the utilization of certain tax credits 
historically  income taxes in state jurisdictions have not been significant due to available investment tax credits and research and development credits 
the company has consumed substantially all of the tax benefits associated with its malaysian subsidiary 
stock based compensation plans the company accounts for its stock option plans and its employee stock purchase plan in accordance with provisions of the accounting principles board s opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
in  the financial accounting standards board released the statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas provides an alternative to apb and is effective for idt s fiscal year 
as permitted by sfas  the company continues to account for its stock plans in accordance with apb consequently  sfas has no impact on idt s financial condition or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company generated million of funds from operations in fiscal  down from million of funds from operations during fiscal at march   cash and cash equivalents were million  a decrease of million from at march  cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected a net loss offset by depreciation and amortization  non cash charges for asset impairment and other and changes to working capital 
increased depreciation and amortization charges in fiscal were associated with new facilities  improvements to existing facilities and new equipment 
the non cash charges for asset impairment and other are described in the preceding paragraphs 
significant changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted from the timing of collection of accounts receivable  timing of payments for accounts payable  accrued payroll and bonus  and an accrual of an income tax refund receivable 
during fiscal  the company s net cash used in investing activities was million with million used for capital equipment and property and plant improvements 
cash proceeds from the equipment sale and lease back arrangements in september and december amounted to million 
cash generated from the sale of short term investments  net of purchases of short term investments  was million 
in addition  at march   the company had million of restricted securities pledged as collateral under a tax ownership operating lease entered into in january related to the construction of the eight inch wafer fabrication facility in oregon 
at march   the securities pledged as collateral amounted to of the lessor s construction costs  as required until the building was completed 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the facility was completed  and in accordance with the terms of the facility lease  the collateral requirement was reduced to of the lessor s cost to construct the facility 
therefore  as the facility was completed during the first quarter of fiscal  the lessor released as collateral million of restricted securities 
the company s total fiscal capital expenditures were approximately million  net of assets purchased and then sold and leased back  which is a reduction of approximately million from the amount originally planned for the fiscal year 
fiscal capital additions were principally in connection with continued installation of equipment in the new oregon facility plus continued equipping of the new philippine plant and other capacity improvements 
the reduction in planned capital spending primarily reflected a reduction in planned equipment additions to support lower capacity requirements associated with market conditions for industry standard sram parts  in addition to certain assets sold and leased back by the company 
in september  the company completed secured equipment financing agreements which total approximately million for equipment purchased for the oregon fabrication facility 
the borrowing arrangements fully amortize over the month terms of the loans 
additionally  in september and december  the company completed equipment sale and lease back arrangements with several leasing companies 
equipment purchased by the company for the oregon fabrication facility with a net book value of million was sold to the leasing companies and leased back for use at the oregon facility under leases classified as operating leases 
in may  the company completed the sale of million of the convertible subordinated notes  netting million in proceeds 
the notes are convertible into shares of common stock at per share 
in january  the company completed the repurchase of approximately million of the notes at a price of approximately per bond 
during fiscal  the company does not anticipate making additional repurchases of debt 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company completed the acquisition of its salinas wafer fabrication facility  which the company had been leasing from baccarat silicon  inc baccarat 
carl e 
berg  a director of the company  owned fifty percent of baccarat at the time of the acquisition 
the transaction was a tax free reorganization in which the company merged a newly created  wholly owned subsidiary into baccarat and issued an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock in exchange for all the outstanding capital stock of baccarat 
the issuance of these shares of common stock was not registered under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  by virtue of the exemption provided by section of the securities act 
in view of current and anticipated capacity requirements  idt anticipates capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  principally in connection with continued installation of equipment in the oregon facility  the philippines plant and other capacity improvements 
the company s ability to invest to satisfy its capacity requirements is in part dependent on the company s ability to generate cash from operations 
cash flow from operations depends significantly on the average selling prices of the company s products  variable cost per unit and other industry conditions which the company cannot predict 
future declines in selling prices for industry standard sram products or other products manufactured by the company  which cannot be otherwise offset  will adversely impact the company s ability to generate funds from operations 
if the company is not able to generate sufficient funds from operations or other sources to fund its capacity and r d requirements  the company s results from operations  cash flows and financial condition will be adversely impacted 
the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its working capital  mandatory debt repayment and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
while the company is reviewing all operations with respect to cost savings opportunities  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to seek other financing sooner or that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
if the company is required to seek other financing sooner  the unavailability of financing on terms satisfactory to idt could have a material adverse effect on the company 
factors affecting future results the company s results of operations and financial condition are subject to the following risk factors fluctuations in operating results idt s operating results have been  and in the future may be  subject to fluctuations due to a wide variety of factors including the timing of or delays in new product and process technology announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  competitive pricing pressures  particularly in the sram memory market  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in the mix of product sold  availability and costs of raw materials  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  industry wide wafer processing capacity  economic conditions in various geographic areas  and costs associated with other events  such as underutilization or expansion of production capacity  intellectual property disputes  or other litigation 
additionally  many of the preceding factors also impact the recoverability of the cost of manufacturing and other assets  and as business conditions change  future writedowns or abandonment of these assets may occur 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors or that the company s operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 
cyclicality of the semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
early in fiscal  markets for some of the company s srams were characterized by excess demand relative to supply and the resulting favorable pricing 
during the later part of fiscal  however  a number of companies  principally foreign  shifted manufacturing capacity to srams causing rapid adjustments to supply and consequently impacting market prices 
the resulting significant downward trend in prices in an extremely short period negatively affected sram gross margins  and adversely affected the company s operating results which historically have been dependent on sram revenues 
current market conditions characterized by excess supply of srams relative to demand and resultant pricing declines may continue 
although some competitors have recently made adjustments to the rate at which they will implement capacity expansion programs  the company is unable to accurately estimate the amount of worldwide production capacity dedicated to industry standard products which it produces 
a material increase in industry wide production capacity  shift in industry capacity toward products competitive with the company s products  reduced demand  or other factors could result in a further decline in product pricing and could also materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company has taken measures to manage costs  including deferral of capacity expansion plans and work force reductions  but there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient to return to and sustain profitability 
the company ships a substantial portion of its products in the last month of a quarter 
if anticipated shipments in any quarter do not occur  the company s operating results for that quarter could be adversely affected 
in addition  a substantial percentage of the company s products are incorporated into computer and computer related products  which have historically been characterized by significant fluctuations in demand 
furthermore  any decline in the demand for advanced microprocessors which utilize sram cache memory or towards microprocessors which incorporate on chip primary sram cache could adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  demand for certain of the company s products is dependent upon growth in the communications market 
any slowdown in the computer and related peripherals or communications markets could also materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
in order to achieve more full and effective use of the facilities  the company continues to install new equipment at the oregon and the philippines plants 
additional production capacity and future yield improvements by the company s competitors could dramatically increase the worldwide supply of products which compete with the company s products and could thereby create further downward pressure on pricing 
risks associated with planned expansion  manufacturing risks in fiscal  the company began producing salable products at the oregon fabrication and philippines assembly and test facilities 
historically  the company has utilized subcontractors for the majority of its incremental assembly requirements  typically at higher costs than its own malaysian assembly and test operations 
the company expects to continue utilizing subcontractors extensively as its philippines assembly and test plant ramps its production volumes 
due to production lead times and current capacity constraints  especially in the assembly and test production areas  any failure by the company to adequately forecast the mix of product demand could adversely affect the company s sales and operating results 
these capacity expansion programs in oregon and the philippines face a number of substantial risks including  but not limited to  cost overruns  equipment delays or shortages  power interruptions or failures  manufacturing start up or process problems or difficulties in hiring key managers  technical personnel or operators 
in addition  before fiscal  the company had never operated an eight inch wafer fabrication facility 
accordingly  the company could incur unanticipated process or production problems 
from time to time  the company has experienced production difficulties that have caused delivery delays and quality problems 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience manufacturing problems and product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  changes to its process technologies  ramping production and installing new equipment at its facilities  including the facilities in oregon and the philippines 
further  the company s older wafer fabrication facilities are located relatively near each other in northern california 
if the company were unable to use these facilities  as a result of a natural disaster or otherwise  the company s operations would be materially adversely affected until the company was able to obtain other production capability 
in response to reduced protection offered by the company s insurance carrier at economically justifiable rates  the company eliminated earthquake insurance coverage on all facilities 
the company s capacity additions have resulted in a significant increase in fixed and variable operating expenses which may not be fully offset by additional revenues for some time 
historically  the company has expensed the operating expenses associated with bringing a new fabrication facility to commercial production status as r d in the period such expenses were incurred 
however  as commercial production at a new fabrication facility commences  the operating costs are classified as cost of revenues  and the company begins to recognize depreciation expense relating to the facility 
accordingly  as the oregon fabrication and manila assembly and test facilities now contribute to revenues  the company recognizes substantial operating expenses associated with the facilities as cost of revenues  which  in the last three quarters of fiscal  reduced gross margins 
as commercial production continues in fiscal  the company anticipates incurring substantial additional operating costs and depreciation expenses relating to these facilities 
accordingly  if revenue levels do not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expense levels  or if the company is unable to achieve gross margins from products produced at the oregon and manila facilities that are comparable to the company s current products  the company s future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
dependence on new products new products and process technology costs associated with the oregon wafer fabrication facility will continue to require significant research and development expenditures 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner  that new products will gain market acceptance or that new process technologies can be successfully implemented 
if the company is unable to develop new products in a timely manner  and to sell them at gross margins comparable to the company s current products  the future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
dependence on limited suppliers the company s manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate raw materials on a timely basis 
the number of vendors of certain raw materials  such as silicon wafers  ultra pure metals and certain chemicals and gases  is very limited 
in addition  certain packages used by the company require long lead times and are available from only a few suppliers 
from time to time  vendors have extended lead times or limited supply to the company due to capacity constraints 
the company s results of operations would be adversely affected if it were unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if there were significant increases in the costs of raw materials 
idt has been significantly dependent on the design capabilities of quantum effect design  inc  an equity affiliate  for the design and development of derivatives of bit mips risc based microprocessors 
currently  there are no development contracts in effect between qed and idt 
while the company is now designing and developing derivatives of mips risc based microprocessors in house  there is significant risk that the company will not do so successfully 
see business products and markets and research and development 
capital needs the semiconductor industry is extremely capital intensive 
to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in advanced manufacturing and test equipment 
in fiscal  the company expects to expend approximately million in capital expenditures  net of assets sold and leased back  and anticipates significant continuing capital expenditures in the next several years 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to seek financing to satisfy its cash and capital needs or that such financing will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
if such financing is required and if such financing is not available on terms satisfactory to the company  its operations could be materially adversely affected 
intellectual property risks the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
in recent years  there has been a growing trend by companies to resort to litigation to protect their semiconductor technology from unauthorized use by others 
the company in the past has been involved in patent litigation  which adversely affected its operating results 
although the company has obtained patent licenses from certain semiconductor manufacturers  the company does not have licenses from a number of semiconductor manufacturers who have a broad portfolio of patents 
the company has been notified that it may be infringing patents issued to certain semiconductor manufacturers and other parties and is currently involved in several license negotiations 
there can be no assurance that additional claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights will not be asserted in the future 
the intellectual property claims that have been made or that may be asserted against the company could require that the company discontinue the use of certain processes or cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  to incur significant litigation costs and damages and to develop non infringing technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms or to develop non infringing technology 
further  the failure to renew or renegotiate existing licenses  or significant increases in amounts payable  or the inability to obtain a license  could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
risks of international operations a substantial percentage of the company s revenues are derived from export sales  which are generally denominated in local currencies 
the company s offshore assembly and test operations and export sales are subject to risks associated with foreign operations  including political instability  currency controls and fluctuations  changes in local economic conditions and import and export controls  as well as changes in tax laws  tariffs and freight rates 
contract pricing for raw materials used in the fabrication and assembly processes  as well as for subcontract assembly services  can be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
environmental risks the company is subject to a variety of regulations related to hazardous materials used in its manufacturing process 
any failure by the company to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous materials under present or future regulations could subject it to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended 
volatility of stock and notes prices the company s common stock and the notes have experienced substantial price volatility and such volatility may occur in the future  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of the company  the companies in the semiconductor industry or in the markets served by the company  or announcements by the company or its competitors regarding new product introductions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies stock in particular 
these factors may adversely affect the price of the common stock and the notes
