item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and related notes included elsewhere herein 
overview net income of the company increased to million in from million in and million in non accrual loans were million at december   compared to million a year earlier 
non performing assets amounted to million at december  and million at december  
the decrease in non performing loans and assets reflected the third quarter charge off of amounts previously recorded in the banks reserve for credit losses 
approximately of a total of million in such charge offs reduced the non accrual loan category 
non performing assets also reflected a decrease in other real estate owned to million at december  from million at december  
as set forth in results of operations general  below  the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income 
reflecting increased loan balances resulting from internal growth and the constitution acquisition  the company s interest income increased in and net interest income in increased approximately over which increased over the net interest margin  expressed as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  decreased to in from in and in the reduction in the net interest margin reflected the impact of a lower prime rate which contributed to lower loan yields 
while yields on many categories of interest bearing liabilities were also lower  yields in other categories were increased due to market pressure 
further  the proportion of higher cost non deposit funding increased  contributing to other increases in the cost of funds 
in  the company maintained net interest margins at approximately the prior year s level by continuing to maintain interest rates on many core deposits at lower levels more consistent with industry averages  and as a result of growth in demand deposit balances 
net loans at december  increased or million over the prior year reflecting internal growth 
net loans at december  increased  or million over the prior year amount 
of that increase  approximately million resulted from the acquisition of constitution 
net loans at december  increased or million over the prior year amount

results of operations general 
the company s results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest earning assets consist principally of loans and investment securities  while interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits 
the company s net income is also affected by the provision for credit losses and the level of non interest income as well as by non interest expenses  including salary and employee benefits  occupancy costs  data processing expense  charges relating to non performing and other classified assets and other expenses 
net income 
net income was million in compared to million in and million in the increases in net income in and reflect increases in net interest income which increased and  respectively  over prior year periods 
these increases reflected the impact of increased loan balances  while net interest margins expressed as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  decreased in compared to the reduction in the net interest margin reflected the impact of a lower prime rate which contributed to lower loan yields 
while yields on many categories of interest bearing liabilities were also lower  yields in other categories were increased due to market pressure 
further  the proportion of higher cost non deposit funding increased  contributing to other increases in the cost of funds 
net interest margins were comparable in and in  the company maintained net interest margins at approximately the prior year s level by continuing to maintain interest rates on many core deposits at lower levels more consistent with industry averages  and as a result of growth in demand deposit balances 
see net interest income and average balances  below 
repricing opportunities for loans and the shift in deposit base to lower cost demand  interest checking  savings and money market deposits served to increase net interest margins in in  the company reduced its cost of funds to levels more consistent with industry averages by maintaining interest rates on many core deposits at or below their lowered prior year levels when rates had generally declined 
concurrently  the company was able to increase loan rates during when rates generally rose 
the provision for credit losses amounted to million in  million in and million in see financial condition provision for credit losses  below 
service fees on deposit accounts increased to million in  compared to million in and million in increases in merchant card fees during these periods were significantly offset by increases in related expense  reflected under non interest expense as merchant credit card deposit expense 
see results of operations net interest income and average balances and non interest income  below 
net interest income and average balances 
net interest income was million in  compared to million in and million in yields on interest earning assets decreased to in from in  a difference of  and reflected the impact of a lower prime rate and other market interest rates 
while yields on many categories of interest bearing liabilities were also lower  yields in other categories were increased due to market pressure 
further  the proportion of higher cost non deposit funding increased  contributing to other increases in the cost of funds 
accordingly  the cost of interest bearing liabilities of in  was comparable to the in while yields on time deposits and interest checking decreased in as compared to  yields on savings and money markets increased 
the ratio of higher cost non deposit funding consisting of securities sold under repurchase agreements  subordinated debentures and fhlb advances  to deposits  also increased in compared to expressed as a percentage of deposits  that ratio was in compared to in yields on interest earning assets increased to in from in  a difference of 
as assets were repriced to market interest rates which continued their cycle of increases into the first half of  when the wall street journal prime peaked at 
decreases in interest rates in the latter half of were too modest to offset the effect of the increases in the first half of the year 
such decreases did result in a prime rate of for most of the latter half of accordingly  the cost of interest bearing liabilities also increased  to in  from in  a difference of as liabilities adjusted to market interest rates more rapidly than assets 
in the company was nonetheless able to maintain interest rates on many core deposits at lower levels relative to market rates which were more consistent with industry averages  as it had done in also in  increases in demand deposits served to partially offset the impact of increases in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
accordingly  net interest margins of in and in were comparable 
however  the company s cost of funds  which was high relative to the industry before  may increase in the future 
in addition to matching its local competitors rates  which may fluctuate significantly  a higher relative proportion of certificates of deposit  if required to fund loan growth or increase liquidity  might serve to increase the cost of funds

liquidity and capital resources liquidity defines the ability of the company to generate funds to support asset growth  meet deposit withdrawals  satisfy borrowing needs  maintain reserve requirements and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis 
during the past three years  the liquidity needs of the company were primarily met by cash on hand  deposits in other banks  federal funds sold and the sale of investment securities 
the company invests its funds not needed for operations excess liquidity primarily in daily federal funds and securities 
the major source of funds for the company s investing activities are cash inflows resulting from net increases in deposits 
advances from the fhlb are also periodically utilized 
net increases in fhlb advances amounted to million in as compared to million in and million in net deposits decreased million in after increasing million and million respectively in and the decrease in reflected seasonal fluctuations 
funding was directed primarily at cash outflows required by net increases in loans of million  million and million  respectively  in  and cash flows in were also increased from an offering of million of subordinated notes 
in addition to demand  interest checking and savings and money market deposit growth  the company utilizes certificates of deposit to fund its loans 
amounts of such certificates have historically been generated by matching upper market philadelphia area certificate of deposit rates 
operating activities include cash outflows for residential mortgages originated for sale  which amounted to million  million and million  respectively  in  and outflows for mortgages originated for sale are generally offset within days by the receipt of related sales proceeds 
securities cash outflows represent purchases of investment securities 
investment securities available for sale may be sold for liquidity purposes as necessary 
investment securities held to maturity are available for liquidity after such maturity 
the cash flow balances from the banks acquired by the company were excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows and from the preceding discussion since they arose when such banks were independent of the company 
the company knows of no adverse conditions which would impact the continued short or long term use of its cash inflows as heretofore described 
to enhance liquidity  jefferson pa maintains membership in the fhlb 
thus  it may obtain overnight funding of up to of its total assets at rates approximately 
over daily federal funds rates by pledging first mortgage residential collateral against such advances 
longer term funding at rates approximately 
over us treasury rates is also available 
as of december   the company had outstanding million of overnight advances  all of which matured in january both the company and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with certain risk based capital adequacy guidelines issued by the frb for the company and the fdic for the subsidiary banks 
the risk based capital guidelines assign varying risk weights to the individual assets held by a bank 
the guidelines also assign weights to the credit equivalent amounts of certain off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit and interest rate and currency swap contracts 
under these guidelines  institutions are expected to meet minimum ratios for qualifying total capital and tier capital to risk weighted assets of and respectively and a minimum leverage ratio the ratio of tier capital to total average assets of plus an additional cushion of between and 
as used in the guidelines  tier capital includes common shareholders equity  certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
tier capital components limited in the aggregate to one half of total qualifying capital include allowances for credit losses within limits  certain excess levels of perpetual preferred stock and certain types of hybrid capital instruments  subordinated debt and other preferred stock 
the subordinated debt component of tier capital is reduced by per year over the last five years of the term of the subordinated debt

asset and liability management the management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities is essential to controlling interest rate risk and optimizing interest margins 
an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market rates 
interest rate sensitivity measures the relative volatility of a bank s interest margin resulting from changes in market interest rates 
the following table summarizes repricing intervals for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   and the difference or gap between them on an actual and cumulative basis for the periods indicated 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of falling interest rates  a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely

certain assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in interest rates even though they reprice or mature in the same or similar time periods 
the interest rates on certain assets and liabilities may change at different times than changes in market interest rates  with some changing in advance of changes in market rates and some lagging behind changes in market rates 
also  certain assets  eg  adjustable rate loans  often have provisions which may limit changes in interest rates each time the interest rate changes and on a cumulative basis over the life of the loan 
additionally  the actual prepayments and withdrawals experienced by the company in the event of a change in interest rates may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the data shown in the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase

loans are considered to be non performing if they are on a non accrual basis or terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a weakening in the financial positions of the borrowers 
a loan which is past due days or more and still accruing interest remains on accrual status only when it is both adequately secured as to principal and accruing interest and is in the process of collection

of the million in non accrual loans at december   million resulted from the constitution acquisition  and  remained from the chester county and security first acquisitions 
activity in  a year in which there were no acquisitions  reflected million of additions   of transfers to other real estate owned   of returns to accrual status  million of charge offs and million of payments 
activity in  excluding the remaining year end balances from the constitution acquisition  reflected million of additions  million of transfers to other real estate owned  million of returns to accrual status  million of charge offs and million of payments 
non accrual loans were million at december  representing an increase of million over the prior year 
that increase reflected approximately million resulting from the chester county and security first acquisitions 
the balance of the increase consisted primarily of two loans 
the larger of these two loans originally was in the amount of million   of which was charged off and the balance of which was recovered through a sale 
loans days or more past due at december  were million 
the million decrease from the prior year end reflected the elimination of substantially all amounts resulting from the constitution acquisition 
loans past due days or more at december  were million and reflected million from the constitution acquisition 
although significant increases in non accrual loans resulted from acquisitions  management believes that such loans are adequately reserved in the allowance for credit losses

provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses is an amount charged against earnings to fund the reserve for possible future losses on existing loans 
in order to determine the amount of the provision for credit losses  the company conducts a quarterly review of the loan portfolio to evaluate overall credit quality 
this evaluation consists of an analysis of individual loans and overall risk characteristics and size of the different loan portfolios  and takes into consideration current economic and market conditions  changes in non performing loans  the capability of specific borrowers to repay specific loan obligations as well as current loan collateral values 
the company also considers past estimates of possible loan losses as compared with actual losses  potential problems relating to sizable loans and large loan concentrations if any 
as adjustments become identified  they are reported in earnings for the period in which they become known 
the provision for credit losses was million in  as compared to million in and million in the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans was  and respectively at december   and the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to non performing assets was  and at december   and the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to non accrual loans  including loans days past due still accruing interest  was  and at december   and  respectively

management of the company has not attempted to allocate specific portions of the allowance for credit losses to specific loan categories 
however  the company regularly monitors the credit worthiness and financial condition of its significant borrowers  in all loan categories 
the company determines the level of its allowance for possible credit losses based on a number of factors 
an analysis of individual commercial business loans  commercial real estate and construction loans as well as internally classified loans is conducted and specific reserves are allocated for those credits which are determined to have weaknesses 
in addition  an analysis based upon historical loss experience is conducted 
in this analysis  the company applies its loss experience over the preceding eight fiscal quarters in each loan portfolio segment to the balance outstanding in such segment at the end of the period as to which the determination of allowance adequacy is being made  and uses this analysis as a predictor of future loss 
in conjunction with the above analyses  the company considers both internal and external factors which may affect the adequacy of the allowance for possible credit losses 
such factors may include  but are not limited to  present and prospective industry trends and regional and national economic conditions  past estimates of possible loan losses as compared to actual losses  potential problems with sizable loans and large loan concentrations 
the board of directors reviews management s assessments at least on a quarterly basis 
historically  the company has not generally been an unsecured lender either to businesses or individuals  and most of its loans are secured by some form of collateral 
however  exceptions may be made to this general operating philosophy from time to time 
for most loans  which are collateralized  the primary risk element  other than fraud  relates to the market acceptability and appropriate value of the collateral securing the loans 
commitments 
in the normal course of its business  the company makes commitments to extend credit and issues standby letters of credit 
generally  such commitments are provided by the company as a service to customers with which the company has other relationships 
commitments to extend credit amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
outstanding letters of credit amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
deposits 
one of the primary components of sound growth and profitability is core deposit accumulation and retention 
core deposits consist of all deposits except public funds and certificates of deposit in excess of  since core deposits exclude certificates of deposit issued in excess of  it is the company s general policy to issue such certificates only to customers with which the company has other relationships 
at december   total deposits were approximately million  a decrease of approximately million or from december  the decrease for reflected seasonal fluctuations 
at december   total deposits were approximately million  an increase of approximately million or over year end core deposits as a percentage of total deposits were approximately for and for while the percentage of certificates of deposit in excess of  was and in those respective years

the financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operation of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
the company believes that continuation of its efforts to manage the rates  liquidity and interest sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities is necessary to generate an acceptable return on assets
