in addition  average weekly room rates were positively influenced by the olympic games in atlanta during the quarter ended september  future occupancy and room rates may be impacted by a number of factors including the number and geographic location of new facilities  as well as the season in which such properties commence operations 
there can be no assurance that the foregoing occupancy and room rates can be maintained 
occupancy rates are determined by dividing the guest rooms occupied on a daily basis by the total number of guest rooms 
average weekly room rates are determined by dividing room revenue by the number of rooms occupied on a daily basis for the applicable period and multiplying by seven 
the average weekly room rates vary from standard room rates due primarily to i stays of less than one week  which are charged at a higher nightly rate  ii higher weekly rates for a limited number of rooms which are larger than the standard rooms  and iii additional charges for more than one person per room

the increase in corporate operating and property management expenses for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  reflects an increase in personnel and related expenses in connection with the company s increased level of operating properties and site development 
the total amount of these expenses will increase in the future with the development of additional facilities

the company expects that it will need to procure additional financing over time  although there can be no assurance that such financing will be available when needed 
seasonality and inflation based upon the operating history of the company s facilities  management believes that extended stay lodging facilities are not as seasonal in nature as the overall lodging industry 
management does expect  however  that occupancy and revenues may be lower than average during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year 
because many of the company s expenses do not fluctuate with occupancy  such declines in occupancy may cause fluctuations or decreases in the company s quarterly earnings 
the rate of inflation as measured by changes in the average consumer price index has not had a material effect on the revenue or operating results of the company from its inception on january  there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not affect future operating or construction costs
