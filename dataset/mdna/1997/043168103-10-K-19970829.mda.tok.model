c results of operations comparison of fy with fy sales revenues for fy rose due to the acquisitions described above and returning strength in other areas of our existing business 
sales from the acquisitions exceeded  the feed processing business was up  and sales gains were made in our land maintenance line 
sales declined in the sugar beet equipment line as we deliberately delayed production beyond may  to minimize working capital  make manufacturing room for our new products  and to allow more time for the development of new features 
gross profit for fy rose on the higher sales volume  however fiscal year gross profit was impacted by a  inventory write down 
the ratio of cost of goods sold to net sales improved to from last year s prior to the write down 
this improvement in fy resulted from lower raw material costs and reduced warranty expense 
operating expenses were higher than fy the two acquisitions accounted for most of the increase  which included amortization of purchase costs and additional employees to support the acquisitions 
in addition  the company strengthened our beet equipment resources in the engineering area 
the wage reduction implemented in june was progressively restored which further increased operating expenses 
the ratio of expenses to sales fell from in fy to in fy interest expense was lower in fy when compared to fy improved manufacturing flow reduced working capital requirements throughout the year

operating expenses as a percent of net sales were and in fy and fy the reduction in expenses and improvement in the cost of goods sold percent has enabled the loss from operations to be reduced from fy interest expense fell from fy  as production schedules  inventories and accounts receivable were reduced 
other expenses were up significantly due to fees associated with the new loan agreement 
the effective income tax rate was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year changes in the rate are due almost entirely to research and development credits 
utilization of deferred tax assets in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income  management believes it is more likely than not the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at may  see also note to the consolidated financial statements
