million fewer barrels in as reimbursement of pre commerciality costs related to the cusiana field 
oil and gas sales from properties sold in late and early aggregated million in  compared with million in based on the operator s current projections  the company expects gross production capacity from the fields to reach  barrels per day during summer and at least  barrels per day by the end of beginning in april  the company s delivery requirement under the forward oil sale will increase from  barrels per month to  barrels per month  which will have an adverse effect on the company s earnings and cash flows on a per barrel basis 
the company expects that the adverse effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows will be mitigated by increased production from the fields 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the timing of any such increase in production or that any such increase would occur in the same accounting period as the increase in the company s forward oil sale delivery requirement

shippers of crude oil which are not initial shippers third party shippers will be assessed a tariff on a per barrel basis and ocensa will use revenues from such tariffs to reduce the initial shippers tariff 
the company cannot predict with any certainty the impact of the increased tariff on a per barrel basis due to the uncertainty as to the volumes of the third party shippers production to be transported by ocensa and when the increases in production from the cusiana and cupiagua fields may occur

income taxes statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires that the company make projections about the timing and scope of certain future business transactions in order to estimate recoverability of deferred tax assets primarily resulting from the expected utilization of net operating loss carryforwards nols 
changes in the timing or nature of actual or anticipated business transactions  projections  organizational changes  and income tax laws can give rise to significant adjustments to the company s deferred tax expense or benefit that may be reported from time to time 
for these and other reasons  compliance with sfas may result in significant differences between tax expense for income statement purposes and taxes actually paid 
the income tax provision for represented current and deferred taxes in colombia  deferred taxes on exploration projects throughout the world  and a deferred tax benefit in the united states related to anticipated future utilization of nols 
subject to the factors described above  the company currently expects that its foreign deferred tax provision will substantially exceed its current tax provision ie  actual taxes paid resulting in an effective tax for income statement purposes that will exceed statutory tax rates  at least until the cusiana and cupiagua fields project reaches peak production 
the primary reason for the expected difference is the nondeductibility for colombian tax purposes of certain capital expenses and the treatment of reimbursements for pre commerciality costs as a return of capital under colombian tax laws 
conversely  colombian tax law permits the company to adjust the tax basis of certain assets based on the colombian inflation rate and to include any resulting increases in tax depreciation of the underlying asset based on rates of production and other factors 
the company s deferred tax liability has not been reduced to reflect the impact of this inflation adjustment 
at december   the company had nols of approximately million  and certain subsidiaries had separate return limitation years srly operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the nols expire from to  and the srly operating loss carryforwards expire from to see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded a deferred tax asset of million  net of a valuation allowance of million at december  the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to srly operating losses that are currently not realizable due to the lack of potential future income in the applicable subsidiaries  and the expectation that other tax credits will expire without being utilized 
the minimum amount of future taxable income necessary to realize the deferred tax asset is approximately million 
although there can be no assurance the company will achieve such levels of income  management believes the deferred tax asset will be realized through increasing income from its operations 
the income tax provision for decreased primarily due to the recognition of a deferred tax benefit in the united states totaling million related to anticipated future utilization of nols  compared with a similar benefit of million in the benefit reflects the improvement in the company s anticipated operating results 
foreign current tax expense of million in increased million from  mainly due to increased profitability from the company s colombian operations 
foreign deferred tax expense of million in decreased million from  primarily due to the writedown of the company s argentina assets  which lowered taxes by million in compared with year ended december   compared with year ended december  revenues sales and other operating revenues were million and million in and  respectively 
revenues in colombia increased by million in primarily due to greater production capacity from the installation in late and early of four production units in the cusiana central processing facility and higher oil prices in colombia per barrel in  compared with per barrel in resulting from more favorable market conditions and batching of cusiana crude beginning in mid the results also included revenues of million relating to the reimbursement of pre commerciality costs for the cusiana field 
oil sales in france were million higher in than in  primarily because of the sale of triton france in august costs and expenses operating expenses increased million to million in  while depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million to million in higher production in colombia increased operating expenses by million and depreciation  depletion and amortization by million 
the company s operating costs per equivalent barrel were and in and  respectively 
the sale of triton france reduced operating expenses and depletion in by million and million  respectively 
the results included an accrual of million for environmental clean up costs in the united states 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to increased capitalization of general and administrative expenses from million in to million in resulting from increased exploration and development activities 
writedown of assets in totaling million was primarily related to oil properties in france under application of the securities and exchange commission full cost ceiling limitation 
other income and expenses interest income was million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense increased by million in due to higher debt outstanding and lower capitalized interest 
capitalized interest was million and million in and  respectively 
equity in loss of affiliates  net was million in  compared with million in equity in loss of crusader for included a net gain of million on the sale of saracen minerals limited  a million loss related to the early redemption of crusader s convertible notes and writedowns of million on unproved oil and gas properties and a coal mining property 
other income  net was million in  compared with million in other income during included million received from legal settlements  a million gain on the sale of triton france and million received from the early redemption of crusader s convertible notes 
these gains were offset by a million noncash charge representing the change in fair market value of wti benchmark call options purchased in income taxes income tax expense of million in increased million from  mainly due to increased profitability from the company s colombian operations and the absence of tax refunds of million received in the income tax provisions for and included deferred tax benefits in the united states of million and million  respectively  related to anticipated future utilization of nols 
discontinued operations the results of operations for the aviation sales and services segment and wholesale fuel products segment have been reported as discontinued operations 
in june  the company sold the assets of its subsidiary  jet east  inc  for million in cash and a note  and realized a loss of million on the sale 
the company accrued 
million for costs associated with final disposal of the segment  which occurred in august the losses of the wholesale fuel products segment  which was discontinued in  were offset against a loss provision of million  net of tax  at may  an additional accrual of 
million  net of tax  was recorded at may   for estimated operating losses associated with the final disposition of this segment 
minority interest in losses of subsidiaries the company ceased to record minority interest related to triton europe following the purchase of shares held by the minority interest owners on march  petroleum price risk management oil and natural gas sold by the company are normally priced with reference to a defined benchmark  such as light sweet crude oil traded on the new york mercantile exchange 
actual prices received vary from the benchmark depending on quality and location differentials 
it is the company s policy to use financial market transactions with credit worthy counterparties from time to time primarily to reduce risk associated with the pricing of a portion of the oil and natural gas that it sells 
the policy is structured to underpin the company s planned revenues and results of operations 
the company may also enter into financial market transactions to benefit from its assessment of the future prices of its production relative to other benchmark prices 
there can be no assurance that the use of financial market transactions will not result in losses 
with respect to the sale of oil to be produced by the company  the company has used a combination of swaps  options and collars to establish a minimum weighted average wti benchmark price of per barrel for an aggregate of million barrels of production during the period from january through june as a result  to the extent wti prices exceed the minimum wti benchmark price during each month within the period  the company will be able to sell its production at the higher market price  and to the extent that wti prices are below the minimum wti benchmark price  the company will be able to realize prices related to the minimum wti benchmark price on its hedged production 
in anticipation of entering into a forward oil sale  the company purchased wti benchmark call options to retain the ability to benefit from future wti price increases above a weighted average price of per barrel 
the volumes and expiration dates on the call options coincide with the volumes and delivery dates of the forward oil sale  which has delivery terms of  barrels per month through march and  barrels per month from april through march during the years ended december  and  the company recorded an unrealized gain of million and an unrealized loss of million  respectively  in other income  net related to the change in the fair market value of the call options 
future fluctuations in the fair market value of the call options will continue to affect other income as noncash adjustments 
during the year ended december   markets provided the company the opportunity to realize wti benchmark oil prices on average per barrel above the wti benchmark oil price the company set as part of its annual plan 
as a result of financial and commodity market transactions settled during the year ended december   the company s risk management program resulted in an average net realization of approximately per barrel lower than if the company had not entered into such transactions 
international operations the company derives substantially all of its consolidated revenues from international operations 
a risk inherent in international operations is the possibility of realizing economic currency exchange losses when transactions are completed in currencies other than us dollars 
the company s risk of realizing currency exchange losses currently is largely mitigated because the company receives us dollars for sales of its petroleum products in colombia 
exploration operations costs related to acquisition  holding and initial exploration of licenses in countries with no proved reserves are initially capitalized  including internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the company s exploration licenses are periodically assessed for impairment on a country by country basis 
if the company s investment in exploration licenses within a country where no proved reserves are assigned is deemed to be impaired  the licenses are written down to estimated recoverable value 
if the company abandons all exploration efforts in a country where no proved reserves are assigned  all exploration costs associated with the country are expensed 
due to the unpredictable nature of exploration drilling activities  the amount and timing of impairment expense are difficult to predict with any certainty 
environmental matters the company is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations 
these laws regulate the discharge of oil  gas or other materials into the environment and may require the company to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of such materials at various sites 
also  the company remains liable for certain environmental matters that may arise from formerly owned fuel businesses that were involved in the storage  handling and sale of hazardous materials  including fuel storage in underground tanks 
the company believes that the level of future expenditures for environmental matters  including clean up obligations  is impractical to determine with a precise and reliable degree of accuracy 
management believes that such costs  when finally determined  will not have a material  adverse effect on the company s operations or consolidated financial condition
