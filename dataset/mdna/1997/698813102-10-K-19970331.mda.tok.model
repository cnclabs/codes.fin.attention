item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction papa john s international  inc the company began operations in with the opening of the first papa john s restaurant in jeffersonville  indiana 
at december   there were  papa john s restaurants in operation  consisting of company owned and franchised restaurants 
the company s revenues are principally derived from sales by company owned restaurants  franchise royalties  franchise and development fees  sales of food and paper products to franchisees  sales of restaurant equipment and printing and promotional items principally to franchisees and information systems sales and related services provided to franchisees 
the company intends to continue to expand the number of company owned and franchised restaurants 
the company s expansion strategy is to cluster restaurants in targeted markets  thereby increasing consumer awareness and enabling the company to take advantage of operational  distribution and advertising efficiencies 
the company believes that its expansion strategy has contributed to increases in comparable annual sales for company owned restaurants of in  in and in the company anticipates that future comparable sales increases  if any  will be at a lesser rate than in recent periods 
average sales for company owned restaurants open a full year increased to  for from  for this increase is attributable to continuing strong sales of maturing stores and to the fact that several new markets were entered in  with generally lower sales volumes throughout as those markets were built out 
average sales volumes in new markets are generally lower than in those markets in which the company has established a significant market position  although recent trends indicate that new markets are opening with stronger than historical sales volumes 
approximately of the company s revenues for and for were derived from the sale to franchisees of food and paper products  restaurant equipment  printing and promotional items and information systems equipment and software and related services by the company  its commissary subsidiary  pj food service  inc  and the company s support services subsidiary  printing promotions  inc the company believes that  in addition to supporting both company and franchised growth  these subsidiaries contribute to product quality and consistency throughout the papa john s system

during and  the company pursued a greater number of free standing locations and expects to continue this strategy in the average cash investment for the company owned restaurants opened during  exclusive of land and pre opening costs  increased to approximately  from  for the units opened in this increase was primarily due to higher average costs of free standing units and increased signage and leasehold improvement costs 
the company expects the average cash investment for restaurants opening in to approximate  although there can be no assurance that actual costs will not exceed this amount 
the primary reason for the projected increase in average cash investment for restaurant openings is an increase in the percentage of planned free standing units in pre opening costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over a period of one year from the opening date of the restaurant or commissary facility 
the company does not expect the adoption of proposed new accounting guidance requiring that pre opening costs be expensed as incurred to significantly impact future operating income due to the relative consistency of new facility openings and length of the current amortization period 
the company defers certain costs incurred in connection with the development of its information systems and amortizes such costs over periods of up to five years from the date of completion
