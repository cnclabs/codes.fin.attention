item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets products based on its proprietary interface technologies  which allows most standard wireline customer premises equipment phones  facsimile machines  computer modems  pbxs  and key systems  among others to operate over wireless telecommunications networks 
currently  the company is devoting a substantial portion of its resources to international market development  extension of its core product line to new wireless standards  expansion  protection and licensing of its intellectual property rights  and development of underlying radio technology 
the company s operating expense levels are based in large part on expectations of future revenues 
if anticipated sales in any quarter do not occur as expected  expenditure and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and the company s operating results for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  could be adversely affected 
certain factors that could significantly impact expected results are described in cautionary statements pursuant to the securities litigation reform act which is an exhibit to this form k 
overview the company has seen substantial growth in the market for fwts in both wll and waa systems 
the company encountered heightened activity during fiscal that gives it reason to believe that the fwt market is maturing beyond the nascent stage 
the company quoted more contracts  shipped more product more than fiscal and observed more data that confirmed momentum in the fwt market than during any previous period 
the major trends driving the market include a broad consumer acceptance of cellular communications  rapid privatization of telecommunications in developed and developing countries  adoption of digital wireless transmission standards that enhance network capacity and service  service network providers acceptance of fwts as cost effective answers to customer demand for improved telecommunications and pcs licensing that will drive down the price of wireless communications and expand the number of users within the us if these trends continue  they will provide significant international and domestic opportunities 
wll  which is the core of the company s fwt business in developing countries  involves cellular infrastructure employed predominately and sometimes exclusively for the fixed location user 
continued growth of the wll market depends primarily on the pricing of wll airtime service to the customer relative to available wireline prices  the relative local availability of wll and wireline service  operator regulatory constraints on fixed cellular  and money available in a given country 
these factors have contributed to the increase in the number of new wll networks commissioned in compared with the previous year 
because fwt deployment lags network commissioning  the company believes the pent up opportunity is even larger as fwt deployment materializes on the networks previously commissioned 
waa  which represents the majority of the company s sales in developed countries  has primarily involved wireless back up of existing wireline systems and where wireline service is unavailable or unreliable  using mobile cellular networks built primarily for handheld cellular phone users 
management anticipates that additional fwt markets for waa applications will develop as existing cellular networks mature and new networks and services are introduced 
as capacity and price competition increase on new and existing cellular networks and the growth rate in new cellular phone subscribers slows  mobile cellular operators will be forced to look for new revenue sources 
fwts provide an excellent opportunity for cellular network operators as they are less costly to support than mobile units permanently linked to a specific cell site  generate more average airtime and operate mainly at off peak times 
the number of fwts presently operating on waa networks exceeds that of wll and is driven by the relative price for airtime  as well as by the large installed base of mobile networks worldwide 
the company has a number of undertakings which embody its strategy to capitalize on the growth it anticipates for fwts 
the company added new personnel in each of its international sales offices and will continue to strengthen and build its sales and marketing organizations 
the company s product development program is designed to result in a line of fwts over the next two years that will address the cellular radio standards projected to serve of all cellular subscribers in the year in fiscal  the company raised approximately million of capital  most of which will be used for product development purposes 
the company also consolidated and upgraded its manufacturing facilities in order to increase working efficiencies between functions  improve quality  modernize equipment  increase capacity and facilitate the introduction of new products 
during fiscal  the company s fwts gained market position on the following major radio standards analog while the overall fwt market is shifting from analog cellular to digital cellular  there are many analog opportunities 
analog is sometimes used to meet regulatory deadlines on new wll deployments in which the new digital infrastructure cannot be deployed fast enough 
also  when new digital mobile networks are installed in urban areas  the older analog infrastructure often is displaced and then redeployed for wll use in the surrounding suburban area 
the company is the original supplier of analog fwts and one of the few remaining analog suppliers  enabling it to capture a sizeable share of all new analog fwt business worldwide 
digital gsm despite the historical importance of analog  most planned fwt deployment in both wll and waa markets will be on one of the various digital standards gsm  cdma  or tdma 
digital is more desirable than analog because it provides superior capacity  voice privacy  higher transmission rates for fax and data  and additional user services such as caller id and messaging 
the company s new gsm fwt was introduced during fiscal it should allow the company to capture a fair share of the growth in the digital market 
the company plans to introduce five new fwts in fiscal these include one analog fwt the sx amps  and four digital fwts the sx tdma  the sx cdma  the sx dcs and the sx gsm all of these will operate from a common hardware software platform  will cost less to make and will have more features than the present versions 
the company spotted the beginning of a new trend in the wll market during the year 
previously  most fwts used in wll networks were sold by infrastructure manufacturers who bundled the fwt infrastructure for sale to the wll operator 
now  however  more savvy operators are buying infrastructure and fwts separately 
the company already has realized the initial benefits of this trend with major new contracts with operators to supply fwts in the philippines and guinea 
having reversed its strategy of not licensing its intellectual property in fiscal  the company has been negotiating licenses with a number of large international telecommunications companies 
the company has agreed to provide component circuit boards to qualcomm incorporated 
in october   the company signed a memorandum of understanding with ericcson radio systems ab to license certain of its technology for use in ericcson products 
it is inevitable in growing markets with huge potential that competition will increase 
accordingly  a few infrastructure suppliers introduced fwts during the year 
the company believes its advantages over industry competition include better focus commitment in the wll market  the company s only business is fwts 
most often  competitors sell fwts to support their infrastructure business 
more experience the company has been in the fwt business for eleven years 
broader product line the company offer fwts that operate on all major non proprietary radio standards 
restructuring and organizational changes on january   the company announced a restructuring program the restructuring program which was implemented during the second and third quarters of fiscal the difficulty in predicting demand for the company s products  due in part to immature foreign markets  underscored the importance of properly aligning costs and expenses to attainable levels of revenue 
manufacturing and engineering consolidation  outsourcing and the elimination of non core product lines were the focus of the restructuring 
the company s puerto rico and buffalo grove manufacturing operations were phased out during the second fiscal quarter of fiscal  and production was consolidated at the company s atlanta  georgia facility apart from the restructuring  the company further consolidated and moved its offices and operations to vernon hills  illinois during 
the restructuring program reduced general  administrative and manufacturing costs company wide 
the number of employees decreased from over to during fiscal restructuring and impairment charges were incurred during the second and third quarters of fiscal restructuring charges were approximately million and consisted of intangible  inventory and fixed asset write offs as well as severance payments to employees separated from the company 
the company will experience approximately million in reduced amortization charges in each of the next five years as the result of intangible assets written off as restructuring or impairment charges 
in addition  impairment charges of million were recorded  which represented specific intangibles that were determined to be impaired based on estimated cash flows over the remaining business life cycle of the related assets 
events related to a change in management and the corresponding change in business direction  and the restructuring plan prompted the evaluation of these intangibles 
consolidation of manufacturing the company signed a lease in december for a  square foot facility located in vernon hills  illinois  which is in the metropolitan chicago area 
during fiscal  the company consolidated most operations  excluding certain sales offices  into the vernon hills facility 
this move situated engineering  marketing and manufacturing resources in close proximity to one another 
this effort has increased the overall quality of manufactured products and will speed the delivery of new products to market 
sales and marketing the company strengthened and rebuilt its sales and marketing organizations in fiscal the company s sales increased during fiscal see results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal
