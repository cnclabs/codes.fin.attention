certain statements in this form k  particularly those set forth in item and in this item  constitute forward looking statements  including  without limitation  those relating to i future income from discontinued operations  ii the company s plan to seek to identify suitable businesses  products  technologies and companies for acquisition  iii the stockholder litigation currently pending against the company and iv the company s obligations under an existing warranty agreement 
the company is subject to all of the risks and uncertainties inherent in a corporation that has discontinued substantially all of its operations  as well as other known and unknown risks  uncertainties and contingencies  including  without limitation  i the inability of thermatrix to sell substantial amounts of padre equipment  ii company management s inability to identify candidates for acquisition  to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms or to operate profitably following the consummation of any acquisition  iii adverse litigation outcomes and iv unexpected warranty claims  many of which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
in april  the company consummated the sale of substantially all of its noncash assets  excluding inventory  to thermatrix in consideration for a cash payment of  and royalties in the amount of seven percent of the net invoice value of thermatrix padre equipment sales 
in addition  thermatrix agreed to take possession of the company s remaining inventory on a consignment basis 
accordingly  the company does not believe that its results of operations from prior periods  in particular  fiscal year  are indicative of future performance 
see item business 
the company has incurred cumulative net losses of approximately  from inception to december  the company does not expect to be profitable unless and until such time as it acquires a new business  product  technology or company and only then if such acquisition is successful and on favorable terms 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve profitability 
results of continuing operations for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  the company had no revenues from continuing operations in fiscal years  and general and administrative expenses from continuing operations of the company consisted of general corporate administration expenses  costs associated with the company s reporting and disclosure obligations as a public company  directors and officers insurance and similar items 
these expenses were approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in such expenses from fiscal year to fiscal year was principally due to reductions in personnel and related costs as a result of the discontinuation of the company s principal operations 
the increase in such expenses from fiscal year to fiscal year was principally attributable to costs related to the stockholder action filed against the company in july see item legal proceedings 
interest income in fiscal years   and was approximately   and  respectively  resulted from the investment of the net proceeds of the company s initial public offering in into short term  liquid cash equivalents 
interest income in fiscal year is lower than fiscal years and due to a reduction in the company s cash and short term investments which were used to fund operating losses from continuing operations  and to pay accrued warranty and legal expenses from discontinued operations 
interest income will likely continue to decrease if additional cash or short term investments are used to fund operating losses and accrued expenses  or if interest rates decline 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company s net loss from continuing operations was approximately  in fiscal year as compared to a net loss of  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year results of discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  revenues from discontinued operations in fiscal year of approximately  consisted of royalty payments  inventory purchases by thermatrix in connection with the asset sale  and revenues from customer services provided by the company on padre systems not sold to thermatrix 
the company expects to continue to have some royalties and other revenue for the first two quarters of fiscal year as a result of thermatrix sale of a large padre system in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and that the amount of such revenue will decline thereafter 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to generate any future revenue related to the asset sale 
the company s revenues of approximately  and  for fiscal years and  respectively  were principally from the shipment and rental of padre systems 
the company recorded no research and development  sales  marketing  or general and administrative expenses from discontinued operations in fiscal year the company performed services provided for under certain warranty obligations during fiscal year which were accrued in fiscal year as part of the provision for discontinued operations 
manufacturing expenses from discontinued operations  which were essentially all related to the production of padre systems  decreased to approximately  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the decline from fiscal year resulted from reduced product shipments in fiscal year and to inventory write downs that were taken in fiscal year but were partly offset by larger warranty provisions in research and development expenses of discontinued operations for fiscal year were approximately  as compared to  in fiscal year the decrease in such expenses reflect the termination of research projects not directly related to the padre product line in late and of essentially all other research and development in fiscal year research and development expenses consisted primarily of salaries and benefits  supplies and materials and fees paid to outside consultants 
sales  marketing and service expenses of discontinued operations in fiscal year decreased to approximately  from  in fiscal year the decrease principally reflects the personnel reductions made in late  and additional personnel cuts in fiscal year  as well as approximately  in bad debt expenses for fiscal year general and administrative expenses of discontinued operations for fiscal year were approximately  as compared to approximately  in fiscal year the decrease from fiscal year to is due to reduction in payroll and employee benefits and to the closure of the company s european office in late discontinued general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of payroll and related costs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  when the company discontinued its operations  it included provisions for the write down of inventory and fixed assets  for the costs of employee termination  for anticipated warranty expenditures over the remaining life of padre installations and for the operating losses of the discontinued operations 
the net liabilities of the discontinued operations were approximately  as of december  and approximately  as of december  the decrease in net liabilities of discontinued operations of approximately  from december  to december  resulted from the company s payment of expenses associated with the costs of employee termination and warranty expenditures for padre systems and reduction of the overall accrual for the cost of discontinued operations 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company s net income from discontinued operations was approximately  in fiscal year as compared to a net loss of approximately  in fiscal year and  for fiscal year the company s future utilization of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes is limited as a result of successive changes of ownership that occurred between and future changes in ownership could further restrict the company s ability to use its net loss carryforwards 
further  if the company failed to continue its business enterprise for a period of two years following an ownership change  the net operating loss carryforwards could be forfeited 
see note of notes to financial statements 
net income net loss from continuing and discontinued operations as a result of the foregoing factors  the company s net income from both continuing and discontinued operations was approximately  in fiscal year  as compared to net losses of approximately  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had working capital of approximately  as compared to approximately  at december  working capital as of both dates consisted substantially of short term investments  cash and cash equivalents  accrued liabilities  and net liabilities from discontinued operations 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately  in fiscal year  and  in fiscal year although the company s most significant assets consist largely of cash and cash equivalents  the company has no intent to become  or hold itself out to be  engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting  or trading in securities 
accordingly  the company does not anticipate being required to register pursuant to the investment company act of and expects to be limited in its ability to invest in securities  other than cash equivalents and government securities  in the aggregate amount of over of its assets 
there can be no assurances that any investment made by the company will not result in losses 
management believes that the company has sufficient cash and short term investments to meet the anticipated needs of the company s continuing and discontinued operations through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances to that effect  as the company has no assurance of significant revenues and is subject to numerous contingent liabilities which could result in the depletion of its capital  including  without limitation i any damages awarded and or costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with pending and threatened litigation against the company  in particular the currently pending stockholder action see item legal proceedings  and ii its obligations and liabilities under an outstanding warranty and service agreement 
judgments or settlements against the company in connection with such litigation could exceed the company s insurance coverage and require the company to use its limited capital resources in satisfaction thereof 
in addition  the company may require outside advisors to assist management in seeking and evaluating potential acquisitions  in consummating such transactions and or in managing the resulting enterprises 
in the event that the company has not reserved sufficient cash for i its obligations under warranty and service agreements  ii costs and expenses relating to pending or threatened litigation or iii the acquisition of a particular business  product or technology  the company may require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing would be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all 
the company does not presently have a line of credit or other bank credit facility
