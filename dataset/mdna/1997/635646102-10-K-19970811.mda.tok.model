sherwood securities  ndb s  equitrade s  anvil s and shd s excess net capital are deemed adequate by management for their present operations and currently anticipated future expansion 
effects of inflation the company s assets are not significantly affected by inflation because they are primarily monetary in nature 
management believes that replacement costs of furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements will not materially affect operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects the company s principal expenses such as employee benefits and compensation  rent and communication  which may not be readily recoverable from increased revenues 
due to market forces and competitive conditions in the securities industry  a broker dealer may be unable to unilaterally increase spreads and commissions in order to recover increased costs related to inflation 
consequently  the company must rely on increased volume for this purpose 
however  the company has significant cash balances on deposit with its principal clearing broker which  in the event there are higher interest rates  would offset some of the costs
