results of operations the following table sets forth summary operating information for the company for the years ended march   and decreases in casino revenues in metropolis and lake charles in as compared to  were primarily the result of additional competition  although metropolis business was also adversely impacted in march  by a flood along the ohio river 
a competitor of metropolis  located in evansville  indiana which commenced operations in december   significantly upgraded its riverboat and land based casino complex during the upgrades  which became operational in december   included the addition of a hotel and a large parking garage 
in addition  a large casino resort in tunica  mississippi  which opened in june   actively sought customers in the southern illinois and western kentucky areas in which the company operates 
in lake charles  a competitor opened an additional riverboat in july  whereas through june  the company operated two of a total of three licensed riverboats in lake charles constituting approximately of available gaming capacity  it now operates two of four licensed riverboats  or approximately of available gaming capacity 
the additional competition resulted in both lower passenger counts and volumes of play in both metropolis and lake charles 
to counter the capacity dilution and additional competition for patrons  the house advantages on both table games and slot machines were reduced 
thus  revenues were negatively affected by both less play and lower hold percentages on reduced volume 
mesquite operated for the full year in versus approximately nine months in and casino revenues increased proportionately 
non casino revenues in mesquite also increased in as a result of the opening of an hole golf course in october  maryland heights opened on march   and thus contributed revenues for the three weeks ended march  the increase in both casino and total revenues in compared to reflects the openings by the company of a second riverboat casino in lake charles in april  and a land based casino resort in mesquite in june   and replacement of the original metropolis riverboat with one having more gaming capacity in november  the decreases in operating income in metropolis and lake charles in as compared to were principally due to decreased casino revenue coupled with additional spending on advertising  marketing  promotions and entertainment 
such expenditures increased by approximately in metropolis and in lake charles in from lake charles non marketing related operating expenses were also approximately higher in than in  due to a full year of operation of an expanded facility  including the players island entertainment and dining barge which opened in february  mesquite s operating loss was reduced in it operated for the entire year compared to only nine months in  and an hole golf course was opened at the resort in october income from the golf course and resultant increased hotel occupancy and average room rate  reduced the overall operating loss 
maryland heights operating loss includes the company s casino operations and pre opening costs together with the company s share in the operations of the joint venture as follows in  the company contributed land with a carrying value of  to the maryland heights joint venture 
the land was originally purchased as a potential gaming site for the company 
in the fourth quarter of  an audit of the joint venture was completed which included an appraisal of the land determining its fair market value to be  this value was used as the basis for recording the contribution of the land in the joint venture records 
as a result  the company reduced its investment in the joint venture by  in the fourth quarter of the reduction in value of the land by the joint venture did not affect the interest the company holds in the joint venture 
during the fourth quarter of  the company reevaluated its decision to remain in the mesquite market due primarily to continuing losses at that facility and as a result  entered into an asset purchase agreement in february  to sell substantially all of the mesquite operating assets to rgb  llc rgb 
due to the need for rgb to be licensed by the state of nevada to operate the property as a gaming establishment  it was agreed that the sale would be consummated in two parts 
the first part  effective march   involved the transfer of most of the real property  inventory and non gaming equipment for million in cash 
the second part  scheduled to close on june   will include the gaming equipment and the remaining furniture  equipment and other assets as defined in the agreement  for million in cash and a two year promissory note for million

 sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
during the fourth quarter of  the company re evaluated its investment in players bluegrass downs and committed to a plan to remove from service and replace the entertainment and dining barge utilized by metropolis 
prior to and since the company s acquisition of players bluegrass downs in  the state of kentucky has considered a variety of proposals to expand the types of gaming allowed in the state 
such proposals included allowing the operators of licensed racetracks to operate electronic gaming devices on site 
the company originally acquired players bluegrass downs for its strategic and development potential if suitable enabling legislation were to be signed into law 
the most recent legislative session concluded without any such legislation being enacted 
the company has incurred losses operating players bluegrass downs since its acquisition and believes that in the absence of additional forms of gaming at the facility operating losses will continue 
as a result  the company has determined that its investment in bluegrass downs is impaired 
in accordance with sfas  impairment losses for players bluegrass downs and the metropolis barge totaling million were recorded in the year ended march corporate and other non operating costs decreased in versus principally due to the curtailment of development activities with a concomitant decline in legal  consulting and other professional fees  travel and personnel relocation expenses 
this was partially offset by the write off of million of unamortized loan costs related to the original bank credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the restructuring charge in reflects the company s decision to significantly reduce its pursuit of development opportunities in new or emerging jurisdictions and instead concentrate on improving its existing operations 
this resulted in the sale of assets used in development activities or held for future development and a significant downsizing of management and staff 
the non recurring charge consists of the net loss on disposal of assets and the cost of employee severance arrangements 
in july   the first competing riverboat in lake charles opened and the coushatta indian tribe s land based casino  located approximately minutes away  was expanded 
to compete with the additional gaming capacity  the company increased its spending on promotional allowances  advertising and marketing and made significant capital improvements to the lake charles facility see investments  divestitures and capital expenditures

the operating loss in mesquite in was due to poor operating results at the facility which resulted in a significant shortfall in actual versus projected casino revenues

during  the star riverboat in lake charles was brought on line  the players hotel was purchased and the entertainment  dining barge and parking garage were constructed and opened 
in addition  the mesquite facility was completed and opened and construction commenced in maryland heights 
capitalized interest totaled million in and million in non capitalized interest expense  net of interest income  increased in versus as a result of additional borrowings under the bank credit facility and the liquidation of all remaining marketable securities to fund the capital investment required in maryland heights 
non capitalized interest expense increased in versus primarily due to the issuance of the senior notes in april interest income increased in versus as a result of the short term investment of the proceeds of the senior note issuance

the following table summarizes the above and all other sources and uses of capital for the past three years liquidity and capital resources in august   the company entered into a million revolving credit agreement credit facility with a consortium of banks banks 
the credit facility contained restrictive covenants including minimum rolling four quarters ebitda  as defined in the credit facility 
as of september   the company advised the banks of an event of default with respect to the minimum ebitda covenant for the four quarters then ended 
following a waiver from the banks of the event of default the company and the banks reached an agreement that revised the terms of the credit facility the revised credit facility which included an increase in the loan interest rate 
certain of the terms of the revised credit facility were further amended in march in connection with the sale of mesquite 
the total credit line was reduced from million to million as of the date of the first closing on the mesquite sale and will be further reduced to million on june   million on september   million on december   and million on march  the remaining commitment of million will expire on june  at march   million was outstanding under the revised credit facility at an interest rate of prime plus 
the interest rate will increase by per quarter beginning october  in addition to a rolling four quarters minimum ebitda requirement  the revised credit agreement added minimum quarterly non cumulative ebitda requirements as follows quarter ended minimum ebitda requirement march  million june  million september  million december  million march  million the company met the ebitda requirement for the quarter ended march   and is confident that  based on operating results through may   it will exceed the requirement for the quarter ending june  based on the operating budget for fiscal  the company believes that it will also meet or exceed the minimum requirement for each of the other three quarters 
in light of the competitive environment in which the company operates  however  such attainment is not guaranteed and it is possible that an event of default could occur if operating results are significantly below budget 
the company expects to receive a federal tax refund of approximately million during the quarter ending september  in connection with the receipt of these funds and their possible utilization to further reduce outstanding borrowings under the revised credit facility  the company anticipates commencing negotiations with the banks and or other lenders to refinance the remaining borrowings under the revised credit facility 
if the company fails to meet any covenant under the revised credit facility  the lender may  at its option  give notice that amounts owed are immediately due and payable 
accelerated maturity of the revised credit facility would require management to complete a restructuring or refinancing of the revised credit facility or implement actions to obtain cash from other sources to repay the revised credit facility 
management believes it is capable of completing a restructuring or refinancing of amounts currently outstanding and that failure to meet any covenant will not have a material adverse affect on the accompanying financial statements 
as of may   the company had fully funded its contractual capital obligations with respect to the maryland heights joint venture 
the company expects to use a significant portion of the approximately million cash proceeds from the second mesquite closing to reduce outstanding borrowings under the revised credit facility 
the company believes that expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements for current operations and debt service not otherwise funded through march  at the present time  other than the replacement of the entertainment and dining barge at metropolis  no major capital projects are contemplated for forward looking information certain information included in this section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k contains  and other materials filed or to be filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by the company contain or will contain or include  forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended
