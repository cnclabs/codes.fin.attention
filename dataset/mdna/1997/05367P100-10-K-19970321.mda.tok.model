international sales sales to customers outside north america accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues compared to approximately for and for international sales increased by in compared to and in compared to the increase in international sales in was attributable primarily to higher unit sales of media composer and pro tools product lines in europe 
the increase in international sales in compared to was primarily due to continued sales growth in europe and japan  in addition to the sales growth in locations where the company established new sales subsidiaries in  which included singapore and australia  and the march acquisition of parallax software limited 
gross profit cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the acquisition of components  the assembly  test  and distribution of finished products  provisions for inventory obsolescence  warehousing  shipping  and post sales customer support costs 
the resulting gross profit fluctuates based on factors such as the mix of products sold  the cost and proportion of third party hardware included in the systems sold by the company  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  the offering of product upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs and sales of aftermarket hardware products 
gross margin decreased to in compared to in and from in the decrease in largely reflects the effects of upgrading media composer systems for use on pci based computers  an increase in manufacturing overhead associated with higher facility  information system and customer support costs allocated to costs of revenues 
in addition  the company s decrease in gross margin in resulted from increased provisions for inventory obsolescence  the fourth quarter non cash charge of million related principally to spare parts which are no longer required to support the company s business  and the recognition of approximately million of revenue from the sale of certain server based broadcast products at a relatively low gross margin 
the decrease in gross margin in compared to was primarily due to a further increased proportion of sales of lower margin systems in the second half of  increased sales of third party hardware to the company s distributors  expansion of the company s manufacturing infrastructure  growth in the company s post sales support organizations  and increased proportion of hardware associated with additional functionality in certain of the company s systems 
the company expects that gross margins during to be slightly above levels  but will continue to be lower than and gross margins 
research and development research and development expenses increased million from to and increased million from to these increases were primarily due to the continued development of new and existing products 
the expenses are net of million of payments received during under certain development agreements with third parties 
research and development expenses increased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in and in due to significant resources required to develop and maintain various existing products  including the pci versions of the media composer and pro tools products  mcxpress product lines  newsroom computer systems  video processing hardware  and the camcutter product 
the company capitalized software development costs of approximately  net of write offs  million  million and million in   and  respectively 
this represents  and of total research and development costs during   and  respectively 
these costs will be amortized into cost of revenues over the estimated life of the related products  generally to months 
amortization  net of write offs totaled approximately million  million  and  in   and  respectively

the company s operating activities generated cash of million in compared to using cash of million in cash was generated during the twelve months ended december  primarily from reductions in accounts receivable and inventory 
in  the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to improved collections while the reduction in inventory resulted from improved stock turns and the write off of inventory no longer required to support the company s business 
the company purchased million of property and equipment and other assets during  compared to million in these purchases included primarily the purchase of equipment for hardware and software for the company s information systems and equipment to support research and development activities 
the company had an equipment financing arrangement with a bank which expired on march  in  the company entered into an unsecured line of credit agreement with a group of banks which provided for up to  in revolving credit 
the original expiration date of june  has been extended to june  under the terms of the agreement  as amended in june  the company may borrow up to  the company must pay a quarterly commitment fee calculated based on the debt service ratio of the company and ranges from 
to 
on the  line 
the interest rate to be paid on any outstanding borrowings is contingent upon the financial performance of the company and ranges from libor plus to libor plus 
additionally  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and covenants over the life of the agreement  including a restriction on the payment of dividends 
the company has in certain prior periods been in default of certain financial covenants 
on these occasions the defaults have been waived by the banks 
there can be no assurance that the company will not default in future periods or that  if in default  it will be able to obtain such waivers 
the company had no borrowings against the line and was not in default of any financial covenants as of december  the company believes existing cash and marketable securities  internally generated funds and available borrowings under its bank credit line will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements  including capital expenditures  at least through the end of in the event the company requires additional financing the company believes that it would be able to obtain such financing  however  there can be no assurance that it would be successful in doing so  or that it could do so on terms favorable to the company 
certain factors that may affect future results a number of uncertainties exist that could affect the company s future operating results  including  without limitation  the following the company s gross margin has fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate  based on factors such as the mix of products sold  cost and the proportion of third party hardware included in the systems sold by the company  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  the offering of product and platform upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  the volume of sales of aftermarket hardware products  the costs of swapping or fixing products released to the market with errors or flaws  provisions for inventory obsolescence  allocations of overhead costs to manufacturing and customer support costs to cost of goods  sales of third party computer hardware to its distributors  and competitive pressure on selling prices of products 
the company s systems and software products typically have higher gross margins than storage devices and product upgrades 
gross profit varies from product to product depending primarily on the proportion and cost of third party hardware included in each product 
the company  from time to time  adds functionality and features to its systems 
if such additions are accomplished through the use of more  or more costly  third party hardware  and if the company does not increase the price of such systems to offset these increased costs  the company s gross margins on such systems would be adversely affected 
the company has recently initiated steps designed to shift an increasing proportion of its sales through indirect channels such as distributors and resellers 
the company expects that this shift will result in an increase in the number of software and circuit board kits sold through indirect channels in comparison with turnkey systems consisting of cpus  monitors  and peripheral devices including accompanying software and circuit boards sold by the company through its direct sales force to customers 
therefore  to the extent the company increases its sales through indirect channels  its revenue per unit sale will be less than it would have been had the same sale been made directly by the company 
in the event the company is unable to increase the volume of sales in order to offset this decrease in revenue per sale or is unable to reduce its costs associated with such sales  profits could be adversely affected 
in  the company shipped server based  all digital broadcast newsroom systems to a limited number of beta sites 
these systems incorporate a variety of the company s products  as well as a significant amount of hardware purchased from third parties  including computers purchased from silicon graphics  inc sgi 
because some of the technology and products in these systems were new and untested in live broadcast environments  the company provided greater than normal discounts to these initial customers 
in addition  because some of the technology and products in these systems were new and untested in live broadcast environments  the company has incurred unexpected delays and greater than expected costs in completing and supporting these initial installations to customers satisfaction 
as a result  the company expects that it will report  in the aggregate  a loss on these sales  when all revenues and costs are recognized 
in  the company recognized approximately million in revenues from three of these initial installations and approximately million of related costs 
in future quarters  the company expects to recognize an additional million in revenues associated with the remaining initial installations 
the company has provided a reserve for estimated costs in excess of anticipated revenues 
revenues and costs are recognized upon acceptance of the systems by customers 
the company is unable to determine whether and when the systems will be accepted 
there can be no assurance that the remaining initial installations will be accepted by customers or that the company will not incur further costs in completing the installations 
if customers do not accept these systems  the company could face additional costs associated with reducing the value of the inventory included in the systems 
the company s overall gross margin percentage will be reduced in any quarter or quarters in which the remaining initial installations are recognized or written off 
in  the company installed additional server based  all digital broadcast newsroom systems at other customer sites 
the company believes that such installations  when and if fully recognized as revenue on customer acceptance  would be profitable 
however  the company is unable to determine whether and when the systems will be accepted 
in any event  the company believes that because of the high proportion of third party hardware  including computers and storage devices  included in such systems  that the gross margins on such sales would be lower than the gross margins generally on the company s other systems 
the company s operating expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations of future revenues 
in recent quarters  or more of the company s revenues for a quarter have been recorded in the third month of the quarter 
further  in many cases  quarterly operating expense levels cannot be reduced rapidly in the event that quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations 
therefore  if quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations  the company s operating results would be adversely affected and there can be no assurance that the company would be able to operate profitably 
reductions of certain operating expenses  if incurred  in the face of lower than expected revenues could involve material one time charges associated with reductions in headcount  trimming product lines  eliminating facilities and offices  and of writing off certain assets 
the company has significant deferred tax assets in the accompanying balance sheets 
the deferred tax assets reflect the net tax effects of tax credit and operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
the company has expanded its product line to address the digital media production needs of the television broadcast news market and the emerging market for multimedia production tools  including the corporate and industrial user market 
the company has limited experience in serving these markets  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop such products successfully  or that such products will achieve widespread customer acceptance 
a significant portion of the company s future growth will depend on customer acceptance in these and other new markets 
any failure of such products to achieve market acceptance  additional costs and expenses incurred by the company to improve market acceptance of such products  or the withdrawal from the market of such products or of the company from such new markets could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s products operate primarily only on apple computers 
apple has recently been suffering business and financial difficulties 
in consideration of these difficulties  there can be no assurance that customers will not delay purchases of apple based products  or purchase compatible products based on non apple computers  that apple will continue to develop and manufacture products suitable for the company s existing and future markets or that the company will be able to secure an adequate supply of apple computers  the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company has from time to time developed new products  or upgraded existing products that incorporate advances in enabling technologies 
the company believes that further advances will occur in such enabling technologies  including microprocessors  computers  operating systems  bus architectures  storage devices  and digital media formats 
the company may be required  based on market demand  to upgrade existing products or develop other products that incorporate these further advances 
in particular  the company believes that it will be necessary to develop additional products which operate using the windows nt operating system 
there can be no assurance that customers will not defer purchases of existing apple based products in anticipation of the release of nt based products  that the company will be successful in developing nt based or other new products or that they will gain market acceptance  if developed 
any deferral by customers of purchases of existing apple based products  failure by the company to develop such products in a timely way or to gain market acceptance for them could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the markets for digital media editing and production systems are intensely competitive and subject to rapid change 
the company encounters competition in the film  video and audio production and post production  television broadcast news  and multimedia tools markets  including the corporate and industrial user market 
many current and potential competitors of the company have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
such competitors may use these resources to lower their product costs and thus be able to lower prices to levels at which the company could not operate profitably 
further  such competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those of the company or adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively in its target markets or that future competition will not adversely affect its business and results of operations 
the company is involved in various legal proceedings  including patent and securities litigation  an adverse resolution of any such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations
