item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant developments ccp holdings  inc acquisition on june   icrr used proceeds it received from the issuance of commercial paper average interest rate and average maturity days to pay a million dividend to the company and to loan million per annum to the company 
the company used the million and its bank credit lines to acquire ccp holdings  inc ccph 
the transaction closed june   following the effective date of the approval order issued by the surface transportation board stb 
the purchase price was million in cash  the assumption of approximately million in debt and approximately million of capitalized lease obligations existing on the acquisition date 
additionally  under the stock purchase agreement the actual purchase price is subject to various potential adjustments for up to one year after the closing date 
ccph has two principal operating subsidiaries the chicago central and pacific railroad ccpr and the cedar river railroad crr which together comprise a class ii railroad system operating miles of road 
ccpr operates from chicago to omaha  nebraska  with connecting lines to cedar rapids and sioux city  iowa 
crr runs from waterloo  iowa to albert lea  minnesota 
stock split on january   the board declared a for stock split in the form of a stock dividend to holders of record on february  new certificates were issued march  fractional shares were settled in cash at a rate of per share 
when certificates were issued  the approximate million shares outstanding increased to approximately million 
all share counts  options outstanding  option prices and per share information presented in this annual report have been restated to reflect the for split as if it had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented 
four year growth plan and plan in the company announced its first growth plan  for the years through since the key concepts million in revenue growth and an operating ratio of were reached by the end of  the company announced a second growth plan called plan plan calls for i revenue to grow from the base of million to million by the end of  ii the continued reduction of the operating ratio to below  and iii a long term equity enhancement program of increased dividends and share repurchases 
as designed  plan is intended to focus management on increasing operating performance and responding to general economic trends quickly 
the plan assumes that the company s growth  excluding coal use and worldwide grain demand  will be between and per year 
this assumption is based on internal analysis of published economic forecasts available when the plan was developed  such as the blue chip economic forecast  which predicted industrial production would gain to per year 
as for grain  plan assumes that export grain demand will be approximately  carloads annually 
to achieve plan  the company will concentrate on expanding the volume of business from current customers  seeking to locate new businesses or expansions by existing customers on our system  and raising rates when possible to reflect the value of the services the company provides 
to increase business in coal and grain  the company will work with shippers to develop strategies and service schedules to permit them to participate in the increasingly competitive world market 
for example  the company developed a concept of moving export grain to the gulf in unit trains of customer supplied cars  operating in dedicated  continuous service approximately ten months of the year 
as stated  a key goal of plan was revenue growth from million to million or approximately per year or in total 
after achieving revenues of in or an increase  icrr did not meet its revenue objectives in  in fact  icrr s revenues declined to million 
see results of operations and outlook for the cause of the shortfall and a discussion of because the acquisition of ccph was not contemplated when plan was developed  the company considers ccph s revenues will be additive to icrr s million revenue goal 
achieving plan is key to the company s incentive compensation programs because those programs are dependent on revenue growth and return on total capital rotc 
in icrr s revenue growth of exceeded the revenue goal of but in  as stated  revenues declined missing the goal 
for  the company s growth target is 
in  icrr had an rotc of  essentially meeting threshold performance and matching s performance 
for  the company s target rotc of recognizes that several capital projects like the terminals will use capital but not provide return until results of operations the discussion below takes into account the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the years presented in the consolidated financial statements and includes ccph since june  date of acquisition 
compared to total revenues for increased from the prior year by million or to million 
at icrr revenues declined million following a decrease in the number of carloadings coupled with a decrease in the average freight revenue per carload 
grain and grain mill accounted for of icrr s carloads and of ton miles in against  carloads  ton miles and revenues were down  and respectively 
grain was clearly the primary cause of the revenue shortfall 
the comparisons were particularly difficult against a record grain carloading year in illinois corn and soybean harvest was abnormally small so that by the third quarter grain elevators were essentially depleted and the new harvest was still weeks away 
rail rates were higher on average this year versus last  demand for grain was strong  the product just was not available to move 
the smaller crop also affected grain mill since domestic processors were forced to cut back on their usual production 
coal accounted for of icrr s carloads and of ton miles in against  carloads  ton miles and revenues were down  up and flat  respectively 
a large coal contract for  carloads was not renewed in july as a large customer wanted more aggressive pricing and went elsewhere 
thus  loads in late and the first half of compared with were significantly depressed 
however  for a second year in a row  coal margins  and the return on the assets involved  improved 
chemicals accounted for of icrr s carloads and of ton miles in compared with  ton miles were down while carloads and revenues were flat 
rail rates  under pressure in the earlier months of the year  firmed in the second half 
the softness observed in the economy  especially in the first two quarters was reflected in the building of chemical manufacturers inventories and softness in our customers pricing 
our customers markets firmed in the latter half of the year so that the company came in essentially flat in both chemical loads and revenues 
paper and forest products at icrr were of carloads and of ton miles 
total carloads were down while ton miles and revenues were down versus rail rates held up reasonably well throughout the year 
paper and forest products are economically sensitive commodities that respond to industrial production  housing starts and other basic economic indicators 
fiber and pulpboard were depressed all year 
bulk commodities contributed of carloads and ton miles in for icrr 
this represents carload and revenue growth of approximately while ton miles were down slightly from the level 
bulk commodities are primarily stone and other construction materials and are closely tied to state highway projects 
this smaller commodity group fluctuates with the timing of projects as well as the availability of freight cars for this lower margin business 
metals accounted for of icrr s carloads and of ton miles in for  versus  carloads  ton miles and revenues were up  and  respectively 
the steel industry had another strong year  and icrr set another record for metals loads and revenues 
finally  intermodal accounted for of icrr s loads and of ton miles 
versus  carloads were up  with ton miles and revenues up 
these results were achieved in an industry that saw trailer rate weakness earlier in the year and some weakness in automotive parts traffic later in the year 
at ccph  revenues of million were comprised of grain  coal  chemicals and all others 
operating expenses overall increased million or 
in of the total million  million was incurred at ccph for the period june  to december  labor and fringe costs include the wage increases of negotiated with nine of the icrr s unions and costs for ccph for the last half of the decline in this category is primarily the result of lower traffic levels  particularly grain  and the elimination of the high overtime caused by the congestion experienced in leases and car hire also benefited from the elimination of congestion to return to more normal operating levels 
in  favorable one time adjustments on several capital leases were recorded 
fuel expense reflects the increase in cost per gallon partially offset by decreased usage 
increased depreciation is a result of the acquisition of ccph 
the decrease in casualty  insurance and losses reflects the emphasis on safety and improved claims experience 
other expenses reflect the one time reversal of non revenue related accruals to actual million and favorable performance payments in joint facilities that congestion in prevented us from receiving 
million 
operating income for increased by million or to million for the reasons cited above 
on october   icrr sold its investments in an industry captive insurance company  rail  inc  which resulted in a one time gain  recorded as other income expense  net  of approximately million or 
per share 
net interest expense of million for increased compared to million in the expense includes million from increased borrowings to support the million transferred from icrr in june in connection with the acquisition of ccph 
overall in  average borrowings have been greater than and interest rates have been lower 
compared to revenues for increased from the prior year by million or to million 
the increase was a result of a increase in carloadings coupled with a increase in the average freight revenue per carload 
in  icrr experienced increased carloadings in intermodal  grain and grain mill products  paper and chemicals  partially offset by decreased loadings in coal 
operating expenses for increased million or 
labor and fuel expenses increased reflecting the increased loadings experienced in over depreciation expense was higher in because of the company s increased ownership of equipment 
other expenses  which include joint facilities  net and equipment related expenses  increased million 
partially offsetting the increased expenses was a million decrease in lease and carhire expense and decreased casualty  insurance and loss expense million reflecting the company s emphasis on safety and improved claims experience 
operating income for increased million or to million for the reasons cited above 
net interest expense of million for increased compared to million in increased debt burden primarily associated with equipment additions and stock repurchases account for the increase in interest expense 
results for  also reflect the issuance of lower coupon debt in connection with the prepayment of the icrr s million senior notes at face value  plus accrued interest and a prepayment penalty 
the prepayment resulted in an extraordinary loss of million  million after tax 
see liquidity and capital resources 
net income was further affected by a million after tax gain on the resolution of prior period tax issues 
outlook note this section is intended to provide an understanding of factors that will impact the company in and beyond 
this discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements of expectations  beliefs  plans  and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements 
these risks and uncertainties affecting the company are discussed in greater detail in a separate exhibit to the company s form k for illinois central corporation is now an operationally intergrated holding company of freight railroads and terminals which are coordinated by operating and marketing initiatives to originate  direct and control traffic over our service areas 
the company s principal subsidiary remains the icrr 
however  as a result of the ccph acquisition  the smaller chicago  central pacific and cedar river railroads are now subsidiaries 
as previously mentioned the revenues from these railroads are considered additive to plan the company has also formed a subsidiary  called ic railmarine terminal company  to construct and operate an import export  dry bulk handling terminal on the lower mississippi river 
and recently the company made an investment in a liquid bulk storage and distribution terminal that has been serving the petroleum and petrochemical industries for more than years 
both facilities are located just south of baton rouge  louisiana 
the dry bulk terminal will be operational in late or early the importance of this facility is highlighted in the commodity comments for metals below 
on a commodity basis grain following a disappointing  the good news is that corn and soybean harvests in both illinois and iowa were excellent 
the strong harvests did not immediately translate into improved traffic as farmers withheld product for better pricing 
also  export demand for us wheat has fallen in competition with other wheat exporting countries 
however  world grain stockpiles have been at historic lows and will take several consistently good growing seasons worldwide to fully replenish 
iowa and illinois together account for more than of all the corn produced in the us  icrr and ccph run through some of the richest and most productive farmland in the country 
we believe the fundamental grain outlook over the next several years is very positive for us  even as we recognize the vagaries of the weather and that export demand for us grains  from year to year  will always be more volatile than domestic demand  subject to the expansions and contractions of world supply as well as international agricultural and trade policies 
coal based on our current projections  dependent on stockpiles and weather in the service territories of the utilities we serve  the company expects to move approximately the same number of loads in as the subject of coal often evolves to the utility deregulation issue and its impact on the company 
since coal transportation represents a large cost factor for coal fired plants  some believe more intense competition among utilities  including power wheeling and coal by wire  may cause the pattern of coal movements to shift and rail rates to come under pressure 
while this may turn out to be an impact on the industry as a whole reflecting the effects on the dominant coal hauling railroads  applying the same logic to a niche player like icrr is probably overly simplistic 
the company doesn t have captive utilities 
we compete with low cost barge transportation on the mississippi and ohio rivers 
at this point  there are too many variables to know if utility deregulation will have a neutral  modestly positive or modestly negative effect on the company long term 
however  it is worth noting that today we enjoy better margins on coal than we did five years ago 
chemicals based on the improved economy experienced in late  growth of base chemical in should be consistent with the solid growth rates seen in the last few months of growth beyond will come through expansions of current facilities on our line for example  shell and fina and through the addition of new manufacturing capability 
in this latter category  shintech  a subsidiary of shin etsu chemical co  has announced construction of a major production complex on our line near geismar  louisiana  which is expected to begin operation in two years ago we built in the chicago area a facility to store plastic pellets in bulk and load them for customers into trucks for delivery to non rail served sites 
that facility has proven so successful  it will be expanded in to approximately double its size 
additionally  the liquid bulk terminal offers off site storage and handling capacity to our customers and eventually will allow them to expand their manufacturing capabilities 
paper and forest products following strong demand in and  producers increased production capacity in and early now the producers must struggle with the excess capacity in the industry 
therefore  we are not expecting a rapid turnaround in this commodity group  although longer term we believe we are well positioned for modest growth 
one of our largest customers has been re tooling a major mill to shift to long log input 
re tooling has not been completed as quickly as expected  however  the conversion will benefit us longer term 
as we will be able to carry the raw material into the mill in addition to hauling the finished product 
georgia pacific has completed a major distribution center on our line in northern illinois 
as this facility grows additional inbound and outbound carloads will add to paper volumes 
metals we expect metals volumes to approximate this year s very strong performance 
in late  birmingham steel will complete a mini mill in memphis 
this mill represents significant new manufacturing on our line and enhances the industrial park for potential future development 
metals will benefit from both this new mini mill in memphis and the ic railmarine terminal being constructed south of baton rouge 
railmarine s anchor customer is a joint venture between birmingham steel and gs industries 
the venture was formed to construct and operate a million direct reduced iron dri plant which will be adjacent to and served by our facility 
the joint venture will import iron ore through our terminal into their facility to produce dri 
the output will supply birmingham steel s and gs industries own mills 
much if not all of birmingham steel s share of the output will become input to their memphis mill 
intermodal this class of traffic is expected to continue its growth in although ccp is best known as a grain hauling railroad  we believe there is significant potential for intermodal growth  taking trucks off east west interstate and highway within days of the acquisition  we began dedicated intermodal service between chicago and ramps in council bluffs  sioux city  fort dodge  waterloo and dubuque 
the marketplace has already begun to respond to this new service with higher levels of traffic moving via rail 
in august  the burlington northern santa fe bnsf began interchanging with us at memphis in a traffic corridor that stretches from the west coast to the southeast 
the business originates and terminates in mobile and the arrangement creates a sufficient base of business to allow us to re open our previously underutilized mobile intermodal ramp 
in addition to serving the bnsf  re opening the mobile ramp allows us to market our own mobile to chicago service offering 
recently we began a new partnership with conrail which efficiently links the southern half of our system to their northeast markets 
other growth opportunities one of the company s strengths is its diverse customer base including chemical  grain  coal  forest products  metals and intermodal shippers 
in addition to our traditional customers  the company actively markets its services and facilities to other railroads so that today many of the major railroads are customers 
two of the most recent examples are the acre gateway intermodal terminal we built for the canadian national railway and a service and joint marketing agreement with bnsf the bnsf agreement to move traffic  originating primarily in texas  north over our line 
other issues consolidations the american railroad system has seen accelerated consolidation in the last few years and pending transactions suggest the trend will continue 
each rail merger presents a risk that rail traffic will be diverted around the company s railroads 
in the most extreme circumstances rail mergers could have a material adverse impact on revenues 
however  we believe that the company could adjust its operations to retain current levels of profitability 
management expects to continue to monitor developments and take actions to mitigate the impact of rail consolidations 
of course  no assurances can be given that such consolidations will not have a material adverse affect on the company 
the company also believes that consolidations are not necessarily problematic 
as is evident in the evolution of the company over the last several years  the company is inclined to see a changing landscape as a source of potential new opportunity for us 
and the company has done well in capitalizing on new opportunities that have developed out of the consolidation in the west as reflected by the bnsf agreement 
future investments the company continually considers a variety of investment opportunities including acquisition of rail and other properties 
the company is registered as an interested potential bidder in the privatization of the mexican railway system 
specifically  the company is interested in the southeast territory 
liquidity and capital resources operating data in millions cash flows provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash and temporary cash investments 
cash from operating activities in  and was primarily net income before depreciation  deferred taxes and extraordinary item and was also affected by the sales of accounts receivable 
investing data additions to property were as follows in millions communications and signals equipment rolling stock track and bridges other total for  track and bridges and other include million and million  respectively  for the cn terminal 
in  equipment includes million for new sd locomotives placed in service in the fourth quarter 
in  and capital expenditures exceeded original estimates as several opportunities to acquire equipment were acted upon in accordance with the company s strategy of owning more of its equipment 
property retirements and removals generated proceeds of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
base expenditures of million will concentrate on track maintenance  bridges and freight car upgrades 
another million will be spent on constructing the dry bulk transfer facility and expanding the recently acquired liquid bulk transfer facility located along the mississippi river in louisiana 
the company expects to fund of the dry bulk transfer facility cash requirements by the sale of a minority interest in the terminal 
most of the remainder of these expenditures are expected to be met from current operations or other available sources 
in june  following the effectiveness of the order by the stb  the company acquired the stock of ccph holdings  inc see note the company used its own bank credit lines and funds received from icrr a loan of million and a million dividend to complete the million transaction 
the acquisition is being treated as a purchase and under the stock purchase agreement  the actual purchase price is subject to potential adjustments for up to one year 
financing activities the company has a million day floating rate revolving loan agreement which expires in august in june  the company borrowed million under this agreement to acquire ccph see note  which was repaid in june 
at december   no amounts were drawn under this agreement 
ic financial leases equipment to icrr and has approximately million in long term borrowing agreements which were used to acquire locomotive and freight car equipment during and ic financial lease revenue and corresponding expense at icrr  which is eliminated in consolidation  was million for for the three years ended december   the company has paid million in cash dividends on its common stock 
dividends from icrr million in  million in and million in were used to fund these payments to stockholders  the acquisition of ccph and the million stock repurchase in see long term equity enhancement program 
included in the dividends to the company is the march transfer by icrr of its ownership in the chicago intermodal company cic via a dividend of cic stock 
the book value of the cic investment was million 
in june  ccph entered into a revolving credit agreement with its bank lending group for an unsecured million revolving credit facility  the ccph revolver 
the ccph revolver has a million sublimit for letters of credit and expires in the revolver can be used for general corporate purposes 
fees and borrowing spreads are predicated on the ratio of ccph s funded debt to ccph s earnings before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
currently  the annual commitment fee is basis points and borrowings are at the eurodollar offered rate plus basis points 
the credit agreement contains various financial covenants including minimum consolidated tangible net worth  minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratio 
ccph does not anticipate any difficulty in maintaining compliance with such covenants 
at december   million of ccph s revolver was outstanding 
ccph used million to repay amounts outstanding under a predecessor revolver which was then canceled 
icrr has a commercial paper program whereby a total of million can be issued and outstanding at any one time 
the program is supported by a million revolver with the railroad s lending group see below 
at december   standard poor s corporation s p  moody s investor services moody s and fitch investors service fitch have rated the commercial paper a  p and f  respectively  and million was outstanding 
the average interest rate on commercial paper for the year ended december   was with a range of to 
icrr views this program as a significant long term funding source and intends to issue replacement notes as each existing issue matures 
therefore  commercial paper borrowings are classified as long term 
icrr s public debt is rated baa by moody s and bbb by s p 
in  icrr entered into a revolving agreement to sell undivided percentage interests in certain of its accounts receivable  with recourse  to a financial institution 
the agreement  which expires in june  allows for sales of accounts receivable up to a maximum of million at any one time 
icrr services the accounts receivable sold under the agreement and retains the same exposure to credit loss as existed prior to the sale 
at december   million had been sold pursuant to the agreement 
costs related to the agreement fluctuate with changes in prevailing interest rates 
these costs  which are included in other income expense  net  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
icrr s accounting for the sale of accounts receivable is impacted by sfas no 
as a result  the agreement is expected to be modified to comply with this new standard so that the accounting and reporting for the sale of accounts receivables will remain unchanged 
in april  icrr concluded negotiations with its bank lending group whereby the railroad s million revolver was amended and restated 
the amendment reduced various facility fees and borrowing spreads  lowered the tangible net worth requirement beginning in the second quarter of and extended the expiration date to fees and borrowing spreads are predicated on icrr s long term credit ratings 
currently  the annual facility fee is basis points and borrowings under this agreement are at eurodollar offered rate plus basis points 
the revolver is used primarily for backup for icrr s commercial paper program but can be used for general corporate purposes 
the available amount is reduced by the outstanding amount of commercial paper borrowings and any letters of credit issued on behalf of icrr under the facility 
no amounts have been drawn under the revolver 
at december   the million was limited to million because million in commercial paper was outstanding 
certain covenants of icrr s debt agreements and ccph s revolver require among others specific levels of tangible net worth but not a specific dividend restriction 
at december   icrr and ccph exceeded their tangible net worth covenants by million and million  respectively 
both icrr and ccph were in compliance with all covenants at december   and do not contemplate any difficulty maintaining such compliance 
throughout and  icrr has been active in the public debt market  issuing bonds and medium term notes mtn s 
in december  icrr issued million aggregate amount of year debentures  due september  these bonds may not be redeemed until and then only at a premium which declines to par in in  million non callable year notes due may notes were issued 
see below 
a total of million in mtn s were issued over the two years as follows in millions principal year amount coupon issued matures the shelf registration from has been fully used 
a shelf registration from can be used to issue an additional million in mtn s or other debt until currently  there are no plans to issue additional debt but capital investments in the terminal facilities  other ventures and labor settlements could necessitate use 
in  icrr prepaid the holders of its million senior notes at face value plus accrued interest and a prepayment penalty 
the monies used to fund the prepayment were provided by commercial paper  the net proceeds of the notes and million from existing lines of credit 
the prepayment resulted in an extraordinary loss of million  million after tax 
per share 
the line of credit borrowings were replaced with the proceeds of mtn s 
the company believes that its available cash  cash generated by its operations and cash available from the facilities described above will be sufficient to meet foreseeable liquidity requirements 
additionally  the company believes it has access to the public debt market if needed 
miscellaneous icrr has entered into various diesel fuel collar agreements designed to mitigate significant changes in fuel prices 
as a result  approximately of icrr s short term diesel fuel requirements through june are protected against significant price changes 
the company has paid approximately million in and million in each of and for severance  lump sum signing awards and other costs associated with various labor agreements 
under the terms of local bargaining agreements  wages will rise per year 
in october  the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees membership ratified a new agreement which settles wage and work rules through in january  the united transportation union utu ratified a new agreement which settles wage and work rule issues through the utu agreement is similar to the nationally negotiated agreement in effect with other class i carriers 
the main distinction is timing of the various lump sum payouts and scheduled wage increases 
icrr continues to negotiate with its remaining operating union on a local level 
while no agreement is pending  an agreement may be reached that requires significant lump sum payment 
it is too early to determine if a separate agreement will be reached but management believes available funding sources will be sufficient to meet any required payment 
long term equity enhancement program the company paid its twentieth consecutive quarterly cash dividend on january  the board believes quarterly dividends are an integral part of its announced long term equity enhancement program designed to increase stockholder value through dividend payments and stock repurchases 
actual dividends are declared by the board of directors based on profitability  capital expenditure requirements  debt service and other factors 
during  the company completed a million stock repurchase program acquiring  shares in open market transactions 
while intended to be an annual component of the long term equity enhancement program  the board concluded that alternative funding needs  most notably the acquisition of ccp holdings  inc  the expansion of the intermodal facility in chicago and the construction of a bulk transfer facility in louisiana warranted the suspension of share repurchases under the program for further purchases are dependent on market conditions  the economy  cash needs and alternative investment opportunities 
the board intends to review stock repurchases annually 
environmental liabilities the company s operations are subject to comprehensive environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
compliance with such regulation requires the company to modify its operations and expend substantial manpower and financial resources 
under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of superfund  and similar state and federal laws  the company is potentially liable for the cost of clean up of various contaminated sites 
the company generally participates in the clean up at sites where other substantial parties share responsibility through cost sharing arrangements  but under superfund and other similar laws the company can be held jointly and severally liable for all environmental costs associated with such sites 
the company is aware of approximately contaminated sites at which it is probably liable for some portion of any required clean up 
of these  involve contamination primarily by diesel fuel which can be remediated without material cost 
five other sites are expected to require more than million in clean up costs 
at four of these sites other parties are expected to contribute the majority of the costs incurred 
the company paid approximately million toward the investigation and remediation at all sites in  and anticipates similar expenditures annually 
for all known sites of environmental contamination where company loss or liability is probable  the company has recorded an estimated liability at the time when a reasonable estimate of remediation cost and company liability can first be determined 
adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as necessary based upon additional information developed in subsequent periods 
estimates of the company s potential financial exposure for environmental claims or incidents are necessarily imprecise because of the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and extent of contamination  the varying costs of alternative methods of remediation  the regulatory clean up standards which will be applied  and the appropriate allocation of liability among multiple responsible parties 
at december   the company estimated the probable range of its liability to be million to million  and in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
had a reserve of million for environmental contingencies 
this amount is not reduced for potential insurance recoveries or third party contributions 
the risk of incurring environmental liability in connection with both past and current activities is inherent in railroad operations 
decades old railroad housekeeping practices were not always consistent with contemporary standards  historically the company leased substantial amounts of property to industrial tenants  and icrr continues to haul hazardous materials which are subject to occasional accidental release 
because the ultimate cost of known contaminated sites cannot be definitively established and because additional contaminated sites yet unknown may be discovered or future operations may result in accidental releases  no assurance can be given that the company will not incur material environmental liabilities in the future 
however  based on its assessments of the facts and circumstances now known  management believes that it has recorded adequate reserves for known liabilities and does not expect future environmental charges or expenditures  based on these known facts and circumstances  to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  cash flow or liquidity 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities sfas no 
 issued by the financial accounting standards board in and effective for  provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
the accounting for the icrr s sales of accounts receivable agreement is impacted by this standard 
as a result  the agreement is expected to be modified to comply with the sfas no 
requirements so that the accounting and reporting for the sale of the icrr s accounts receivable will remain unchanged 
in march  the financial accounting standards board released fasb statement no 
 earnings per share sfas no 

the new statement is effective december   early adoption is not permitted 
when adopted  sfas no
