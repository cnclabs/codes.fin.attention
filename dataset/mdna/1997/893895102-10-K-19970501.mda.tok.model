cash flow from operations is sensitive to the prices the company receives for its natural gas 
the company from time to time enters into commodity price swap agreements to reduce its exposure to price risk in the spot market for natural gas 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
a substantial portion of its production  however  will remain subject to price risk 
proceeds from natural gas sales are received at approximately the same time that production related burdens  such as royalties  production taxes and drilling program obligations are payable 
the company is engaged in exclusive negotiations to sell all of the stock of ttc  its subsidiary that owns substantially all the company s lobo trend producing properties and related pipeline transmission system  for an estimated sales price of approximately billion 
in addition  the company has engaged an investment banking firm to assist in the sale of its interest in the lodgepole prospect in north dakota 
the company intends to use the proceeds from these transactions for general corporate purposes which may include a recapitalization of transtexas 
there can be no assurance that the lobo sale will be consummated or  if consummated  will be upon the terms described herein 
the company makes substantial capital expenditures for the exploration  development and production of its natural gas reserves 
for the fiscal year ended january   the company s total capital expenditures were million  including million for lease acquisitions  million for drilling and development and million for the company s gas gathering and pipeline system and other equipment and seismic acquisitions 
the company anticipates that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will fund approximately million of capital expenditures during fiscal the company may supplement these capital resources with proceeds from asset sales and other financings in order to fund additional capital expenditures 
there is no assurance that additional funds can be obtained from these sources 
subject to availability of cash  however  the company plans total capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  of which approximately million would be used for drilling and development  million for the company s gas gathering and pipeline systems and other equipment and seismic acquisitions  and million for lease acquisitions 
if the lobo sale or a recapitalization is consummated  the capital expenditure budget will change 
if capital expenditures are higher than anticipated  cash flow from operations is lower than anticipated  additional asset sales or financings are not completed or certain contingent obligations of the company become fixed  the company may not have sufficient funds for capital expenditures necessary to replace its reserves or to maintain production at current levels and  as a result  production may decrease over time 
although cash from operating activities for the fiscal year ended january  has increased  primarily due to sales of volumetric production payments and a litigation settlement  net cash provided by operating activities declined over the three years ended january  in december  the company issued million in face amount of its series a senior subordinated notes due subordinated notes to unaffiliated third parties 
the subordinated notes were sold with original issue discount at a price equal to of the principal amount shown on the face thereof  for gross proceeds of approximately million

amounts available under and other terms of the bny facility may change if the lobo sale is consummated 
the company finances a portion of its working capital requirements and capital expenditures by entering into installment notes collateralized by certain equipment 
these notes bear interest at rates ranging from to per annum and mature at various dates through in january  the company entered into a reimbursement agreement with an unaffiliated third party pursuant to which the third party caused a million letter of credit to be issued to collateralize a supersedeas bond on behalf of the company 
if there is a draw under the letter of credit  the company is required to reimburse the third party within days 
in january  the company sold to an unaffiliated third party a term overriding royalty interest in the form of a volumetric production payment carved out of its interests in certain of its producing properties 
for net proceeds of approximately million  the company conveyed to the third party a term overriding royalty equivalent to a base volume of approximately bcf of natural gas  subject to certain increases in the base volume and in the percentage interest dedicated if certain minimum performance and delivery requirements are not met 
in february  in consideration for additional net proceeds of approximately million  the company supplemented the production payment to subject a percentage of its interests in certain additional producing properties to the production payment and to include additional volumes of approximately bcf of natural gas within the base volume subject to the production payment 
at january   approximately bcf of natural gas remained subject to this production payment 
in may  the company sold to two unaffiliated third parties a volumetric production payment for net proceeds of approximately million 
the company conveyed to the third parties a term overriding royalty equivalent to a base volume of approximately bcf of natural gas  subject to certain increases in the base volume and in the percentage interest dedicated if certain minimum performance and delivery requirements are not met 
concurrently with the closing of that transaction  the company and one of the unaffiliated third parties terminated  prior to the expiration of its stated term  a dollar denominated term overriding royalty interest previously sold by the company to that unaffiliated third party for a payment by the company of approximately million 
at january   approximately bcf of natural gas remained subject to the may production payment 
in september  the company sold to an unaffiliated third party a term royalty in the form of a dollar denominated production payment in certain of the company s properties for proceeds of million 
the production payment calls for the repayment of the primary sum plus an amount equivalent to a annual interest rate on the unpaid portion of such primary sum 
in september  the company entered into a drilling program agreement with an unaffiliated third party for the reimbursement of certain drilling costs with respect to wells drilled by the company 
pursuant to the agreement  upon the approval of the third party of a recently drilled or currently drilling well for inclusion in the program  the third party will commit to the reimbursement of all or a portion of the cost of such well  up to an aggregate maximum for all such wells of million 
the program wells are subject to a dollar denominated production payment equal to the primary sum of such reimbursed costs  plus an amount equivalent to a annual interest rate on the unpaid portion of such primary sum 
in april  all amounts due were paid in full 
in april  the company sold to an unaffiliated third party a term royalty in the form of a dollar denominated production payment in certain of the company s properties for proceeds of approximately million 
the production payment calls for the repayment of the primary sum plus an amount equivalent to a annual interest rate on the unpaid portion of such primary sum

on june  and august   the company consummated the sales  effective as of february   of certain other producing properties in webb county  texas for consideration of approximately million and million  respectively 
the purchase price for each of the properties discussed above was subject to adjustment for gas sales between the effective date and the closing date 
the company retained the proceeds of all such gas sales 
contingent liabilities the company has significant contingent liabilities  including liabilities with respect to litigation matters and other obligations assumed in the transfer 
these matters  individually and in the aggregate  amount to significant potential liability which  if adjudicated in a manner adverse to the company in one reporting period  could have a material adverse effect on the company s cash flow or operations for that period 
although the outcome of these lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty  the company does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position 
the company has delivered letters of credit and placed into escrow cash  which letters of credit and cash total approximately million  to be applied to certain potential litigation claims 
pursuant to the proposed terms of the lobo sale  transtexas would be required to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities related to the assets owned by ttc 
although transtexas does not anticipate that it will incur any material indemnity liability  no assurance can be given that transtexas will have sufficient funds to satisfy any such indemnity obligation or that any payment thereof will not have a material adverse effect on its ability to fund its debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
deconsolidation for federal income tax purposes under certain circumstances  transamerican  transamerican exploration corporation texc  tec or tarc may sell or otherwise dispose of shares of common stock of the company 
if  as a result of any sale or other disposition of the company s common stock or otherwise  the aggregate ownership of the company by transamerican and certain of its affiliates the tngc consolidated group excluding the company is less than measured by voting power and value  the company will no longer be a member of the tngc consolidated group for federal income tax purposes and  with certain exceptions  will no longer be obligated under the terms and conditions of  or entitled to the benefits of  a tax allocation agreement tax allocation agreement among members of the tngc consolidated group deconsolidation 
such sales may be necessary to raise funds required to complete tarc s expansion and modification program 
further  if tec or tarc sells or otherwise transfers any stock of tarc  or issues any options  warrants or other similar rights relating to such stock  outside of the tngc consolidated group  which when aggregated with warrants outstanding to purchase shares of common stock of tarc the tarc warrants represents more than of the voting power or equity value of tarc  then a deconsolidation of both tarc and the company from the tngc consolidated group would occur 
an event that results in deconsolidation of the company from the tngc consolidated group for tax purposes could result in the acceleration of payment of a substantial amount of federal income taxes by transamerican 
the tax liability to transamerican that would result from deconsolidation is estimated to be approximately million at january  each member of a consolidated group filing a consolidated federal income tax return is severally liable for the consolidated federal income tax liability of the consolidated group 
there can be no assurance that transamerican will have the ability to satisfy the above tax obligation at the time due and  therefore  the company  tarc or tec may be required to pay the tax 
under the tax allocation agreement  the company will be required to pay any texas franchise tax which is estimated not to exceed million which may be attributable to any gain recognized by transamerican on the transfer and will be entitled to any benefits of the additional basis resulting from the recognition of such gain 
potential effects of change of control capitalized words in the following discussion have the meanings as defined in the indenture 
the indenture provides that  upon the occurrence of a change of control  each holder of the notes will have the right to require the company to repurchase such holder s notes at of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest

stanley has  directly or indirectly  in the aggregate  sole beneficial ownership of more than  on a fully diluted basis  of the total voting power entitled to vote in the election of directors  managers  or trustees of the transferee  ii the liquidation or dissolution of the company  or iii any transaction  event or circumstance pursuant to which any person or group as such terms are used for purposes of sections d and d of the exchange act  whether or not applicable  other than john r 
stanley and his wholly owned subsidiaries or the trustee under the indenture  is or becomes the beneficial owner as that term is used in rules d and d under the exchange act  whether or not applicable  except that a person shall be deemed to be the beneficial owner of all shares that any such person has the right to acquire  whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time  directly or indirectly  of more than of the total voting power of the company s then outstanding voting stock  unless  at the time of the occurrence of an event specified in clauses i  ii or iii  the notes  issued under the indenture have an investment grade rating provided  however  that if  at any time within days after such occurrence  the notes cease having an investment grade rating  such event would constitute a change of control 
the term person  as used in the definition of change of control  means a natural person  company  government or political subdivision  agency or instrumentality of a government and also includes a group  which is defined as two or more persons acting as a partnership  limited partnership or other group 
the holders of the subordinated notes would also have a right to require the company to repurchase such securities upon the occurrence of a change of control 
in addition  certain changes or other events in respect of the ownership or control of the company that do not constitute a change of control under the indenture may result in a change of control of the company under the terms of the bny facility and certain equipment financing 
such an occurrence could create an obligation for the company to repay such other indebtedness 
at january   the company had approximately million of indebtedness excluding the notes and subordinated notes subject to such right of repayment or repurchase 
in the event of a change of control under the indenture or a change of control under the terms of other outstanding indebtedness  there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient funds to satisfy any such payment obligations 
tarc owns a large petroleum refinery in the gulf coast region along the mississippi river  approximately miles from new orleans  louisiana 
in february  tarc began a construction and expansion program designed to reactivate the refinery and increase its complexity capital improvement program 
tarc s debt securities are collateralized by  among other things  an aggregate of million shares of the company s common stock the common stock 
from february through march  tarc spent approximately million on the capital improvement program  procured a majority of the equipment required and completed substantially all of the process design engineering and a substantial portion of the remaining engineering necessary to complete this project 
primarily because additional funding was not available to tarc on a timely basis  tarc was unable to meet the construction completion timetable for the capital improvement program as required under the tarc notes indenture 
the holders of the tarc notes have waived  until july   the default under the tarc notes indenture which would have occurred on february  as a result of tarc s failure to meet the required completion timetable 
the waiver of this default will cease to be effective on july  unless the default has been further waived or tarc completes a recapitalization that satisfies the holders of the tarc notes  such holders would then be entitled to pursue remedies available under the tarc notes indenture  including acceleration of the maturity of the tarc notes 
any such event of default could result in the sale  following the occurrence of such event of default  of some or all of the remaining shares of common stock pledged to collateralize the tarc notes 
a foreclosure on such shares would constitute a change of control of the company under the bny facility and certain equipment financing  which may create an obligation for the company to repay amounts outstanding thereunder 
a sale of such shares following a foreclosure could also result in a change of control under the indenture 
see item tarc financial information 
inflation and changes in prices the company s results of operations and the value of its gas properties are highly dependent upon the prices the company receives for its natural gas 
substantially all of the company s sales of natural gas are made in the spot market  or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices  and pursuant to long term  fixed price contracts 
accordingly  the prices received by the company for its natural gas production are dependent upon numerous factors beyond the control of the company  including the level of consumer product demand  the north american supply of natural gas  government regulations and taxes  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the level of foreign imports of oil and natural gas and the overall economic environment 
demand for natural gas is seasonal  with demand typically higher during the summer and winter  and lower during spring and fall  with concomitant changes in price 
although certain of the company s costs and expenses are affected by the level of inflation  inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s results of operations during the year ended january  any significant decline in current prices for natural gas could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
based on current levels of production and certain hedge agreements  the company estimates that a per mmbtu change in average gas prices received would change annual operating income by approximately million 
forward looking statements forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act  are included throughout this report 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report on form k regarding the company s financial position  business strategy  and plans and objectives of management for future operations  including  but not limited to words such as anticipates  expects  estimates  believes and likely indicate forward looking statements 
the company s management believes its current views and expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  however  there are significant risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include fluctuations in the commodity prices for natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids  the extent of the company s success in discovering  developing and producing reserves  conditions in the equity and capital markets  the ultimate resolution of litigation  and competition 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond the control of transtexas 
the reserve data included and incorporated by reference in this offering circular represent only estimates prepared by netherland  sewell associates  inc netherland sewell 
gas reserve assessment is a subjective process of estimating the recovery from underground accumulations of gas that cannot be measured in an exact way  and estimates by other persons might differ materially from those of netherland sewell 
certain events  including production  acquisitions and future drilling and development could result in increases or decreases in estimated quantities of proved reserves 
in addition  estimates of transtexas future net revenues from proved reserves and the present value thereof are based on certain assumptions regarding future natural gas prices  production levels  production and ad valorem taxes and operating and development costs that may not prove to be correct over time

the company commenced partial operations at the refinery in march and temporarily ceased processing operations in december pending additional funding 
other factors in the decision to suspend processing operations included relatively low refining margins 
the relatively low margins were attributable to the high cost of feedstocks relative to intermediate product prices produced from the limited portion of the refinery being operated 
the company recommenced processing operations in may and temporarily ceased operations from october to april from time to time  the company will be required to suspend operations in order to tie in units as they are completed 
additionally  the company may suspend operations because of working capital constraints or operating margins 
the company does not consider its historical results to be indicative of future results 
the company s results of operations are dependent on the operating status of certain units within its refinery  which determines the types of feedstocks processed and refined product yields 
the results are also affected by the unit costs of purchased feedstocks and the unit prices of refined products  which can vary significantly 
the capital improvement program is designed to significantly change the company s throughput capacity  the feedstocks processed  and refined product yields 
six months ended january   compared with the six months ended january total revenues for the six months ended january  increased million to million from million in the same period in  primarily due to an increase in the volume of products sold to million barrels in from million barrels in in addition  million of the increase was due to an increase in the average product sales price of per barrel in over cost of products sold for the six months ended january  increased million to million from million for the same period in  primarily due to an increase in the volume of products sold  partially offset by a decrease in the average price of feedstocks purchased 
operations and maintenance expenses for the six months ended january  increased million to million from million for the same period in  primarily due to an increase in the number of days the vacuum unit was operating 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the six months ended january  increased million to million from million for the same period in  primarily due to the transfer of certain terminal facilities and tankage equipment from construction in progress to depreciable assets during the recent period 
general and administrative expenses for the six months ended january   decreased million to million from million for the same period in  primarily as a result of a reduction in litigation excerpted from the transition report on form k of tarc for the transition period from august  to january  as used herein  the term company refers to tarc  cross references are to the relevant sections of the tarc filing from which the information is excerpted  and other capitalized terms have the meanings attributed to such terms in the tarc filing from which the information is excerpted 
accruals  million  partially offset by an increase in payroll of million arising from operations support requirements 
taxes other than income taxes for the six months ended january  decreased million to million from million for the same period in  primarily due to the capitalization of refinery property taxes in the current period under the capital improvement program 
interest income for the six month period ended january   increased million compared to the same period in due primarily to interest earned on long term debt proceeds held in the collateral account 
interest expense for the six month period ended january   increased million due to interest accrued on long term debt issued in february  amortization of debt issue costs and financing costs associated with product purchases 
during the six months ended january   the company capitalized million of interest related to property and equipment associated with the capital improvement program 
year ended july   compared with the year ended july  total revenues for the year ended july   decreased million to million from million in the same period in  primarily due to a decrease in the volume of products sold which was partially offset by an increase in the average price of products sold 
cost of products sold for the year ended july   decreased million to million from million for the same period in  primarily as a result of a decrease in volume of products sold  partially offset by an increase in the average price of feedstocks purchased and a contract cancellation loss of approximately million 
operations and maintenance expense for the year ended july   increased million to million from million for the same period in  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of days the vacuum unit was operating 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended july   increased million to million from million for the same period in  primarily as a result of increased depreciation expense being recorded for refinery assets which were taken out of discontinued operations during general and administrative expenses for the year ended july   increased million to million from million in the same period in  primarily as a result of a litigation accrual of million and increases in legal and consulting fees and insurance costs as a result of expanded refinery operations 
taxes other than income taxes for the year ended july   increased million to million from million for the same period in  primarily as a result of an increase in property taxes assessed 
interest income for the year ended july   increased million compared to the same period in due primarily to interest earned on long term debt proceeds held in the collateral account

during the fourth quarter of  net loss before an extraordinary item increased million over the same period in  primarily due to interest associated with the company s long term debt and amortization of debt issue costs 
in february  transamerican contributed million shares of transtexas common stock to tec  and tec then contributed million of these shares of transtexas common stock to the company 
the equity in loss of transtexas for the year ended july   reflects the company s equity interest in transtexas loss before an extraordinary item from the date of acquisition 
the equity in extraordinary loss of transtexas represents the company s equity in a charge recorded by transtexas in the fourth quarter for the early retirement of million of its senior secured notes due from the proceeds of the issuance by transtexas in june of million in senior secured notes due year ended july   compared with the year ended july  total revenues for the year ended july   increased million to million from million in the same period in  primarily as a result of the company s operation of the vacuum unit at its refinery 
approximately of sales were to a single customer pursuant to a processing agreement 
cost of products sold for the year ended july   increased million as compared to the same period in  due to the operation of the vacuum unit at the refinery 
operations and maintenance expense for the year ended july   increased million to million from million for the same period in  primarily due to the operation of the vacuum unit at the refinery 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended july   increased million as compared to the same period in  due to the depreciation of refinery assets that were taken out of discontinued operations during general and administrative expenses for the year ended july   decreased million to million from million in the same period in  primarily as a result of a litigation accrual of million in liquidity and capital resources in connection with the issuance of the tarc notes  million of the proceeds thereof were deposited into a cash collateral account  designated for use in the capital improvement program 
the current budget for the capital improvement program calls for total expenditures of million  however  the company estimates that expenditures of approximately million to million in addition to the current budget will be required to complete the capital improvement program 
the foregoing estimates  as well as other estimates and projections herein  are subject to substantial revision upon the occurrence of future events  such as unavailability of  or delays in  financing  engineering problems  work stoppages and cost overruns over which the company may not have any control 
as of january   expenditures on the capital improvement program funded by or approved for reimbursement from the cash collateral account totaled approximately million 
approximately million remained in the cash collateral account as of january  the company sold million shares of transtexas common stock in march  and deposited approximately million of the proceeds of such sale into the cash collateral account in accordance with the requirements of the indenture 
giving effect to current estimates and the sale of transtexas stock in march  additional funding of million to million will be required to complete the capital improvement program 
as of january   the excerpted from the transition report on form k of tarc for the transition period from august  to january  as used herein  the term company refers to tarc  cross references are to the relevant sections of the tarc filing from which the information is excerpted  and other capitalized terms have the meanings attributed to such terms in the tarc filing from which the information is excerpted 
company had commitments for refinery construction and maintenance of approximately million 
additional funds necessary to complete the capital improvement program may be provided from i the sale of additional shares of transtexas common stock held by the company  ii the sale of common stock of the company  iii equity investments in the company including the sale of preferred stock of the company to tec  funded by the sale of transtexas common stock held by tec  iv capital contributions by transamerican  or v other sources of financing  the access to which could require the consent of the holders of the tarc notes 
there is no assurance that sufficient funds will be available from these sources or upon terms acceptable to the company and transamerican 
the company anticipates completing this financing on a timely basis  however  if this financing is not available or if significant engineering problems  work stoppages or cost overruns occur  the company likely will not be able to complete and test phase i of the capital improvement program by february  under the indenture  the failure of the company to complete and test phase i by february  subject to extension to august  if certain financial coverage ratios are met would constitute an event of default at such date 
the company and the south louisiana port commission port commission have reached an agreement in principle which would allow for the issuance of approximately million in port commission tax exempt bonds  the proceeds of which may be used to construct tank storage facilities  docks and air and waste water treatment facilities for the company s fcc unit 
the air and waste water treatment facility are included in the capital improvement program  however  the issuance of the tax exempt bonds could provide an alternate source of financing for the construction of such facilities 
the port commission would own the facilities built with the proceeds of the bonds  and the company would operate the facilities pursuant to a long term year lease 
there can be no assurance that the issuance of the taxexempt bonds  which may require the consent of the holders of the tarc notes  will occur 
the company has incurred losses and negative cash flow from operations as a result of limited refining operations which did not cover the fixed costs of maintaining the refinery  increased working capital requirements and losses on refined product sales due to product financing costs and low margins 
based on recent refining margins  projected levels of operations and debt service requirements  such negative cash flows are likely to continue 
in order to operate the refinery and service its debt  the company must raise debt or equity capital in addition to the funds required to complete the capital improvement program 
transamerican  tec or the company may sell securities to raise funds for additional working capital 
there is no assurance that additional capital will be available 
without additional funding to complete phase i of the capital improvement program and to provide working capital for operations and debt service  there is substantial doubt about the company s continued existence 
if the company i does not complete the capital improvement program timely  ii incurs significant cost overruns  iii does not ultimately achieve profitable operations  or iv ceases to continue operations  the company s investment in the refinery may not be recovered 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments for such uncertainties 
a change of control or other event that results in deconsolidation of the company from transamerican s consolidated group for federal income tax purposes could result in the acceleration of payment of a substantial amount of federal income taxes by transamerican 
each member of a consolidated group filing a consolidated federal income tax return is severally liable for the consolidated federal income tax liability of the consolidated group 
there can be no assurance that transamerican will have the ability to satisfy the above tax obligation at the time due and  therefore  the company  or other members may be required to pay the tax 
a decision by tec or the company to sell transtexas shares could result in deconsolidation of transtexas for tax purposes 
the tax liability to transamerican at january  which would result from deconsolidation is estimated to be approximately million

the company enters into financing arrangements in order to maintain an available supply of feedstocks 
typically  the company enters into an agreement with a third party to acquire a cargo of feedstock which is scheduled to be delivered to the company s refinery 
the company pays through the third party all transportation costs  related taxes and duties and letter of credit fees for the cargo  plus a negotiated commission 
prior to arrival at the refinery  another third party purchases the cargo  and the company commits to purchase  at a later date  the cargo at an agreed price plus commission and costs 
the company also places margin deposits with the third party to permit the third party to hedge its price risk 
the company purchases these cargos in quantities sufficient to maintain expected operations and is obligated to purchase all of the cargos delivered pursuant to these arrangements 
in the event the refinery is not operating  these cargos may be sold on the spot market 
during the six months ended january   approximately million barrels of feedstocks with a cost of million were sold by a third party on the spot market prior to delivery to the company without a material gain or loss to the company 
in march  the company entered into a processing agreement with a third party for the processing of various feedstocks at the refinery 
the company is required to pay all costs for feedstock acquisition  transportation  processing and inspections plus a commission for each barrel processed 
the company is entitled to a processing fee based on the margin after all costs  if any  earned by the third party on the sale of refined products 
this agreement provides for the company to process approximately million barrels of feedstock 
in april  the company entered into a similar processing agreement with another third party 
environmental compliance and permitting issues are an integral part of the capital expenditures in the capital improvement program 
during the next three fiscal years the company does not expect to incur significant expenses for environmental compliance in addition to the amounts included in the capital improvement program 
there is no assurance  however  that costs incurred to comply with environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
the company also has contingent liabilities with respect to litigation matters as more fully described in note of notes to financial statements 
on december   litigation with frito lay  inc was settled 
the company intends to pay million to frito lay  inc during fiscal year in accordance with the tax allocation agreement and other relevant documents 
inflation and changes in prices the company s revenues and feedstock costs have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the prices of petroleum and petroleum products 
the company s ability to obtain additional capital is also substantially dependent on refined product prices and refining margins  which are subject to significant seasonal  cyclical and other fluctuations that are beyond the company s control 
from time to time  the company enters into futures contracts  options on futures  swap agreements and forward sale agreements for crude and refined products intended to protect against a portion of the price risk associated with price declines from holding inventory of feedstocks and refined products  or for fixed price purchase commitments 
the company s policy is not to enter into fixed price or other purchase commitments in excess of anticipated processing requirements 
the company believes that these current and anticipated futures transactions do not and will not constitute speculative trading as specified under and prohibited by the indenture

the company commenced partial operations at the refinery in march and has operated the vacuum unit intermittently since then 
the company s decision to commence or suspend operations is based on the availability of financing  current operating margins and the need to tie in units as they are completed 
the company does not consider its historical results to be indicative of future results 
the company s results of operations are dependent on the operating status of its refinery equipment  which determines the types of feedstocks processed and refined product yields 
the results are also affected by the unit costs of purchased feedstocks and the unit prices of refined products  which can vary significantly 
the capital improvement program is designed to significantly change the company s throughput capacity  the feedstocks processed  and refined product yields 
as more fully described in liquidity and capital resources  management does not believe that the company will be able to complete phase i of the capital improvement program by february  under the indenture  the failure of the company to complete and test phase i by february  would constitute an event of default at such date

losses from processing arrangements  which are discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  of million for the three months ended october  were primarily due to low margins and price management activities 
operations and maintenance expense for the three months ended october  decreased to million from million for the same period in  primarily due to decreases in salaries and refinery fuel costs 
taxes other than income taxes for the three months ended october  decreased to million from million for the same period in  primarily due to decreased franchise tax expense 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the three months ended october  from million for the same period in  primarily due to decreased litigation expense 
interest income for the three months ended october  decreased million as compared to the same period in primarily due to interest earned in on a higher balance held in the collateral account

due to a larger portion of interest capitalized in versus during the three months ended october   the company capitalized approximately million of interest related to property and equipment additions at the company s refinery compared to million for the three months ended october  the equity in loss of transtexas for the three months ended october  of million reflects the company s equity interest in transtexas 
nine months ended october   compared with the nine months ended october  total revenues for the nine months ended october  decreased to million from million for the same period in  due to processing of feedstocks for third parties in the prior period 
costs of products sold for the nine months ended october  decreased to million from million for the same period in  due to processing feedstocks for third parties in the prior period 
losses from processing arrangements  which are discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  for the nine months ended october  of million were primarily due to low margins and price management activities 
operations and maintenance expense for the nine months ended october  increased to million from million for the same period in  primarily due to an increase in fuel costs during the first six months of fiscal year and contract labor costs 
taxes other than income taxes for the nine months ended october  increased to million from million for the same period in  primarily due to increased property tax expense 
general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended october  decreased to million from million for the same period in  primarily due to decreased litigation expense

liquidity and capital resources the current budget for the capital improvement program calls for total expenditures of million 
as of october   expenditures on the capital improvement program funded by or approved for reimbursement from the cash collateral account totaled approximately million 
the company will require substantial additional financing in excess of the current budget over the course of the remaining construction period to complete the capital improvement program

financing 
the company is currently negotiating with potential third party investors to provide for additional funding  including strategic equity investors  financial investors and foreign producers of crude oil 
primarily because additional funding was not available to the company on a timely basis  management believes that the company will not be able to complete phase i of the capital improvement program by february  under the indenture  the failure of the company to complete and test phase i by february  would constitute an event of default at such date 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  either the indenture trustee or the holders of in aggregate principal amount of the tarc notes then outstanding may declare all principal of the tarc notes and accrued interest thereon to be due and payable immediately 
prior to the declaration of acceleration of the maturity of the tarc notes  the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the tarc notes at the time outstanding may waive on behalf of all the holders any default  except a default in the payment of principal  of premium  if any  or interest on any tarc note not yet cured  or a default with respect to any covenant or provision that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding tarc note affected 
the company anticipates that  prior to february   it will solicit the holders approval with respect to any elements of a proposed financing that otherwise would be limited by the terms of the indenture  as well as to a revised budget and an extension of the required completion date for phase i 
there can be no assurance that current negotiations will result in additional financing for the capital improvement program  that other financing will be available  or that the requisite approval of the holders can be obtained 
as of october  the company had expended the million placed in the collateral account from the issuance of the tarc notes in february as well as the proceeds from the march sale of transtexas common stock 
in may  in anticipation of the limited availability of collateral account funds  the company began scaling back expenditures on the capital improvement program so that remaining funds were expended only on those critical path items necessary to complete and test refinery units by the dates specified in the indenture 
in july  the company executed a promissory note to transamerican for up to million 
the note bears interest at a rate of per annum  payable quarterly beginning october   and matures on july  as of october   the entire million was outstanding under the note 
on november   the company executed an additional million promissory note to transamerican which bears interest at per annum  payable quarterly beginning december   and which matures on september  at november   the company had approximately million outstanding under these notes 
the company has not made the scheduled interest payment provided for in the first note 
these and additional borrowings are being utilized by the company to fund the critical path items mentioned above  as well as working capital needs  pending additional financing from other sources 
there can be no assurance that transamerican will make additional advances to the company 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
as of february   the company adopted the requirements of sfas no 
the company currently believes  based on estimates of refining margins and current estimates for costs of the capital improvement program that future undiscounted cash flows will be sufficient to recover the cost of the refinery over its estimated useful life as well as the costs of related identifiable intangible assets 
management believes there have been no events or changes in circumstances that would require the recognition of an impairment loss 
however  due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating future refining margins  in constructing and operating a large scale refinery and the uncertainty regarding the company s ability to complete the capital improvement program there can be no assurance that the company will ultimately excerpted from the quarterly report on form q of tarc for the quarter ended october  the following is not a complete financial statement presentation

recover the cost of the refinery 
see note to the condensed financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the company has incurred losses and negative cash flow from operations as a result of limited refining operations that did not cover the fixed costs of maintaining the refinery  increased working capital requirements and losses on refined product sales and processing arrangements 
such losses are due to financing costs  low margins and price management activities 
based on recent refining margins  recent projected levels of operations and debt service requirements  such negative cash flows from operations are likely to continue 
primarily as a result of these factors and accounts payable related to the capital improvement program  the company had negative working capital of million at october  in order to operate the refinery and service its debt  the company must raise debt or equity capital in addition to the funds required to complete the capital improvement program 
there is no assurance that additional financing for the capital improvement program  additional working capital  or any necessary approval from the holders will be obtained or that profitable operations will be ultimately achieved 
as a result  there is substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
if the company i does not complete the capital improvement program timely  ii incurs significant cost overruns  iii does not ultimately achieve profitable operations  or iv ceases to continue operations  the company s investment in the refinery may not be recovered 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments for the above uncertainties 
a change of control or other event that results in deconsolidation of the company from transamerican s consolidated group for federal income tax purposes could result in the acceleration of payment of a substantial amount of federal income taxes by transamerican 
each member of a consolidated group filing a consolidated federal income tax return is severally liable for the consolidated federal income tax liability of the consolidated group 
there can be no assurance that transamerican will have the ability to satisfy the above tax obligation at the time due and  therefore  the company or other members may be required to pay the tax 
a decision by tec or the company to sell transtexas shares could result in deconsolidation of transtexas for tax purposes 
such sales may be necessary to raise funds required to complete the capital improvement program 
transamerican s tax liability that could result from deconsolidation is estimated to be approximately million at october  the company as a member of the consolidated group is severally liable for this liability 
to the extent transamerican is unable to fund the entire liability  the company may be required to pay a portion of this tax 
the company is unable to determine its share  if any  of the liability which would result from deconsolidation because i it is uncertain whether deconsolidation will occur and ii if deconsolidation should occur  it is uncertain whether the company would be required to fund any portion of the tax liability under the joint and several liability provisions 
the company enters into financing arrangements to maintain an available supply of feedstocks 
typically  the company enters into an agreement with a third party to acquire a cargo of feedstock scheduled for delivery to the company s refinery 
the company pays through the third party all transportation costs  related taxes and duties and letter of credit fees for the cargo  plus a negotiated commission 
prior to arrival at the refinery  another third party purchases the cargo  and the company commits to purchase  at a later date  the cargo at an agreed price plus commission and costs 
the company also places margin deposits with the third party to permit the third party to hedge its price risk 
the company purchases these cargos in quantities sufficient to maintain expected operations and is obligated to purchase all of the cargos delivered pursuant to these arrangements 
in the event the refinery is not operating  these cargos may be sold on the spot market 
during the nine months ended october   approximately million barrels of feedstocks with a cost of million were sold by a third party on the spot market prior to delivery to the company without a material gain or loss to the company

as used herein  the term company refers to tarc  cross references are to the relevant sections of the tarc filing from which the information is excerpted  and other capitalized terms have the meanings attributed to such terms in the tarc filing form which the information is excerpted 
in march  the company entered into a processing agreement with a third party for the processing of various feedstocks at the refinery
