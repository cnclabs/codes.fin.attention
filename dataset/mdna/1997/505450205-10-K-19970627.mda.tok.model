item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the private securities litigation reform act of contains certain safe harbors regarding forward looking statements 
in this context  the discussion in this item contains forward looking statements which involve a certain degree of risk and uncertainty  including statements relating to liquidity and capital resources 
factors that could cause or contribute to the actualization of such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the market acceptance of and the demand for the company s products  the development of technology and manufacturing capabilities  the expanded presence in the consumer market  the impact of competitive products on the company s profitability and the company s dependence upon third party suppliers 
overview the company was incorporated in april to develop and market advanced d interactive motion control hardware and software products for the industrial cad cam cae workstation market 
historically  the company has generated revenues from sales of bundled hardware and software  and such sales are dependent upon prior incorporation of the company s enabling software into d applications developed by isvs 
product revenues generated by the incorporation of the company s software into a specific isv application may lag six to eighteen months after the incorporation activity is completed 
the company also generates revenues from maintenance services  although historically these revenues have been immaterial 
in fiscal  the company launched its first hardware and software products aimed at the industrial pc marketplace 
early in fiscal  the company began marketing its first stand alone software product for the pc cad marketplace  and commenced limited test marketing of its first consumer product  targeted at pc games 
in late fiscal  the company began marketing the ergonomically improved  cost reduced version of the consumer product to the oem marketplace as the initial step in its goal of achieving long term growth in the consumer sector 
the company commenced shipments of its new game controller into the consumer market in the third quarter of fiscal for reasons of manufacturing and volume efficiencies  the company contracts all of its hardware manufacturing to outside sources 
primary manufacturing of its products had previously been through multiple domestic contract manufacturers  with final functional testing and quality control performed by the company 
late in fiscal  the company began directing its manufacturing to offshore contract manufacturers to reduce the cost of goods through high volume manufacturing 
research and development comprises both hardware and software activities 
hardware development has focused on creating products utilizing the company s core hardware technology  but designed for specific end use markets  and engineering these components to reduce manufacturing costs 
this has resulted in products for the workstation  pc and consumer markets  and significant cost reductions in the core technology 
in fiscal  the company began sampling its new low cost eclipse asic chip for use in its own proprietary controllers 
the eclipse asic chip is incorporated into the spaceorb  which began shipping to customers during fiscal the primary activity in software development has been to create specialized d motion control software and software tools to enable the company s products to be integrated into specific application software 
software development activities have increased as the number of d applications into which the company s software has been integrated has increased  and upon entering the professional pc multimedia animation market and consumer multimedia edutainment market with d interactive software programs 
results of operations comparison of fiscal year ended march  to the fiscal year ended march revenues 
revenues increased to  for the fiscal year ended march  fiscal year from  for the fiscal year ended march  fiscal year 
the increase in revenues is attributable to the company s launch of the spaceorb reallife d spaceorb game controller into the consumer market 
this was the first year that the company sold a consumer product 
although the spaceorb enjoys widespread acceptance in the early adopter  hard core gamer market  sales to the mass market have lagged due to delays in customer acceptance of the product 
the company was unable to clearly differentiate its product from other lower priced computer control devices 
as a result  management has implemented a strategy of forming strategic partnerships to more effectively penetrate the consumer market sales to the industrial market for the fiscal year were negatively impacted by slower than expected sales to both domestic and international cad and multimedia customers 
the spaceball  a new lower priced input device for workstation based d cad applications  negatively impacted sales of the higher priced spaceball 
the company s expectations that the lower cost would encourage bundling by oem customers and increase unit sales sufficiently to offset any negative price impact were not met 
revenues from software and other licensing agreements for the fiscal year represent sales of panacea software products  as well as licensing of core hardware and software technology 
a significant portion of the licensing revenues for the year include one time licensing payments 
two customers represented and of the company s revenues for the fiscal year as compared with two customers representing and of sales for the fiscal year 
export sales  all of which are denominated in us dollars  decreased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year 
in the industrial sector  export sales are expected to increase at a faster rate than the domestic market 
gross profit 
gross profit  representing revenues less cost of revenues including costs of materials  costs of manufacturing overhead  royalties and amortization of capitalized software  decreased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year and represented and of revenues  respectively 
gross profit declined mainly due to write offs of capitalized software and a write down of inventory to net realizable value 
the company completed an evaluation of the projected revenue stream associated with inventory components related to the spaceorb and capitalized software  which indicated that the recoverability of the costs of these assets was uncertain 
therefore  the company recognized a  charge for the write down of its capitalized software and a  charge for the write down of its inventory 
the gross profit was further impacted by the introduction of the spaceorb  which has significantly lower gross margins than the industrial market products 
as the company shifts its sales mix from direct to oem channels for industrial products  and increases the percentage of sales derived from consumer products  it is expected that the gross profit percentage will continue to be below traditional levels 
the decline is expected to be partially offset by lower costs of manufacturing under volume production 
the company s expectations regarding the decline in gross profit percentage and decreases in production costs are forward looking statements 
there can be no assurance that such decreases in profit will not be greater than anticipated or that cost savings will not be less than anticipated due to numerous factors  including unanticipated development issues arising with respect to this new technology as the company initiates volume production 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses  which include personnel costs  advertising and marketing costs  sales commissions and trade show expenses  increased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year and represented and of revenues  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the initial marketing program for the spaceorb  including extensive non recurring television advertising and promotion expenses in excess of  additional personnel and recruiting costs associated with an expansion of the sales and marketing infrastructure were also incurred during the year 
management anticipates selling and marketing expenses to decline as a percentage of revenues in the fiscal year ending march  fiscal year  due to cost containment programs implemented during the fiscal year 
the statement concerning the company s expectations regarding the level of sales and marketing expenses is a forward looking statement 
such expenses may vary from expectations due to timing of marketing programs and other factors 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  which include the costs of the company s corporate finance  human resources and administrative functions  increased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year  and represented and of sales respectively 
the increase is associated with increased personnel costs to expand the administrative infrastructure as well as increases in professional fees and filing fees due to additional reporting requirements consequent upon becoming a public company 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  which consist primarily of personnel and equipment costs required to conduct the company s software and hardware development and engineering efforts  increased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year and represented and of revenues  respectively 
the increase reflects significant investments in personnel and consultants necessary to expand software product development efforts  particularly in the consumer  multimedia and pc cad markets  and engineering efforts designed to lower the cost of manufacturing of the company s hardware components 
capitalized software costs amounted to  for the fiscal year in comparison to  for the fiscal year 
the company plans to continue expansion of software products for the consumer and the industrial marketplaces  as well as to commence development of specialized d interactive motion control stand alone software for licensing and revenue generation that is independent of the company s hardware products 
as such  management expects that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the fiscal year 
provision for income taxes 
the current federal tax benefit represents taxes receivable arising primarily from the carryback of the fiscal loss to the three previous years and other refunds

the company had two customers representing and of the company s revenues for the fiscal year as compared to two customers representing and of sales for the fiscal year 
export sales increased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year 
increased revenues reflect  among other factors  the overall growth in the market for d software  greater market availability due to the release of new applications in which the company s software is incorporated  and wider acceptance of the company s products by end users 
gross profit 
gross profit  representing revenues less cost of revenues including costs of materials  costs of manufacturing overhead  royalties and amortization of capitalized software  increased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year and represented and of revenues  respectively 
the increase in gross profit was primarily due to increases in revenues  as well as reductions in the cost of materials and savings resulting from efficiencies in manufacturing operations 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to amortization of capitalized software expense amounting to  for the fiscal year versus  for the fiscal year 
selling and marketing expenses

during the year the company added major new distribution agreements with digital equipment corporation and sun express  and continued to increase the number of vars  especially for the pc cad and multimedia marketplace 
the increase in expenses reflect  among other factors  the expansion of activities in existing markets  investments in market development and sales and marketing infrastructure necessary to penetrate new markets  especially the pc cad  multimedia and consumer markets 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  which include the costs of the company s corporate  finance  human resources and administrative functions  decreased to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year  and represented and of sales respectively

capitalized software costs amounted to  for the fiscal year in comparison to  for the fiscal year 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was for the fiscal year versus for the fiscal year 
the tax rate was below the statutory rate in both years due to tax benefits resulting from research and development credits  which were eliminated at the federal level at the end of june the company utilized all carryforwards related to the research and development credit in quarterly operating results the following tables set forth certain consolidated quarterly financial information of the company  for the fiscal year and fiscal year 
this information has been derived from the quarterly financial statements of the company which are unaudited but which  in the opinion of management  have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that management considers necessary for a fair presentation 
this information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
three month period ended june sept dec mar june sept dec mar in thousands except per share data revenues         gross profit        income loss from operations   net income loss   net income loss per common share the company expects that it will continue to experience fluctuations in its quarterly operating revenues and gross profit 
this variability has been caused by factors such as the timing of new product introductions and upgrades  the timing of significant orders  the mix of products sold  and the mix of oem and direct sales to end users 
liquidity and capital resources to date  the company has funded its operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash generated from operations and the proceeds of equity financing arrangements 
as of march  the company had cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities of  and working capital of  versus  and  respectively at march  the company has no outstanding line of credit or other indebtedness for borrowed money 
the company used  to fund operating activities in the current year versus  provided by operations in the prior year 
the use of funds is primarily attributable to the net loss of  the increase in inventory of  and the increase in income taxes receivable  totaling  inventory levels were high as a result of significant purchases made in order to have the necessary anticipated quantities of the new spaceorb ready for shipment for the holiday season 
the increase in income taxes receivable reflects applications made to the internal revenue service for refunds resulting from the carryback of the fiscal year net operating loss to the three previous years 
net cash provided to the company through investing activities totaled  during the fiscal year 
the increase is attributable to net proceeds in the amount of  generated from sales of the company s available for sale securities 
the increase was offset by  for purchases of furniture and equipment  primarily computer equipment and additional investments in tools and dies for high volume  low cost manufacturing of the company s hardware components   expenditures for intangible assets primarily patents and software development costs totaling  the company anticipates that capital expenditures for the fiscal year will exceed capital expenditures for the fiscal year  but it has no commitments or specific plans for any significant purchases 
the company expects that purchases of computers and related equipment will be required upon the hiring of additional research and development staff 
financing activities used  of net cash in the current year primarily as a result of the company repurchasing common stock 
the cost was offset by the proceeds received on the exercise of employee stock options the company believes existing cash and investment securities together with future anticipated funds from operations  will satisfy its projected working capital and other cash requirements through the end of its fiscal year ending march  substantial funds will be required to continue software and hardware development  as well as to develop the sales and marketing infrastructure  distribution channels and market awareness in the pc multimedia and consumer marketplaces 
the company believes the level of financial resources available to it is an important competitive factor in its industry and may seek additional capital prior to the end of that period 
in addition  the company may consider potential acquisitions of technologies and businesses complementary to the company s business 
there are no present agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition  however  any such transaction may affect the company s future capital needs 
the company s capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate at which the company can develop its products  the market acceptance of such products  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch such products and attain a competitive position in the marketplace  the response of competitors to the products based on the company s technology  and capital necessary for potential acquisitions 
changes in technology or a growth of sales beyond currently established capabilities will also require further investment 
to the extent that the company s current financial resources are insufficient to fund the company s operating requirements  it may be necessary for the company to seek additional funding through public or private financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  further dilution to the existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  the company s business would be materially adversely affected  and  as a result  the company may be required to curtail its operations significantly
