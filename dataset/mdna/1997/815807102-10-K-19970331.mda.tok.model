certain factors affecting future operating results statements made or incorporated in this form k include a number of forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements include  without limitation  statements containing the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  future  and words of similar import which express management s belief  expectations or intentions regarding the company s future performance 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
certain factors that might cause such a difference are discussed below 
short operating history  accumulated deficit the company was founded in to provide software porting services to independent software vendors 
in  the company reorganized its business to focus on the development and marketing of automated testing software for the quality assurance market 
the company shipped its first automated testing product  qa partner  in the quarter ended march  accordingly  the company has a limited operating history and  although the company has experienced growth in recent periods  continued growth at the same rate is not sustainable and is not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
losses have resulted in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  the company had net income of  in  a loss of  in and net income of  in the limited operating history of the company makes the prediction of future results difficult and  therefore  there can be no assurance that the company will sustain revenue growth or achieve profitability on a consistent basis 
potential fluctuations in operating results the company may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results  which may be caused by many factors  including the timing of introductions of new products or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  personnel changes  the size and timing of individual orders  software bugs or other product quality problems  competition and pricing  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products or product enhancements  reduction in demand for automated software testing products  changes in operating expenses  product mix  and general economic conditions 
a substantial portion of the company s operating expenses are related to personnel  facilities and marketing programs 
the level of spending for such expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is based  in significant part  on the company s expectations of future revenues 
if actual revenue levels are below management s expectations  results of operations are likely to be adversely affected 
in addition  the company does not typically experience order backlog 
furthermore  the company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of a quarter  with these revenues frequently concentrated in the last weeks or days of a quarter 
as a result  product revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in the latter part of that quarter  and revenues for any future quarter are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
for these reasons  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
moreover  although the company has not historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in its revenue or results of operations  such fluctuations are not uncommon in the software industry and may affect the company in the future 
dependence on principal product to date  the company has derived substantially all of its revenues from licenses of qa partner and related products and from fees for related services 
as a result  any factors adversely affecting the sales of qa partner  such as increased price competition or the introduction of technologically superior products  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s future financial performance will depend in significant part on its ability to develop and introduce new releases of qa partner with enhanced features and functionalities and related products 
there can be no assurance that any such new releases or products will be successfully developed or achieve market acceptance 
emerging market the market for automatic software testing products is relatively new and undeveloped 
marketing and sales techniques in the automated software testing marketplace  as well as the bases for competition  are not well established 
there can be no assurance as to the extent that a significant market for automated software testing products will develop or the extent to which the company s products will be accepted in that market 
although the company believes that the current trend toward increased use of automated software testing will continue  a majority of software testing is still carried out manually  and there can be no assurance that the automated software testing market will enjoy continued growth 
the commercial market for products and services designed for use with the internet and the internet s world wide web has only recently begun to develop  and the success of the company s products may depend  in part  on their compatibility with the internet and the internet s world wide web 
it is difficult to predict with any assurance whether the internet will prove to be a viable commercial marketplace or whether the demand for internet related products and services will increase or decrease in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively adapt its products to the internet or to successfully compete in the market for internet related products and services 
management of growth the company has recently experienced a period of rapid growth  including a substantial increase in the number of orders  customers and employees 
such growth has placed  and may continue to place  strains on the company s management  operations and systems 
the company s ability to compete effectively will depend  in part  upon its ability to expand  improve and effectively utilize its operational  management  marketing  sales and financial systems as necessitated by changes in the company s business 
any failure by the company s management to effectively anticipate  implement and manage the changes required to sustain the company s growth could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage such change 
rapidly changing technology  new products  risk of product defects the market for computer software products is generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions that can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
the company believes that a major factor in its future success will be its ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner enhancements to its existing products and new products that will gain market acceptance 
if the company is unable to introduce new products and respond to industry changes on a timely basis  its business could be materially adversely affected 
software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
although the company has not experienced material adverse effects resulting from undetected errors in the past  there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  because the company is in the quality assurance business  any errors in its software could harm the company s reputation in the quality assurance software market and make it more difficult for the company to sell its products 
competition the market for software quality management tools is new  intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
the company expects competition to intensify in the future 
the company currently encounters direct competition from a number of public and private companies including mercury interactive corporation and sqa  inc recently acquired by rational software corporation 
due to the expansion of the market for software quality management tools  the company may face competition from new entrants in the software quality management industry  possibly including the company s resellers or current customers 
there can be no assurance that the company s current and potential competitors will not develop software quality management tools that may be more effective or achieve greater market acceptance than the company s current or future products or that the company s technologies and products would not be rendered obsolete by such developments 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed customer bases  and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
the company may also face increased competition from the recent consolidation of several companies in the automated software quality market 
as a result  these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than the company 
an increase in competition could result in price reductions and loss of market share 
such competition and any resulting reduction in profitability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel the company s success depends upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and sales personnel 
competition for such qualified sales  marketing and software development personnel in the computer industry in general  and the automated software testing industry in particular  is intense 
future results will depend on the company s ability to attract and retain such personnel  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to develop and market competitive products and its ability to achieve projected operating results 
international activities the company derived approximately of its total product sales from international customers in the international market for software products is highly competitive and the company expects to face substantial competition in this market from established and emerging companies 
risks inherent in the company s international business activities also include currency fluctuations  imposition of government controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability  tailoring of products to local requirements  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations 
to the extent that the company is unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  the company s business could be materially adversely affected 
development of indirect channels  potential for channel conflict although the company has not historically sold significant amounts of its products through indirect channels  the company intends to continue to develop channel sales as part of its growth strategy 
in  the company established its channel partner program 
the company licenses its products to its channel partners at a discount and such partners relicense the products to end users 
the company s agreements with its channel partners are non exclusive and provide the channel partners with day price protection 
because the company s channel partners generally order the company s products after they have received purchase orders  there is no requirement that the company repurchase any product 
the company selects its channel partners based on the partner s financial viability  product expertise and market focus 
in order for the company s strategy to broaden market penetration through its channel partner program to be successful  the company must increase its unit sales to offset the discount it is providing the channel partners 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in the development of these channels 
moreover  selling through indirect channels may limit the company s contact with the end users of its products 
as a result  the company s ability to accurately forecast sales  evaluate customer satisfaction and recognize emerging customer requirements may be hindered and its ability to develop and maintain customer goodwill may be limited 
in addition  the company s strategy of marketing its products directly to end users and indirectly through its channel program and through distributors may result in distribution channel conflicts 
although the company has attempted to manage its distribution channels in a manner to avoid potential conflicts  there can be no assurance that channel conflicts will not materially adversely affect its relationships with existing channel partners or distributors or adversely affect its ability to attract new channel partners and distributors 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s resellers will be able to effectively market the company s products or that they will not commence the sale of competitive products 
the company recently entered an oem arrangement with intersolv whereby intersolv has the right to resell qa partner and related products to its customers 
the company has no assurance that this will be a successful sales channel for the company s products or that it will not result in significant channel conflict 
product liability in selling its products  the company relies primarily on shrink wrap licenses that contain  among other things  provisions protecting against the unauthorized use  copying and transfer of the licensed program and limiting the company s exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  these licenses are not signed by the licensees and the provisions of these licenses  including the provisions limiting the company s exposure to product liability claims  may therefore be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
intellectual property and proprietary rights the company currently relies on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights in its products 
the company presently has no registered copyrights 
the company has an approved patent but there can be no assurance that the patent would be upheld if challenged 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
there can also be no assurance that the measures taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of the technology or independent development by others of similar technology 
in addition  the laws of various countries in which the company s products may be sold may not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert intellectual property infringement claims against the company or that any such claims will not require the company to enter into royalty or cross license arrangements or result in costly litigation 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims  such litigation could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is determined in favor of the company 
stock market volatility market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile 
in particular  the market price of the company s common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the computer industry or the securities markets in general 
these factors include  but are not limited to  quarterly variations  announcements of technological innovations by the company or competitors  announcements of mergers or acquisitions by the company or competitors  changes in prices by the company or competitors  change in product mix  and change in revenue or revenue growth rates for geographic areas or products
