item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company develops  markets and supports software products that automate the engineering and sales process 
the company was founded in and initially provided consulting services for customers relating to the automation of the product design process 
in the course of performing these consulting services  the company recognized a market opportunity for software tools to automate the engineering process  and began the development of tools which became the foundation for the icad system 
the company s proprietary software products enable customers to reduce design cycle time and improve quality by automating repetitive engineering processes 
the company funded its early product development efforts and operations through a combination of consulting service revenues and license fees from early customers 
as the company grew  it funded its operations through private equity transactions with corporate partners and product development agreements with computer hardware vendors 
during fiscal  the company began development of its new sales engineering automation product called selling point 
the initial version of selling point was released on june  this development continued through fiscal and will continue as an ongoing development activity 
the company distributes its products and provides related services through a direct sales organization covering north america and has international direct sales organizations in the united kingdom  germany and france

sales to affiliates represented of the company s revenues during fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  sales to affiliates represented and  respectively  of the company s revenues for such years 
the company has experienced and may experience in the future significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in its operating results 
factors such as the timing of significant orders  the timing of new product introductions and upgrades  the length of customer product evaluation periods  the mix of products sold and the mix of domestic versus international revenues could contribute to this quarterly variability 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues in a quarter are derived from purchase orders received in that quarter  which makes the company s financial performance more susceptible to an unexpected downturn in business and more unpredictable 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue levels and a shortfall in expected revenues could therefore result in a disproportionate decrease in the company s net income

in addition  forward looking statements may be included in various other company documents to be issued in the future and in various oral statements by company representatives to security analysts and investors from time to time

the company s future financial performance will depend in part upon the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new or enhanced versions of its existing products and other products 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in marketing the icad system  selling point and related products or any new or enhanced products the company may develop in the future 
in addition  competitive pressures or other factors may result in price erosion that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operation 
see business products 
broader market acceptance 
broader market acceptance of the company s products is critical to the company s future success 
the company believes that broader market acceptance of its products will depend on a number of factors including product functionality  product reliability  price performance characteristics  ease of use and the displacement of existing design approaches 
for many potential customers  the methodology represented in the company s products generally represents a new approach to the design process 
as a result  a decision by a customer to purchase the company s products often involves a significant evaluation period 
failure or material delay of the company s products to achieve broader market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results

there can be no assurance that sales of the company s existing products will either continue at historical rates or increase  or that new products introduced by the company will achieve broad market acceptance 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
concentration of customers 
historically  a significant portion of the company s revenues in any particular period has been attributable to sales to a limited number of customers 
during the fiscal year ended march   three customers each accounted for greater than ten percent of the company s revenues  and revenues from the company s five largest customers during such period represented  in the aggregate  approximately of the company s revenues during such period 
in fiscal  two customers each accounted for greater than ten percent of the company s revenues  and revenues from the company s five largest customers represented approximately of the company s revenues for such year 
in fiscal  three customers each accounted for greater than ten percent of the company s revenues  and revenues from the company s five largest customers including two affiliated entities related to the company which  considered together as a single customer  accounted for of the company s revenues  represented approximately of the company s revenues for such year 
this concentration of customers can cause the company s revenues and earnings to fluctuate from quarter to quarter  based on major customers requirements and the timing of their orders 
although the company believes it has good relationships with its largest customers and has in the past received a substantial portion of its revenues from repeat business with established customers  none of its major customers has any obligation to purchase additional products or services and  thus  there can be no assurance that any of the company s major customers will continue to purchase products and services in amounts similar to previous years 
furthermore  no additional license revenue is due from related parties 
the loss of business from one or more of these customers may have a material adverse impact on the company

competition 
the market in which the company offers its products is highly competitive 
while several major cad companies are involved in cooperative marketing relationships with the company and currently offer products that complement those of the company  there can be no assurance that these or other companies will not develop products or provide services that compete with those offered by the company and that are superior to the company s products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 
in addition  many of the company s competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technological and marketing resources than the company 
competitive pressures faced by the company could force the company to reduce its prices  resulting in slower revenue growth and reduced profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
see business competition 
variability of quarterly operating results 
the company has experienced and may experience in the future significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in its operating results 
factors such as the timing of significant orders  the timing of new product introductions and upgrades  the length of customer product evaluation periods  the mix of products sold and the mix of domestic versus international revenues could contribute to this quarterly variability 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues in a quarter are derived from purchase orders received that quarter  which makes the company s financial performance more susceptible to an unexpected downturn in business and more unpredictable 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue levels and a shortfall in expected revenues could therefore result in a disproportionate decrease in the company s net income 
dependence on third party licensed technology 
certain technology used in the company s products is licensed from third parties 
the company licenses allegro cl  a compiler embedded in the icad system  from franz  inc should this compiler become unavailable to the company  the company believes that it would be able to develop or obtain an alternative compiler  however  the costs of such an effort and the time required could be significant and  until an alternative compiler is developed or obtained  the company s ability to market its products would be substantially impaired 
the company also licenses from electronic data systems eds  a principal customer and marketing partner of the company  a solid modeling software module called parasolid  which is one of the most widely used of the icad system modules 
the loss of the right to use such software could reduce the attractiveness of the company s products to certain customers 
the company believes that alternative solid modeling software is available 
however  there can be no assurances that such alternatives would achieve market acceptance or be available on a timely basis or on similar terms 
the company believes that the cost associated with technology licensed from third parties is not material to its results of operations and does not constitute a significant portion of the total cost of the company s products into which such third party technology is incorporated 
see business proprietary rights 
technological demands of the marketplace 
the market in which the company competes is characterized by rapid technological changes and advances 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products and introduce new products which keep pace with technological developments in the marketplace and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its end users 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in introducing and marketing product enhancements or new products on a timely basis  or that enhancements or new products will achieve market acceptance 
see business products and product development 
dependence on proprietary technology 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technology 
the company does not have patents on any of its technology and relies on contracts and the laws of copyright and trade secrets to protect such technology 
the company maintains a trade secrets program  enters into confidentiality or license agreements with its employees  resellers and end users and limits access to and distribution of its software  documentation and other proprietary information 
effective copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company s products are distributed 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties  or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes the rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company  or that  if asserted  such claims will not prevail 
see business proprietary rights 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends in large part upon a number of key management and technical employees 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees  including lawrence w 
rosenfeld  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company s success will depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled management  technical  and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
see executive officers of the registrant 
management of growth 
the company s business has grown significantly over the past several years as a result of both internal growth and business and product acquisitions 
the company may make additional acquisitions in the future 
managing this growth and integrating acquired products and businesses require a significant amount of management time and skill 
there can be no assurance that the company will be effective in managing its future growth or in assimilating acquisitions or that any failure to manage growth or assimilate an acquisition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
international operations 
the company s international revenues were million  million and million in the fiscal years ended  and respectively  representing  and  respectively  of the company s revenues in such years 
although the company expects that international revenues will fluctuate from period to period  it expects such revenues to account for a significant percentage of its revenues in the future 
the international portion of the company s business is subject to a number of inherent risks  including difficulties in building and managing international operations  difficulties in managing distributors  difficulties in translating products into foreign languages  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  import export duties and quotas and unexpected regulatory  economic or political changes in international markets 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not adversely affect the company s international revenues or its overall financial performance
