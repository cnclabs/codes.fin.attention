item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview effective in fiscal  the company changed its fiscal year to end on the last saturday in december 
the impact on the current year of two fewer days of operations was not material 
the company s profitability has been affected principally by sales volume  slow erosion of gross profit margin  the number of sales people employed  and advertising expenses 
as indicated in the table below under quarterly results  although the company has historically experienced higher sales and higher advertising expenses as a percent of sales in the second through fourth quarters of each year compared to the first quarter of each year  which has resulted in a higher level of profit in the first quarter 
the company prices its beers at a level higher than domestic mass produced beers but at a level consistent with other craft beers 
the company believes that this pricing is appropriate given the quality and reputation of its products 
the company expects that its pricing may become subject to downward pressure as sales volume and competition increase  however  such expectations have not yet been realized in a material way 
in  the company instituted various modest price increases which to date have had a favorable impact on the company s revenue per barrel 
the company s gross profit may be affected by the company s product mix 
seasonal beers tend to be more expensive to produce and the additional expenses may not be fully offset by increased pricing 
increases in sales of seasonal beers  therefore  may reduce the company s gross profit per barrel in certain quarters 
although the company sells its products in bottles and kegs  the annualized mix of the two has remained relatively constant 
a shift toward a higher proportion of keg sales versus bottle sales may not have a negative impact on profit due to the fact that while kegs generate lower revenue per barrel  there is generally a corresponding reduction in the cost of producing keg products  with the exception of the aforementioned seasonal beers 
the financial statements of the company for the periods prior to the recapitalization do not include a provision for income taxes 
prior to the recapitalization  the company operated solely as boston beer company limited partnership 
as a partnership  the income of the company was included in the income tax returns of the partnership s partners 
for information purposes  the statements of income include a pro forma income tax provision on taxable income for financial statement purposes using the effective federal and state rates that would have resulted if the partnership had filed corporate tax returns during those periods 
the company had historically distributed between and of pre tax income to its partners for the purpose of funding their tax obligations 
tax payments by the company following the recapitalization  therefore  have not caused a material change to the company s cash flow or liquidity 
quarterly results the company has historically experienced  and expects to continue experiencing quarterly fluctuations in its sales  operating  and net income 
historically  the company s sales tend to be lower in the first quarter of each year 
sales tend to increase in the third and fourth quarters  while decreasing in the month of december 
the company has also historically expended less on advertising  promotion  and selling expenses in the first quarter 
it should be noted that sales from distributors to retailers are increasing  but at a decreasing rate 
quarterly sales and quarterly spending on advertising  promotion  and selling expenses are shown in the following table which sets forth certain unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the twelve quarters ended december  in management s opinion  this unaudited information includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters
