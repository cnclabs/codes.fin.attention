item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report 
in addition  the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of specifically  the company wishes to alert readers that the factors set forth in certain factors that may affect the company s future results as set forth below in this item  as well as other factors  in the past have affected and in the future could affect the company s actual results  and could cause the company s results for future quarters to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
results of operations fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenues 
total revenues consist primarily of net product sales 
a substantial portion of net product sales has been made through independent distributors 
revenue from product sales to original equipment manufacturers and from sales to distributors  who have no  or limited  product return rights and no price protection rights  is recognized upon shipment net of allowances for estimated returns 
when distributors have rights to return all products and price protection  the company defers revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product 
total revenues decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to price erosion caused by excess supply and other adverse industry wide conditions 
the company s backlog as of april  was its highest end of quarter backlog since april  this improved backlog position notwithstanding  the company is still reliant upon a significant amount of turns orders to meet or exceed its current revenue levels 
this has limited the company s ability to anticipate future demand 
a continuation of weak demand and price erosion for the company s products could lead to continued poor operating results 
international sales contributed of net product sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to price erosion caused by excess supply and other adverse industry wide conditions 
lower cost versions of the company s serial and parallel eeproms  produced on micron processes  and flash memory devices  produced on micron processes  are currently in design or already released to production 
reductions in product cost are expected in the july quarter  when the new lower cost eeprom and flash memory products are expected to begin shipping to customers 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses consist principally of salaries for engineering  technical and support personnel  depreciation of equipment  and the cost of wafers used to evaluate new products and new versions of current products 
r d expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses increased to from 
the increase was primarily attributable to increases in r d personnel costs  facility costs related to the company s move into a new facility in august  depreciation expense  other outside services primarily the company s independent contractors for engineering services in romania and higher material costs for wafers being used to evaluate new products and new versions of current products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist principally of salaries for sales  marketing and administrative personnel  commissions  promotional activities and directors and officers d o insurance 
sg a expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in commissions due to lower revenues and personnel costs 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses increased to from 
this increase was attributable to absolute spending decreasing at a rate lower than the revenue decrease 
net interest expense 
net interest expense was  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal increased borrowings were offset by increased balances in interest bearing cash accounts 
income tax provision 
as a result of the company s loss  the provision for income taxes decreased from  in fiscal to zero in fiscal as of april  the company had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes  expiring from to availability of the net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards may potentially be reduced in the event of substantial changes in equity ownership 
of catalyst semiconductor  inc 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues 
total revenues increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increased revenue from flash memory devices which generated million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase in flash revenues was primarily attributable to higher unit volumes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  three distributors agreed to amend their agreements and thereby waive price protection and certain return rights resulting in recognition of revenue previously deferred of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company experienced a decrease in demand for its products due primarily to industry wide capacity increases and shorter leadtimes on orders 
international sales contributed of net product sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the improvement in fiscal gross profits is primarily attributable to increased revenue levels 
excluding the effect of the fiscal nonrecurring charges see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  fiscal gross profit was higher primarily due to higher revenue levels and higher margins on its flash memory devices due to manufacturing on a lower cost  micron process 
if the flash inventory costs had not been written down in fiscal  then the gross profit would have been million and million lower in fiscal and  respectively 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist principally of salaries for engineering  technical and support personnel  depreciation of equipment  and the cost of wafers used to evaluate new products and new versions of current products 
r d expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses decreased to from 
despite a relatively low increase in absolute spending for r d  the company has significantly increased headcount for r d through the use of an independent contractor in romania see item 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries for sales  marketing and administrative personnel  commissions  promotional activities and directors and officers insurance 
sg a expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to increases in commissions due to higher revenues and royalties 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses decreased to from 
this decrease was attributable to absolute spending increasing at a rate lower than the revenue increase 
net interest expense 
net interest expense was  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal decreased borrowings were offset by decreased balances in interest bearing cash accounts 
income tax provision 
the income tax provision is due primarily to minor state and foreign income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources total cash at april  was million including million of restricted cash  a decrease of million from april  the decrease was primarily attributable to cash used by operations and for the acquisition of capital equipment  offset in part by borrowings from the company s bank line of credit and proceeds from long term borrowings 
as of april   million of the total cash was pledged as security on letters of credit required by certain of the company s wafer foundries 
net cash used by operating activities totaled million in fiscal this use of cash was primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts payable and the company s net loss for the year  offset in part by decreased inventory and accounts receivable balances 
on june   the company entered into an agreement with a bank for the provision of a revolving line of credit which expires on june  and replaced the line of credit which existed at april  under the terms of the agreement  the company can borrow the lesser of million or an amount determined by a formula applied to eligible accounts receivable  local inventory and backlog from certain foreign customers at a variable interest rate of prime plus 
the agreement contains restrictive covenants 
the company borrowed million under the new line of credit on july   a portion of which was used to fully repay the company s existing line of credit 
the company believes that current cash balances  together with cash generated from operations and borrowings available under the company s new bank line of credit and from equipment financing  will be sufficient to fund capital and working capital needs through fiscal thereafter  the company may require additional equity or debt financing to address its working capital needs  to provide funding for capital expenditures or to fund increases to restricted cash requirements 
there of catalyst semiconductor  inc 
can be no assurances  however  that events in the future will not require the company to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that it will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
certain factors that may affect the company s future results the company desires to take advantage of certain provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  enacted in december the reform act that provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company hereby cautions stockholders  prospective investors in the company and other readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s stock price or cause the company s actual results for the fiscal year ending april   for the fiscal quarter ending july   and future fiscal years and quarters to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements  oral or written  made by or on behalf of the company 
the company s business and future operating results are subject to potential fluctuations due to a number of factors including the following fluctuations in operating results 
the company s operating results may be adversely affected or otherwise fluctuate in future quarters due to factors such as timing of new product introductions and announcements by the company and its competitors  changes in product mix  fluctuations in customer demand for the company s products  volatility in supply and demand affecting market prices generally such as the company experienced in fiscal  increased expenses associated with new product introductions or process changes  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  wafer price increases due to foreign currency fluctuations and general economic conditions 
dependence on independent foreign manufacturers  manufacturing risks 
the company does not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for its products 
the company principally utilizes facilities of oki in japan  and is transitioning manufacturing of certain products to umc in taiwan  to fabricate and test the company s wafers  and subcontractors in south east asia to assemble and test finished integrated circuits 
to date  a majority of these wafers and all of the company s flash memory wafers have been manufactured by oki 
the manufacture of semiconductor products is highly complex and sensitive to a wide variety of factors  and as is typical in the semiconductor industry the company s outside wafer foundries from time to time have experienced lower than anticipated production yields 
while the company believes it has an adequate wafer supply to meet its currently anticipated needs  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to receive sufficient quantities of wafers at favorable prices on a timely basis  if at all  or that the company will be able to attain higher levels of wafer supply as demand requires 
material disruptions in the supply of wafers as a result of manufacturing yield or other manufacturing problems are not uncommon in the semiconductor industry 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such problems in the future 
the loss of oki as a supplier  the inability to complete the transition to umc on a timely basis  any prolonged inability to obtain adequate yields or deliveries from oki or other subcontractor manufacturers  or any other circumstance that would require the company to seek alternative sources of supply  could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
moreover  the inability to procure supplies and services from these foreign subcontractor manufacturers on commercially reasonable terms as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company has a wafer purchase agreement with oki that is based upon the exchange rate between the us dollar and japanese yen 
as a result  exchange rate fluctuations will cause the company s cost per die to fluctuate in the future and gross profit could be adversely affected 
in addition  the company s business is subject to other risks generally associated with doing business with foreign subcontractors including  but not limited to  foreign government regulations  political and financial unrest which may cause disruptions or delays in shipments to the company s customers or access to the company s inventories 
new product development and technological change 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technology and product obsolescence  and the timely introduction of new products is a key factor in the success of the company s business 
in particular  the company s future success will depend on its ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies which enable the company to achieve higher product densities 
for example  most of the company s products are currently designed and manufactured using a micron cmos eeprom process or a micron flash memory process 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to select and catalyst semiconductor  inc 
develop new products and technologies and introduce them to the market in a timely manner and with acceptable fabrication yields and production costs 
the company is currently working on major transitions in design and process technologies 
these transitions are to change certain eeprom products from micron to micron designs  flash memory products from micron to micron designs and the development of new flash memory products on micron designs at umc 
delays in developing new products  achieving volume production of new products  successfully completing technology of transitions or the lack of commercial acceptance of new products introduced by the company  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
future capital needs 
the company has had limited cash resources in recent periods and operating activities have consumed significant amounts of cash 
however  the company believes that substantial investments in research and development and sales and marketing expenses are essential to revenue growth and to maintain and enhance the company s competitive position 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations or other sources to fund these investments 
moreover  there can be no assurance that such expenditures will result in successful product introductions or increased revenues 
although certain expenses can be managed or controlled on a short term basis  a substantial portion of such expenses are essentially fixed on a quarter to quarter basis 
as a result  to the extent the company suffers adverse effects to its revenues or margins because of delays in new product introductions  price competition or other competitive factors  the company may be unable to take actions in the short term to substantially reduce expenses 
moreover  in the event that the company may undertake such actions to further reduce expense levels and cash requirements  such actions could adversely affect the company s operations and future operating results 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash to fund research and development investments and sales and marketing expenditures  the company may need to seek additional funds 
there can be no assurance that such funding will be available at favorable terms  if at all 
flash memory market 
the market for flash memory products has been characterized by intense price competition  long production cycles  inconsistent yields  competing technologies and intense overall competition 
the company s fiscal operating results were adversely affected by intense price competition caused by increased supplies of products and other adverse industry wide conditions 
in addition  the company s fiscal operating results were adversely affected by lack of market acceptance of its flash memory products particularly when intel  the dominant supplier in the flash market  significantly increased flash production volume in the second half of fiscal intel and other competitors which include advanced micro devices  atmel  fujitsu  hitachi  mitsubishi  sgs thomson  sharp  texas instruments and toshiba are expected to further increase flash memory production 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain the market acceptance for its flash memory products 
the company anticipates continued price and other competitive pressures  which adversely affected fiscal and operating results and could further adversely affect the company s future operating results 
competition 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and characterized by price erosion  rapid technological change  product obsolescence and patent litigation 
the company competes with major domestic and international semiconductor companies  most of whom have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has been subject to significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production overcapacity 
accordingly  the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions  overall economic conditions or other factors 
for example  the company experienced accelerated erosion of average selling prices caused by adverse industry wide conditions in fiscal and a quick evaporation of demand for the company s flash products in the latter half of fiscal dependence on proprietary technology  risk of intellectual property litigation 
in the semiconductor industry it is typical for companies to receive notices from time to time that allege infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
there can be no assurance that the company will not receive any such notification or that proceedings alleging infringement of intellectual property rights will not be commenced against the company in the future 
in such event  there can be no assurances that the company could obtain any required licenses of third party intellectual property rights or could obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
failure to obtain such a license in any event could require the company to cease production of its products until the company develops a non infringing design or process 
moreover  the cost of litigation of any such claim or damages resulting therefore could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
catalyst semiconductor  inc 
international operations 
in fiscal  and  international sales accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s product sales 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its product sales in the future 
the company s international operations may be adversely affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  imposition of government controls  political and financial instability  trade restrictions  changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing international operations and longer payments cycles 
there can of be no assurance these or other factors related to international operations will not have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
takeover resistive measures 
the company s stockholder rights plan  which provides stockholders with certain rights to acquire shares of common stock in the event of a third party acquires more than of the company s stock  could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
volatility of stock price 
the company s stock price has been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility 
any shortfall in revenues or earnings from levels expected or projected by securities analysts or others could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations particularly affecting the market prices for many high technology companies  and these fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price for the company s common stock
