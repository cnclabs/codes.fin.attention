certain factors affecting future operating results the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results 
competition 
the business information services industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and the entry into the field of extremely large and well capitalized companies as well as smaller competitors 
increased competition  on the basis of price or otherwise  may require price reductions or increased spending on marketing or software development  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see business competition 
dependence on newsedge service 
the company currently derives substantially all of its revenues from newsedge service subscriptions and related royalties 
although the company intends to increase the number of news and other information sources available through newsedge and to otherwise enhance newsedge  the company s strategy is to continue to focus on providing the newsedge service as its sole line of business 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase the number of news sources or otherwise enhance newsedge 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting sales of newsedge would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s future financial performance will depend principally on the market s acceptance of newsedge and the company s ability to sell newsedge to additional customers and to increase revenue derived from existing customers by increasing the number of users within each customer  adding additional newswires or adding additional newsedge servers 
dependence on news providers 
the company currently makes over news and information sources available through newsedge  pursuant to agreements between the company and over different news providers 
a significant percentage of the company s customers subscribe to services provided by one or more of press association inc  a subsidiary of the associated press the associated press  dow jones  the financial times  reuters and thomson 
the company s agreements with news providers are generally for a term of one year  with automatic renewal unless notice of termination is provided before the end of the term by either party 
these agreements may also be terminated by the provider if desktop data fails to fulfill its obligations under the agreement and  under some of the agreements  upon the occurrence of a change in control of the company 
many of these news and information providers compete with one another and  to some extent  with the company 
termination of one or more significant news provider agreements would decrease the news and information which the company can offer its customers and would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
dependence on news transmission sources 
newsedge news and information is transmitted using one or more of three methods leased telephone lines  satellites or fm radio transmission 
none of these methods of news transmission is within the control of the company  and the loss or significant disruption of any of them could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
many newswire providers have established their own broadcast communications networks using one or more of these three vehicles 
in these cases  desktop data s role is to arrange communications between the news provider and the newsedge customer s server 
for sources which do not have their own broadcast communications capability  news and information is delivered to the company s news consolidation facility  where it is reformatted for broadcast to newsedge servers and retransmitted to customers through an arrangement between the company and wavephore wavephore  a common carrier communications vendor 
wavephore is also the communications provider for many newswires offered by the company through newsedge 
the company s agreement with wavephore expired on december   and was extended through december  this agreement can be terminated earlier in the event of a material breach by the company of the agreement 
if the agreement with wavephore were terminated on short notice  or if wavephore were to encounter technical or financial difficulties adversely affecting its ability to continue to perform under the agreement or otherwise  the company s business would be materially and adversely affected 
the company believes that if wavephore were unable to fulfill its obligations  other sources of retransmission would be available to the company  although the transition from wavephore to those sources could result in delays or interruptions of service that could have a material adverse affect on the company s business 
rapid technological change 
the business information services  software and communications industries are subject to rapid technological change  which may render existing products and services obsolete or require significant unanticipated investments in research and development 
the company s future success will depend  in part  upon its ability to enhance newsedge and keep pace with technological developments 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key management  sales and technical personnel  and on its ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
the competition for such employees is intense 
the company has no long term employment contracts with any of its employees 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers  sales people  design engineers or other key personnel or the company s inability to recruit replacements for such personnel or to otherwise attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company maintains million of key man life insurance on donald l 
mclagan  the company s chairman  president and chief executive officer
