calculation of funds from operations management considers funds from operations an appropriate measure of the performance of an equity reit 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income or loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property plus depreciation and amortization excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income or as an alternative to cash flow or as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands net income   addback minority interest   depreciation and amortization   premium on debenture conversion  gain on sale funds from operations   inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the last three years  and as a result  has not had a significant impact on the predecessor or the company during this period 
the lines of credit bear interest at a variable rate  therefore  the amount of interest payable under the lines of credit will be influenced by changes in short term interest rates  which tend to be sensitive to inflation 
to the extent an increase in inflation would result in increased operating costs  such as in insurance  real estate taxes or utilities  substantially all of the tenant s leases require the tenants to absorb these costs as part of their rental obligations 
in addition  inflation also may have the effect of increasing market rental rates
