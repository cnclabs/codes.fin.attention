as of december   the company owned multifamily residential properties  including interests held in two unconsolidated joint ventures 
the company believes that to facilitate a clear understanding of its operating results  funds from operations ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated and combined financial statements 
industry analysts generally consider ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring or sales of property plus depreciation and amortization  after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or the ability to make distributions 
in  the board of governors of nareit approved a revision to the method for computing ffo 
the pre computation method for ffo permits a company to add back to net income all depreciation and amortization in the calculation of ffo 
the current method for computing ffo only permits a company to add back i depreciation of real estate assets and ii amortization of capitalized leasing expenses and tenant allowances or improvements 
items such as amortization of deferred financing fees and depreciation of computer software and a company s office improvements are specifically excluded from the computation and may not be added back to ffo 
the current method for computing ffo has been adopted by the company  and reports of the company for operating periods commencing january  disclose ffo in compliance with the revised computation method 
the following table sets forth the calculations of ffo for the company for the year ended december  under nareit s current computation method
