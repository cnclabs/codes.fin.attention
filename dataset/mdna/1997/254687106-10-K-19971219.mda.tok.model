the company has the capacity to issue up to billion in additional debt under a us shelf registration filed in march  and million under a european medium term note program established in june the company s financial condition remains strong 
the company believes that its cash  other liquid assets  operating cash flows and access to capital markets  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of its investments 
policies and procedures in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies using a variety of financial instruments 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company primarily uses interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to its portfolio of borrowings 
the company maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage  which is set by policy 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on its core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  the company enters into various contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency revenues 
the company uses option strategies which provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable  but not firmly committed  revenues 
the principal currencies hedged are the japanese yen  french franc  german mark  british pound  canadian dollar  italian lira and spanish peseta 
by policy  the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its anticipated foreign exchange exposures for each of the next five years 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
value at risk the company utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques which can be used in the var computation 
the company s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various currencies and interest rates a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at yearend and over each of the four quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during the year 
the model includes all of the company s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives contracts 
the value of foreign exchange options do not change on a one to one basis with the underlying currency  as exchange rates vary 
therefore  the hedge coverage assumed to be obtained from each option has been adjusted to reflect its respective sensitivity to changes in currency values 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the company s financial instruments at september  and 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value  calculated using the var model  follows in millions interest rate currency sensitive financial sensitive financial combined instruments instruments portfolio var as of september  average var during the year ended september  since the company utilizes currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions 
other matters the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
based on preliminary information  costs of addressing potential problems are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
however  if the company  its customers or vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues in a timely manner  it could result in a material financial risk 
accordingly  the company plans to devote the necessary resources to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner
