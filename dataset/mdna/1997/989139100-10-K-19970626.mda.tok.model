item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in millions of canadian dollars  except per share amounts in fiscal  the corporation achieved another year of significant overall revenue growth 
fiscal total revenue was  percent above the total revenue achieved in fiscal and percent above fiscal s total revenue 
the growth was driven primarily by the success of the semiconductor division which continued to experience high demand for the corporation s microelectronics communication components 
in addition  fiscal results reflected the consolidation of mitel semiconductor ab  the swedish semiconductor fab operation  which was acquired at the end of fiscal business communications systems bcs sales showed only modest growth over last year 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management initiated plans to re focus the bcs operations toward improving the sales channels and product time to market activities and at the same time reducing corporate support costs 
to carry out this plan  the corporation recorded a  or per share  restructuring and other charge to operating expenses in the fourth quarter 
after recording the charge  the corporation reported fiscal net income of  or per share  less than the prior fiscal year when net income was  or per share  but  or per share better than fiscal s net income 
net income for the three fiscal years ended march   march  and march  as determined by us accounting principles is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion and analysis explains trends in the corporation s financial condition and results of operations for the year ended march  compared with the two previous years  and is intended to help shareholders and other readers understand the dynamics of the corporation s business and the key factors underlying its financial results 
the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements and supplementary information constitute an integral part of and should be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis 
the corporation s fiscal year end is the last friday in march 
normally this results in a fifty two week year with four thirteen week quarters 
for fiscal  the year end of the corporation was march   which resulted in a fifty three week year with one additional week occurring in the first quarter of that year 
accordingly  part of the change in revenue  associated costs  and expenses may be attributed to one additional week in fiscal compared to fiscal years and results of operations mitel s business is global and comprises the design  manufacture and sale of systems  subsystems and microelectronic components to world markets in the telephony  computer telephony integration cti and communications industries 
these products and related services include voice communications systems  networked voice and data systems and cti applications  client server telecom products  public switching systems  network enhancement and access products  integrated and hybrid circuits  optoelectronic devices and custom silicon wafers 
the corporation sells its products through both direct and indirect channels of distribution 
factors affecting the choice of distribution  among others  include end customer type  the level of product complexity and integration requirements  the stage of product introduction  geographic presence and location of markets  and volume levels 
revenue during the last five fiscal years  based on the geographic location of mitel s customers  was distributed as follows revenue millions cdn canada other regions europe united states the net movement in exchange rates from fiscal favorably impacted total revenue by percent as a result of changes in the united states dollar and united kingdom pound sterling exchange rates 
fiscal revenue was positively impacted by one percent  when compared with fiscal  as a result of changes in the united states dollar and united kingdom pound sterling exchange rates 
business communications systems bcs revenue millions cdn service products business communications systems bcs comprise pbx equipment and peripherals  cti products and applications  client server telecom products  call controller products  the gx  and radicall 
all of the corporation s service revenue relates to business communications systems  primarily pbx 
fiscal bcs revenue  in total  was  a percent increase from fiscal s figure of fiscal results reflected improved sales across all regions in which the corporation operates  despite intense competitive pressures 
compared to last year  bcs product revenue increased by percent to due to increased european demand for the corporation s call controller products  improved sales of cti applications in all markets  and higher sx sales to us supply houses and dealers 
with respect to call controllers  european sales increased in fiscal as a result of deregulated network access services in the uk which created a strong demand by alternate carriers for mitel s call controllers 
in fiscal  the north american bcs performance recovered slightly due to marketing programs and sales initiatives introduced late in fiscal to meet the intensifying competitive challenges 
the recovery was evidenced by growth in line shipments in the us market 
in particular  sales into us supply houses were up  also benefiting from the strength of a healthy economy in that country 
in addition  sales of central office equipment improved over fiscal as mitel increased its share of the independent telephone company market 
overall  fiscal lines shipped increased by percent over lines shipped in fiscal this increase was mostly attributable to the higher product sales in the indirect sales channels 
these increases were offset partially by lower new installations through the corporation s direct sales channels in both the us and in europe 
market share in the us  based on total lines shipped  improved to percent in calendar  up percentage points from calendar based on market research published by phillips infotech 
in the uk  mitel s second biggest market for bcs products  market share  based on new lines shipped  increased to percent in calendar  up percentage points from calendar based on market research published by marketing services 
bcs service revenue decreased by percent from last year to  mainly as a consequence of the sale of all of the corporation s north american non mitel pbx and key system customer base and the sale of certain uk maintenance contracts to other service providers mid way through fiscal as expected  in proportion to total revenue  bcs service revenue decreased by one percentage point to approximately percent as a result of disposing of these revenue streams 
cti revenue benefited in the year from efforts made in fiscal to train the corporation s voice system sales force and distribution channels for the cti convergence products and applications migration  but the improvement was only modest as the market has not responded to cti opportunities as quickly as management and industry analysts had expected 
management remains committed to cti and the broader convergence category of a combined telecommunications and information technology 
the corporation intends to use core competency in voice products to play a major role in these new markets 
management believes mitel is well positioned to succeed in the convergence market by providing voice solutions as an application over corporate lans as well as other cti products including call center applications 
the corporation plans to continue marketing voice products in the corporation s core markets as well as working with strategic partners to take advantage of new opportunities in the information technology industry 
on january   the corporation acquired for cash consideration of the business and assets of global village communication uk limited  an integrated service digital network isdn solution provider based in the united kingdom 
the acquired product line currently consists of leading edge isdn access products and technologies which allow for high volume digital communications between head office  local branches  home workers and agents in the field in a cost effective manner 
this product line complements mitel s open and distributed architecture of business communications solutions and mitel s initiative in bringing telecommunications and computer technology together 
revenue for fiscal was not significantly impacted by this acquisition 
mitel s bcs focus in asia pacific continued to be its joint venture located in tianjin  china  and mitel far east limited 
in fiscal  mitel increased the localization of manufacturing mitel product by the joint venture for the china market 
however  bcs revenue growth for this region has not met with management expectations due  in part  to the effects of tight monetary policies and intense price competition in china 
management remains confident in the long term prospects of this region  but has determined it prudent to record a write off of its investment in the joint venture as part of the restructuring and other charges described in the following paragraph 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the corporation announced plans to restructure its bcs operations in light of the competitive conditions in the market place and the need to curtail certain non profitable activities 
a total charge of was recorded to the corporation s operating expenses 
this charge included an amount of for the write off of the corporation s investment and related assets in tianchi mitel telecommunication corporation tmtc  the corporation s joint venture in tianjin  china 
the remaining was provided primarily for termination benefits  related to bcs operations in north america and the united kingdom  which will result in a net cash outlay by the corporation over the next twelve months 
these cash outflows will be funded through the corporation s cash provided from operations 
in addition  as part of its restructuring plans  the corporation determined to curtail further development of its radicall products 
during the last few years  the corporation rolled out radicall product to regional bell operating companies and public network operators in the us and  more recently  into the united kingdom 
however  management believes the inroads made to date have not been sufficient to justify further development of the product  although the corporation plans to support the product for existing customers 
in addition  management is working to streamline the major sales  service and distribution channels and to reduce supporting corporate expenses 
management expects to realize annualized savings to operating expenses of approximately within the next fiscal year 
fiscal bcs revenue decreased by percent to from fiscal s revenue of fiscal reflected mixed results with highly competitive market conditions having a negative impact on bcs revenue  particularly in north america 
in fiscal  bcs product revenue decreased by percent 
in addition  fiscal lines shipped decreased by percent over lines shipped in fiscal causing market share to decline slightly in calendar european revenue grew on the strength of upgrades and expansion sales to its installed base  call center application sales  and higher maintenance service revenue 
the asia pacific region  included in other geographic markets  maintained its revenue base under highly competitive conditions 
revenue also decreased in fiscal due to the sale of mitel s non core pbx and key system base and certain service contracts to other distributors mid way through that year 
in fiscal  bcs service revenue increased by percent over fiscal due to higher maintenance and service revenue in the european region which resulted in part from the one time sale of certain maintenance contracts to other service providers 
in fiscal  the corporation eliminated its direct bcs sales operations in italy and germany due to poor performance in those countries and recorded a restructuring charge in that year to complete the closing of offices and termination of staff 
the italian and german restructuring was initiated in the second quarter of fiscal and was substantially completed by the end of that year 
semiconductors as a percentage of total revenue  semiconductors accounted for percent  percent and percent  respectively  in fiscal years  and semiconductor revenue in millions cdn semiconductors semiconductor revenue showed successive annual growth rates of percent and percent  respectively  in fiscal and in fiscal the revenue growth was the result of the additional revenue from mitel semiconductor ab  which was acquired at the end of fiscal  and increased demand for the corporation s integrated circuits  wafers and thick film hybrid products in all regions 
the increase in mitel s semiconductor business reflects the worldwide growth in the communications segment of the semiconductor industry 
mitel is experiencing growth in countries where there is a demand for mitel s line of communications components from manufacturers of advanced voice  data and multimedia equipment in north america  asia and europe 
increased demand for communications products incorporating existing mitel semiconductor components by the corporation s traditional customer base  along with the introduction of new components  including those intended for cti multimedia applications  led to increased sales volumes compared to last year 
the corporation took major steps in fiscal to expand its production capacity through both the acquisition of mitel semiconductor ab  which has a semiconductor plant in jarfalla  sweden  and a major capital expansion program at its fabrication plant in bromont  quebec  canada 
both initiatives were necessary to meet the growing demand for mitel s integrated circuits 
the most significant part of the first phase of the bromont expansion program  which concerns the improvement of the volume capacity of the existing mm wafer production  was completed during the first quarter of fiscal the second part of the first phase  which will introduce new micron technology  will be completed during the second quarter of fiscal the second phase  intended to increase the plant s production capacity by converting to mm wafer production  is scheduled to be completed in the beginning of calendar the estimated time to complete the second phase is approximately one fiscal quarter later than originally planned 
subsequent to the acquisition of mitel semiconductor ab  management concluded that the thermal print head tph portion of the business was not strategic to the corporation s interests 
on october   the corporation sold the tph operation  including related inventory  fixed assets and certain intellectual property rights to a german distributor 
the sale of the business did not have a significant impact on the corporation s financial position or results of operations for fiscal and will not have a significant impact on the corporation s financial position or results of operations in the future 
gross margin as a percentage of total revenue  the total gross margin for the year was percent  one percentage point higher than fiscal  and five percentage points higher than fiscal margins were strong primarily due to a good mix of higher margin products sold  particularly in semiconductors  high sales volumes  and cost efficiencies obtained in the manufacturing plants 
product gross margin was percent in fiscal as against percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal service gross margin was percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal product gross margins improved each year due to changes in the sales mix with a higher proportion of semiconductors and high value applications 
in addition  manufacturing efficiencies were achieved each year on higher semiconductor volumes through the plant and cost reductions achieved in manufactured system products 
fiscal service gross margins were lower than in fiscal when service gross margins benefited from the sale and transfer of certain uk maintenance contracts to bailey telecom limited 
operating expenses selling and administrative selling and administrative s a expenses increased in fiscal to from in fiscal as a percentage of sales  fiscal s a expenses were percent  the same as in fiscal and fiscal s a expenses were higher than in fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of the results of operations of mitel semiconductor ab 
in addition  operating expenses increased due to higher costs associated with new marketing initiatives and product launches with respect to cti applications  work group solutions  pc telephony and in support of the nevada networked voice and data product  costs associated with higher sales volumes and higher product support costs 
the marketing related costs included increased trade show activity  new corporate communications material  course development for dealers and end customers  and an increase in head count 
fiscal s a expenses decreased over fiscal primarily as a result of closing the italian and german direct pbx sales operations and improved operating efficiencies in the us sales organization 
additionally in accordance with a research and development r d contract with british telecommunications plc bt  the requirement to pay bt levies on sx product sales expired on march  in fiscal  levies of were included in s a expenses for which there was no corresponding amount in fiscal the benefit of these savings discussed above helped to offset higher costs associated with new marketing initiatives and product launches  and incentives associated with the improved earnings performance in fiscal research and development r d expenses millions cdn research development r d expenses were and percent of revenue for the year ended march  this compares to and  and both at percent of revenue  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these amounts were exclusive of related r d capital asset amortization and net of government r d incentives earned in each year 
r d increased as a percentage of sales compared to last year mainly due to the inclusion of mitel semiconductor ab which currently has a significant program for new integrated circuits and optoelectronic components 
government r d incentives earned and included in r d expenses amounted to in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal in addition  the corporation recorded of canadian investment tax credits not previously recognized relating to prior years r d which compares to recorded in fiscal mitel s r d program integrates its programs for existing products with development work in emerging technologies including  among others  the following cti  multimedia components and applications  networked voice and data  client server telecom  new isdn applications  and real time application specific microelectronic components 
amortization amortization increased in fiscal to from and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase over fiscal was due primarily to the inclusion of mitel semiconductor ab s results of operations  upgrades made to the corporation s other manufacturing plants  and a major semiconductor capacity expansion program 
similarly  the increase in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to ongoing replacements and upgrades to the corporation s semiconductor and other manufacturing plants during the latter part of fiscal and throughout fiscal investment and interest income on september   the corporation sold a non strategic investment in esprit telecom jersey ltd 
esprit  a company which provides value added network services through leased lines to european based corporate accounts 
the esprit investment was sold for cash proceeds of  representing a total gain of  or after tax 
the gain has been excluded from operating income in fiscal interest income was for fiscal compared to and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal resulted from lower canadian interest rates and from lower average cash balances available for investment 
cash balances available for investment were reduced due to the acquisition of mitel semiconductor ab for on the last day of fiscal this acquisition was financed in its entirety from the corporation s cash resources 
the increase in interest income in fiscal over fiscal resulted from higher average cash balances available for investment and higher interest rates in fiscal relative to fiscal interest expense interest expense was for fiscal compared to and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in interest expense over the past three years resulted from an increase in the corporation s capital leases 
income taxes income tax expense for fiscal was compared to and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the corporation follows the cost reduction method to account for investment tax credits itcs 
accordingly the itcs  related to prior years research and development  were applied against research and development expenses and tax expense was increased by a corresponding amount 
consequently  the combination of accruing for the itcs and the incremental tax expense resulted in an insignificant impact to net earnings or earnings per share 
before accounting for the investment tax credits  income tax expense for fiscal was compared to for fiscal and for fiscal resulting in an effective tax rate of percent  percent and percent respectively 
the increased tax expense in fiscal was due to higher taxable earnings in the uk  primarily as a result of the gain on the sale of esprit and to higher taxes in canada for higher provincial taxable income as a result of claiming investment tax credits 
the increased tax expense in fiscal was due primarily to the earnings improvement in the corporation s uk operations 
at the end of fiscal  the corporation had tax loss carryforwards of  investment tax credit carryforwards of and timing differences of approximately no accounting benefit has been recognized in respect of these carryforwards due to the lack of virtual certainty or reasonable assurance  as applicable  of realizing the benefits from the operations in which the carryforwards and timing differences arose 
management periodically reviews the virtual certainty or reasonable assurance  as applicable  of realizing the carryforward and timing difference benefits in the determination of their accounting recognition 
such review may  in the future  result in the recording of the accounting benefit for these timing differences and investment tax credit carryforwards  as the circumstances warrant  and the recognition of loss carryforwards  as realized 
other management periodically evaluates the financial and operational independence of its foreign operations and the resulting accounting classification of the foreign subsidiaries as self sustaining enterprises 
should a foreign subsidiary cease to be classified as self sustaining  then translation gains or losses on consolidating the foreign subsidiary s financial statements would be charged to operating income instead of a separate component of shareholders equity 
the corporation manages foreign currency risk by protecting the estimated future foreign currency cash flows of each operating division  and certain significant transactions from adverse foreign exchange fluctuations 
the corporation does not engage in a trading or speculative hedging program 
the corporation believes that inflation has not had a material impact on revenues and costs during the last three fiscal years 
backlog as orders are frequently booked and shipped within the same fiscal month  order backlog is not necessarily indicative of a sales outlook for the month  quarter  or year 
this is most true for the corporation s business communications systems although manufacturing lead times for semiconductor products are generally longer because of the nature of the production process 
at march   order backlog was compared to at march  and at march  the decrease in backlog from the end of fiscal was mainly attributable to the effects of the sale of the thermal print head business in the third quarter of fiscal these decreases were offset partially by an improvement in the corporation s north american bcs indirect sales channel 
most of the backlog is scheduled for delivery in the next twelve months 
backlog millions cdn order backlog the acquisition of mitel semiconductor ab at the end of fiscal accounted for most of the increase to the corporation s total backlog outstanding at march  as compared to the end of fiscal liquidity and capital resources the corporation had cash and short term investment balances of at march  compared to at march  the increase of from the end of fiscal was due to cash flow provided by operations 
cash flow provided by operations amounted to during the year ended march  this compares to fiscal and fiscal when cash provided by operations was and  respectively 
since march   the corporation s working capital decreased by to due primarily to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by an increase in inventory and accounts receivable levels 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities were higher at year end due to increased inventory purchasing activity to support increased sales levels and additional provisions for the corporation s restructuring program 
cash outflows related to the restructuring and other provisions were not significant in fiscal inventory increased by since last year to bring levels in line with the expected operating requirements 
the corporation maintains a minimum amount of critical inventory to ensure continuity of supply for its manufacturing requirements 
most of the security supply inventory is carried at the corporation s semiconductor plants 
as at march   the security supply inventory was compared to at march  accounts receivable increased over last year due to the higher sales levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal fixed asset additions were during fiscal  and were primarily for the increase in semiconductor manufacturing capacity and technology enhancements as well as upgrades to the corporation s information technology resources 
the semiconductor capital program is comprised of two phases 
phase one  which commenced in the third quarter of fiscal and was completed during the first quarter of fiscal  except for the introduction of the new micron technology which will be completed in the second quarter of fiscal  cost approximately and phase two scheduled to be completed during early calendar is expected to cost approximately approximately has been spent on phase two as at the end of fiscal as at march   there were approximately in capital expenditure purchase orders outstanding related to the bromont expansion program 
management expects that fiscal capital expenditures will be lower than fiscal levels 
subsequent to year end  the corporation entered into an agreement to sell the boca raton facility  which was previously held as an asset for resale 
the proceeds from the sale of approximately will be used to extinguish the florida industrial revenue bonds amounting to as at march  to which the facility was pledged as security 
management expects the sale of the facility would not have a significant impact on the results of operations 
on january   the corporation acquired the business and assets of global village communication uk limited  an isdn solution provider based in the united kingdom  for cash consideration of the acquisition was financed in its entirety by the corporation s own cash resources 
goodwill of was recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired  which will be amortized on a straight line basis over the next five years 
total long term debt increased  net of repayments  by from the end of fiscal the increase was due to new capital leases partially offset by a repayment in full of the advances received under the ontario loan agreement of the ontario government loan would have become subject to interest commencing on march  at an annual rate of percent 
in light of the lower rates of interest that the corporation could obtain through other lending sources  management decided to repay the loan in its entirety before interest expense would begin to accrue 
the pension liability of relates to the unfunded pension obligation in mitel semiconductor ab which was acquired on march  under applicable swedish law  companies are not required to fund the pension obligation  but instead operate on a pay as you go basis 
the pension obligation is actuarially determined in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in sweden and is fully insured by a swedish regulatory agency 
at the end of fiscal  the corporation s capitalization was comprised of percent debt  percent preferred equity  and percent common equity 
this compares to the end of fiscal when the corporation s capitalization profile was percent debt  percent preferred equity  and percent common equity 
in addition to cash and short term investment balances of  the corporation has unused lines of credit in north america and the uk of approximately in accordance with corporation policy  short term investment balances are primarily comprised of high grade money market instruments with original maturity dates of less than one year 
management believes that the corporation is in a position to meet all foreseeable business cash requirements and debt service from its cash balances on hand  existing financing facilities and cash flow from operations
