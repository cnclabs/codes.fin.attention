the company anticipates making payments of approximately  under the agreements which were in effect as of february  provided that there is adequate financing  the amount of the company s obligations under research agreements can be expected to increase

cato s services are paid for with a combination of cash and common stock 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and working capital of  the company currently anticipates that the available cash  cash equivalents  and investments will be sufficient to fund operations through the first quarter of however  the company may be required to obtain additional financing to continue operations during such period in the event of cost overruns or unanticipated expenses 
the company has experienced delays in funding its planned research and development activities and will require substantial additional funds to finance its business activities on an ongoing basis 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including  but not limited to  progress in its research and development programs  including preclinical and clinical trials  costs of filing and prosecuting patent applications and  if necessary  enforcing issued patents or obtaining additional licenses of patents  competing technological and market developments  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the ability of the company to establish collaborative relationships  and the cost of establishing manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities 
the company has no current commitment to obtain additional funding and is unable to state the amount or potential source of such additional funds 
moreover  because of the company s potential long term capital requirements  it may undertake additional equity offerings whenever conditions are favorable  even if it does not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional funding when needed  or that such funding  if available  will be obtainable on reasonable terms 
any such additional funding may result in significant dilution to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate research and development programs  capital expenditures  and other operating expenses 
the company may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners that may require the company to relinquish certain material rights to its products that it would not otherwise relinquish 
the company s ability to raise funds is likely to be adversely affected if it is unable to continue to meet the listing criteria on the nasdaq smallcap market 
the nasdaq smallcap market listing criteria requires a minimum of  in total assets and a minimum capital and surplus of  the company s assets fell below the required minimum during the third quarter of the listing qualifications committee of nasdaq granted the company a temporary exception from such requirements subject to meeting certain conditions  one of which was the private placement of the series a preferred stock no later than february  on march   the company was notified that it had satisfied the requirements for continued listing 
if the company is unable to raise sufficient funds when needed  thereby allowing it to remain in compliance with the listing requirements  the company will either have to significantly reduce its operations  particularly its research and development  or it will cease to be in compliance during such period 
if the company becomes unable to meet such criteria and is delisted from nasdaq  trading  if any  in the common stock would thereafter be conducted in the over the counter market in the so called pink sheets or  if then available  the national association of securities dealers inc s electronic bulletin board 
if delisting occurs  the company s securities may also become penny stock as defined in the securities exchange act of  as amended  which may also adversely affect the company s ability to raise funds 
as a result  an investor would likely find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations as to the value of  the company s securities 
the company anticipates that the proceeds of the private placement of units concluded in july and august will enable the company to satisfy the minimum asset requirement for continued listing through
