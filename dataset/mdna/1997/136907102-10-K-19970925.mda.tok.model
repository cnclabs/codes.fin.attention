new business strategic development 
while the company continues to expand and diversify its core cosmetic and surgical laser equipment business  the company has embarked on a new business strategy of opening combined spa and laser cosmetic skin care centers 
currently  the company operates combined spa skin care facilities in boston  massachusetts and scottsdale  arizona 
the company s skin care treatment center previously located in framingham  massachusetts has been combined with the spa in boston to create a combination spa skin care facility 
additionally  the company has entered into a joint venture with egyptian investors to open a new laser cosmetic center in cairo  egypt 
the surgical skin care treatments performed in each location are administered by board certified physicians under contract with the company s wholly owned subsidiary  cscc 
while the target audience for the company s core laser equipment tends to be medical practice groups and other health care providers  its target audience for its spa and skin care centers are individuals who are typically reached through entirely different marketing efforts 
the cost structures  new client accretion methods and other demands associated with the company s new facilities are largely untested  and the company could incur significant losses in connection with its spa and skin care centers 
governmental regulation 
medical devices are subject to approval before they can be utilized for clinical studies or sold commercially 
in addition  the company s activities in connection with its cscc business may subject the company to additional regulation under state and federal laws 
the process for obtaining the necessary approvals and compliance with applicable regulations can be costly and time consuming 
many foreign countries in which the company markets or may market its products have similar regulatory bodies and restrictions 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any such government approvals or successfully comply with any such regulations in a timely and cost effective manner  if at all  and failure to do so may have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with product liability 
the administration of medical and cosmetic treatments using laser products is subject to various risks of physical injury to the patient which may result in product liability or other claims against the company 
the costs and resources involved in defending or settling any such claims  or the payment of any award in connection therewith  may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company maintains product liability insurance  but there is no assurance that its policy will provide sufficient coverage for any claim or claims that may arise  or that the company will be able to maintain such insurance coverage on favorable economic terms 
rapid technological change  competition 
the medical laser industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations 
the company  to be successful  must be responsive to new developments in laser technology and applications of existing technology  and the company s financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected by the failure of new or existing products to compete favorably in response to such technological developments 
in addition  the company competes against numerous other companies offering products similar to the company s and or alternative products and technologies  some of which have greater financial  marketing and technical resources than the company 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to compete successfully 
in addition  the company s cscc operations face a host of competitors including hair salons  health spas  massage therapists  aestheticians  health and fitness clubs  personal trainers  dermatologists  plastic surgeons  cosmetic laser centers and cosmetic retailers 
the company also believes its cscc operations will face competition from laser manufacturing companies that have  or may develop  plans to open facilities based on concepts similar to the candela laserspa tm concept 
such competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  even if the company is able to successfully compete  there can be no assurance that it would be able to do so in a profitable manner 
reliance on attracting and retaining key employees 
the company s success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  technical  managerial  sales and marketing  management and other personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and any decline in the company s ability to attract and retain such personnel may have adverse effects on its financial condition and operating results
