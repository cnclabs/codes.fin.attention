item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general a significant portion of jrm s revenues and operating results are derived from its foreign operations 
as a result  jrm s operations and financial results are affected by international factors  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
jrm attempts to minimize its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates by attempting to match foreign currency contract receipts with like foreign currency disbursements 
to the extent that it is unable to match the foreign currency receipts and disbursements related to its contracts  its practice of entering into forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions reduces the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on operating results 
revenues of jrm are largely a function of the level of oil and gas development activity in the world s major hydrocarbon producing regions 
consequently  revenues reflect the variability associated with the timing of significant development projects 
jrm s operating results have been adversely affected by a substantial decline in significant projects in southeast asia  and low margins in all of its other major markets 
jrm expects improvements in its markets  especially in southeast asia and the gulf of mexico 
consolidated backlog has increased significantly and there have been some pricing improvements 
the foregoing statements regarding jrm s markets and other statements in this discussion are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
these include the uncertainties relating to offshore development decisions to be made by oil and gas exploration and development companies 
fiscal year vs fiscal year revenues increased  to  primarily due to higher volume in north america  the middle east and the far east 
these were partially offset by lower volume in the north sea and lower leasing revenues due to the sale of the db and db to the heeremac joint venture 
operating income by geographic area increased  to  net gains on asset disposals  after deduction for certain writedowns of asset valuations  were  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year excluding these net gains  operating income decreased  the decrease was primarily due to lower volume in the north sea  lower leasing activities due to the sale of the db and db  lower margins in the far east  and the completion of profitable contracts in west africa in the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by higher volume in north america and in the middle east 
equity in income loss of investees decreased  from income of  to a loss of  this decrease was primarily due to lower results from the mcdermott etpm west  inc joint venture 
revenues of the mcdermott etpm west  inc joint venture increased  to  in fiscal year primarily due to increased volume in the north sea and west africa 
equity in income of this joint venture decreased  to a loss of  in fiscal year primarily due to lower margins in west africa

interest income increased  to  primarily due to interest on the promissory note received as part of the consideration from the sale of the db and db interest expense decreased  to  primarily due to changes in debt obligations and interest rates prevailing thereon 
other net income increased  to  primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains in the current year compared to foreign currency transaction losses in the prior year 
the provision for income taxes increased  to  while income before provision for income taxes decreased  to  jrm operates in many different tax jurisdictions 
within these jurisdictions  tax provisions vary because of nominal rates  allowability of deductions  credits and other benefits  and even tax basis for example  revenue versus income 
these variances  along with variances in the mix of income within jurisdictions  are responsible for shifts in the effective tax rate 
fiscal year vs fiscal year revenues increased  to  primarily due to higher purchased engineered equipment and subcontract activities in the north sea related to the bp exploration foinaven development program west of the shetlands in the north atlantic  higher revenues in north america and revenues resulting from the acquisition of opi 
these increases were partially offset by lower revenues in the far east 
operating income by geographic area decreased  to  primarily due to higher amortization expense relating to goodwill and other intangibles resulting from the acquisition of opi on january  there were also lower margins due to the completion of higher profit margin contracts in the far east and the middle east during fiscal year  lower volume in the far east this year  lower operating income in north america on offshore activities because of weather downtime and lower margins on certain contracts 
this decrease was partially offset by higher volume and margins in north america on fabrication activities this year 
in addition  there were operating losses associated with the fabrication yard in scotland and accelerated depreciation of  on certain marine equipment in the far east in the prior year 
equity in income of investees decreased  to  this decrease was primarily due to lower results from both the heeremac and mcdermott etpm west  inc joint ventures 
the revenues of these two joint ventures declined from  to  primarily in the gulf of mexico  the far east and the north sea  partially offset by increased volume in west africa 
the equity income from these two joint ventures declined from  to  as a result of reduced volume and margins in the north sea 
together these two significant investees accounted for of equity earnings of investees 
equity income in fiscal year benefited from the inclusion of the results of the cmm mexican joint venture which was not a part of jrm s marine construction services business in the prior period and higher operating activity from the brown root mcdermott fabricators limited joint venture which was formed in the last quarter of the prior year 
interest income decreased  to  primarily due to settlement of claims for interest relating to foreign tax refunds and contract claims of  in the prior year 
interest expense increased  to  primarily due to interest on the guaranteed senior notes which were assumed in connection with the acquisition of opi  and changes in other debt obligations and interest rates prevailing thereon

the provision for income taxes decreased  to  while income before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting changes decreased  to  the reduction in income taxes is primarily due to a decrease in income and a reappraisal of approximately  of liabilities in certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
effects of inflation and changing prices jrm s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  using historical dollar accounting historical cost 
statements based on historical cost  however  do not adequately reflect the cumulative effect of increasing costs and changes in the purchasing power of the dollar  especially during times of significant and continued inflation 
the management of jrm is cognizant of the effects of inflation and  in order to minimize the negative impact of inflation on its operations  attempts to cover the increased cost of anticipated changes in labor  material and service costs  either through an estimation of such changes  which is reflected in an original price  or through price escalation clauses in its contracts 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal year  jrm s cash and cash equivalents decreased  to  and total debt decreased  to  primarily due to a net reduction in short term borrowings of  during this period  jrm provided cash of  from operating activities and received cash of  from the issuance of long term debt   from asset disposals and  from returns from investees 
jrm used cash of  for net purchases of short term investments   for additions to property  plant and equipment   for repayment of long term debt  and  for dividends on jrm s preferred stock 
cash from asset disposals includes proceeds of  from the sale of jrm s interest in ccc fabricaciones y construcciones  sa de sa  a mexican joint venture  derrick barges and other assets to global industries  ltd 
and proceeds of  from the sale of a marine vessel by heeremac on behalf of jrm 
higher accounts receivable are primarily due to the timing of collection of billings on contracts performed in the middle east 
decreases in net contracts and advance billings were primarily due to the timing of billings on the foinaven contract and on contracts performed in the middle east 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment increased  to  in fiscal year the majority of expenditures incurred in fiscal year were to maintain  replace and upgrade existing facilities and equipment 
jrm has committed to make capital expenditures of  during fiscal year at march  and  jrm had available various uncommitted short term lines of credit from banks totaling  and  respectively 
borrowings by jrm against these lines of credit at march  and were  and  respectively 
jrm is also a party to an unsecured and committed revolving credit facility the jrm revolver with a group of banks 
there were no borrowings outstanding at march  and under the jrm revolver 
as a condition to borrowing under the facility  jrm must comply with certain requirements 
presently  jrm cannot satisfy these requirements and cannot borrow under the jrm revolver 
the jrm revolver also limits the amount of funds which jrm can borrow from other sources and jrm is currently at such limits 
however  it is not anticipated jrm will need to borrow funds under the jrm revolver during fiscal year jrm is restricted  as a result of covenants in its credit agreements  in paying cash dividends to its public shareholders or in transferring funds through cash dividends including annual cash dividends of  on its series a preferred stock held by international or through unsecured loans to or investments in international 
at march   jrm could pay no cash dividends to its common stockholders  including international  could pay up to  of cash dividends on its series a preferred stock held by international  and could make unsecured loans to or investments in international of approximately  working capital decreased  to  at march  due  in part  to the classification of jrm s guaranteed senior notes as a current liability due to jrm s decision to redeem such notes on july  during  jrm expects to obtain funds to meet capital expenditure  working capital and debt maturity requirements from operating activities  cash and cash equivalents and investments in debt securities 
leasing agreements for equipment  which are short term in nature  are not expected to impact jrm s liquidity or capital resources 
jrm joint ventures are largely financed through their own resources  including  in some cases  stand alone borrowing arrangements 
during fiscal year and  jrm paid dividends of  on its series a preferred stock and  during fiscal year  jrm paid dividends of  on its series b preferred stock 
jrm has annual preferred stock dividend requirements of  on its series a preferred stock 
at march   the ratio of long term debt to total stockholders equity was as compared with at march  jrm has provided a valuation allowance  at march  for deferred tax assets which cannot be realized through carrybacks and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
management believes that remaining deferred tax assets are realizable through carrybacks and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income 
an uncertainty that affects the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is the risk of incurring losses in the future 
this factor has been considered in determining the valuation allowance 
management will continue to assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
new accounting standard in february  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 earnings per share  which is required to be adopted on december  at that time  jrm will be required to change the method currently used to compute earnings per share and to restate all prior periods 
under the new requirements for calculating basic earnings per share  the dilutive effect of stock options and stock appreciation rights will be excluded 
for the fiscal years and  the new standard will have no impact on previously reported amounts
