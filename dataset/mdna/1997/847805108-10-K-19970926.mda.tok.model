copyguard was developing a computer generated matrix to invisibly mark garments to prevent counterfeiting 
however  its continuing cash requirements were diverting funds from the company s core business while prospects of bringing the system to market  successfully  were diminishing

all such forward looking statements are subject to the safe harbor created by the private securities litigation reform act of important factors that could cause financial performance to differ materially from past results and from those expressed and implied in this document include  without limitation  the risks of acqusition of businesses including limited knowledge of the businesses acquired and misrepresentations by sellers availability of financing  competition  management s ability to manage growth  loss of customers  and a variety of other factors 
the company s operations require a substantial line of letters of credit to cover its customers orders 
at june   the company s credit facility provides for an overall facility of million for letters of credit  including up to million in revolving funds 
this facility  originally due to expire on october   has been refinanced in conjunction with the purchase of all of the outstanding common stock of wink davis equipment company 
the company entered into a new credit facility on august  this facility provides up to million comprised of a a million term loan with quarterly principal payments of  beginning december   the balance due july   and b up to million for letters of credit  including up to million in revolving funds 
amounts outstanding under the line of credit bear interest at the greater of prime plus or the federal funds effective rate plus for base rate loans and the  or day libor rate plus for libor loans 
in connection with this line of credit  the company granted a security interest in accounts receivable and inventory 
working capital at june  was million as compared to million at june   an increase of million 
operating activities in fiscal used million in funds 
in fiscal  such activities provided million in funds 
this decrease in cash flow from operations resulted primarily from substantial increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
in fiscal  investing activities used  as compared to usage of  in the prior year 
as a result cash and cash equivalents decreased by million to total million at june  as compared to million at june  seasonality and other factors there are certain seasonal factors that may affect the company s business 
traditionally  manufacturing businesses in italy close for the month of august  and the company s customers close for one week in july 
consequently  no shipments or deliveries  as the case may be  of machines distributed by the company that are manufactured in italy are made during these periods which fall in the company s first quarter 
in addition  manufacturing businesses in italy generally close for two weeks in december  during the company s second quarter 
fluctuations of customer orders or other factors may result in quarterly variations in net revenues from year to year 
effects of inflation and changing prices management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations 
a substantial portion of the company s machine and spare part purchases are denominated and payable in italian lira 
currency fluctuations of the lira could result in substantial price level changes and therefore impede or promote import export sales and substantially impact profits 
however  to reduce exposure to adverse foreign currency fluctuations during the period from customer orders to payment for goods sold  the company enters into forward exchange contracts 
the company is not able to assess the quantitative effect that such currency fluctuations could have upon the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not have a significant adverse effect on future operations 
disclosure about foreign currency risk a significant number of the company s purchases of machinery for resale is denominated in italian lira 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements between the italian lira and the us dollar from the time of placing the company s purchase order until final payment for the purchase is made 
the contracts have maturity dates that do not exceed months 
substantially all of the increase or decrease of the lira denominated purchased price is offset by the gains and losses of the foreign exchange contract 
the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the results of operations in the period in which the hedged transaction is consummated 
at june   the company had contracts maturing through april to purchase approximately billion lira for approximately million  which approximates the spot rate on that date
