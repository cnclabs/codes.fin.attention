item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview 
was a year of slow but sustained progress for the company 
during the year  the company substantially completed its objective of consolidating the mining properties in the alder gulch area  both by acquiring additional claims and interests from nonaffiliated parties and by completing the merger of its hanover resources and group s affiliates into the company 
toward the end of the year  the company also was able to renew drilling activities on the properties 
these activities have enhanced the company s knowledge and understanding of the properties  and have contributed to its ongoing geological and metallurgical evaluation 
although management continues to believe the properties lend themselves to large scale development  the company does not as of the date of this report have the cash resources necessary for development nor a development agreement with any major mining company 
the company had hoped to conclude negotiations during the year for the acquisition of significant additional mining claims and interests contiguous to those of the company held by easton pacific  but was unable to do so owing to substantial differences of opinion concerning the value of easton pacific s assets and uncertainty regarding possible environmental liabilities associated with certain of those assets 
as is disclosed elsewhere in this report  however  the company and easton pacific were able to resolve these differences and have entered into an agreement  dated march   pursuant to which the company will acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of easton pacific  whereupon easton pacific will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the transaction with easton pacific is subject to approval by the company s and easton pacific s stockholders  and is expected to close on or about june  the company continued to be supported during the year with equity capital from the investor group formed in and lead by neal a 
degerstrom  an affiliate of the company  and with equity capital derived late in the year from the public sale of  shares of its common stock at the price of per share 
the company intends to issue additional shares of its common stock to the public during in order to meet its ongoing obligations to the landowner lessors of the various mining claims it leases  and to provide working capital for continued exploration of its alder gulch properties 
the number of shares to be issued in such offering and the price at which they will be offered have not been determined as of the date of this report 
the company continues to receive expressions of interest from a number of north american mining companies concerning a joint venture or other economic arrangement to explore and develop the properties  however  and is presently discussing such possibilities with representatives of these companies 
the company previously reported that such an arrangement would be negotiated and concluded during  however the uncertainty within the mining industry resulting from the montana clean water citizens initiative prevented this from happening 
management of the company has now revised its estimate and believes such an arrangement can be negotiated and concluded during this estimate is predicated on the occurrence of certain events during  including continued favorable results from exploration activities conducted on the alder gulch properties  prevailing prices for gold and continued progress in the company s efforts to consolidate additional claims and interests in the area 
results of operations 
compared to during the year ended december   the company realized revenues of approximately  resulting from the sale of carbon product stockpiled at the company s inactive mine 
during the year ended december   the company had revenues of approximately  comprised of  from the sale of refined gold and  from an option payment under the kennecott mining venture 
the company s mining operations were suspended in march due to a lack of funds following kennecott s withdrawal from the mining venture 
milling operations were suspended in april operating expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  
the overall decrease was primarily due to the suspension of mining and milling activities in as a result  there were no costs of goods mined in as compared to  in additionally  in the company wrote down the carrying value of its note receivable due from the related party mill operator by  to reflect the receivable s estimated net realizable value 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a  increase in salaries and payroll costs associated with officers and personnel hired during  professional fees incurred in in connection with the company s acquisition of hanover resources and group s of approximately  and an increase in facility related expenses of approximately  due to the company s establishment of its coeur d alene headquarters 
primarily as a result of the foregoing factors  the company recognized a net loss of  in versus a net loss of  in compared to during the year ended december   the company s revenues increased to  from  for the year ended december  
the increase was due  in part  to the receipt of  from an option payment under the kennecott mining venture in the company s revenues from the sale of refined gold increased to  in from  in primarily as a result of volume increases 
as previously noted  the company suspended its mining and milling activities in march and april  respectively

in  the company wrote down the carrying value of its note receivable due from the related party mill operator by  to reflect the receivable s estimated net realizable value 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in versus  in primarily as a result of increases in officers salaries  printing expense and insurance 
interest income decreased to  in from  in primarily due to lower levels of invested funds 
primarily as a result of the foregoing factors  the company recognized a net loss of  in versus a net loss of  in liquidity and capital resources 
the company has been in the development stage since its inception 
at december   the company had no recurring sources of revenue  had incurred operating losses since its inception and had negative working capital 
additionally  as a consequence of kennecott s withdrawal from the mining venture in march of  the company assumed full responsibility for certain landowner rental and royalty obligations on its alder gulch mining claims 
at december  the rental and royalty obligations payable in totalled  these conditions give rise to substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
accordingly  the company s independent certified public accountants modified their report  dated march   on the company s december  financial statements to include an explanatory paragraph relative to a going concern uncertainty 
management believes the company will meet its obligations using existing funds and funds to be derived from the anticipated sale of additional shares of its common stock 
however  unless the company is able to negotiate a joint venture or other agreement with a major mining company for the continued exploration and development of the alder gulch properties  it may continue to experience a shortage of working capital 
the company has incurred aggregate losses of  from inception through december  because it has not yet been able to place the alder gulch properties into large scale production 
the company s inability to achieve this objective is attributable to a number of factors  including kennecott s unexpected withdrawal from the mining venture and the company s lack of success through in consolidating the various claims and interests in the area 
although the company has been able to conduct exploration and limited development activities on the properties  primarily as the result of its former arrangement with kennecott and  to a lesser extent  as the result of exploration and evaluation work performed by the company during and  significant additional work must be undertaken to determine whether the properties support large scale mining operations 
the company has received expressions of interest from several north american mining companies regarding a joint venture or other economic arrangement to explore and develop the properties  but has not yet concluded such an arrangement 
management of the company now believes such an arrangement can be concluded during as discussed elsewhere in this report  the company restructured its management in late and early  and took a number of significant steps to consolidate the alder gulch mining properties 
in addition  the company has completed a compilation of geologic and other technical data generated from its and kennecott s prior exploration activities 
see the section of this report entitled narrative description of business 
management believes these activities will have a positive effect on the company s performance during  and that the company will be successful in negotiating a joint venture or other arrangement with a major mining company to explore and  if warranted  develop its properties 
at december   the company had a deferred tax asset of approximately  a valuation allowance equal to this amount has been established 
management of the company cannot determine that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits from these deferred tax assets 
although the company s operations are subject to general inflationary pressures  these pressures have not had a significant effect on operations  particularly since early when mining and processing operations were suspended for lack of funds 
if the company resumes exploration and development activities  which can be expected during if it is successful in negotiating a joint venture or other economic arrangement with another mining company  inflation will result in an increase in the cost of goods and services necessary to its mining operations
