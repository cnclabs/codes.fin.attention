item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview theragenics was founded in and is engaged in the manufacture and sale of theraseed r  a rice sized device used for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in a one time  minimally invasive procedure 
in  the company received fda clearance for its principal product  theraseed r  for use in any solid localized tumor 
sales increased in and in due to reliable production from the company s cyclotrons and increased demand for theraseed r as a result of significantly increased marketing efforts and the release of favorable clinical data relating to the use of theraseed r 
theraseed r has been used in an estimated  procedures for prostate cancer since  including approximately  procedures in production of pd  the radioisotope supplying the therapeutic radiation of theraseed r  has always been a controlling factor in the company s efforts to generate sales 
until  the company used a manufacturing process that required it to contract with third parties for enrichment services that were necessary to produce a useable feed material for production of pd in a nuclear reactor 
additionally  the company was dependent on a university and a united states government reactor for the irradiation of this feed material to yield pd these factors combined to limit the availability of pd on a timely and consistent basis 
to increase its control over the timely and consistent availability  quality and cost of pd  the company converted to an alternative means of producing pd using a cyclotron 
in  the company contracted for the purchase of a cyclotron for in house production of pd after the cyclotron was delivered and reliable production of pd was demonstrated  the company discontinued its reliance on outside vendors for enrichment and irradiation services 
in view of the scale of the investment necessary to add cyclotrons and the company s limited access to debt and equity capital  the company undertook a slow and measured roll out of its theraseed r product 
management focused primarily on the careful development of relationships with the physician community and on ensuring that the company s production capabilities could meet demand for its product 
the company added additional cyclotrons in and  and a fourth cyclotron is scheduled to become operational in early because a cyclotron does not become available for production until approximately months after it is ordered  the accuracy of the company s long term plans can significantly affect its results of operations 
the delivery of cyclotrons prior to a commensurate increase in demand could adversely impact margins  while inadequate cyclotron capacity could limit the company s ability to meet demand and achieve maximum sales growth 
the company has recently commenced a million capital expansion project that includes the purchase of four additional cyclotrons and the construction of new production and administrative facilities 
although no assurances can be given  management expects that one new cyclotron will become operational during each quarter of fiscal management intends to apply a substantial portion of the net proceeds from an offering of two million shares of the company s common stock  planned for completion by the end of march  toward the purchase of the cyclotrons to be installed in fiscal and use the remainder for working capital and other corporate purposes as appropriate 
see liquidity and capital resources 
on february   the company entered into a letter of intent with indigo medical  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  stating the intent to grant to indigo the exclusive worldwide right to market and sell theraseed r for the treatment of prostate cancer 
under the terms of the proposed alliance  the company will receive a fixed price per seed sold by indigo in the united states and will participate in any unit price increases above a fixed gross sales price 
indigo would also assume responsibility for the education and training of urologists  radiation oncologists and other personnel involved in the use of theraseed r 
the company will continue to be responsible for all manufacturing and distribution for theraseed r 
the terms of international collaboration would be negotiated in the future 
should a definitive agreement be reached  management expects that the alliance would result in higher sales volume that would offset the reduced price received by the company for its product and would provide avenues for international expansion 
based on the company s ability to utilize indigo s sales  marketing and education and training network  management also anticipates that an alliance with indigo would significantly reduce the increases in selling  general and administrative expense that would be necessary to generate and respond to any future sales increases 
in addition  management expects that increased volume would require the company to purchase additional cyclotrons and plans to order additional cyclotrons at a rate commensurate with demand in the event a definitive agreement with indigo is reached 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company and indigo will successfully negotiate or execute a definitive agreement or that it will have the anticipated effect on the company s results of operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  product sales were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to increased shipments of theraseed r as a result of reliable production from the company s cyclotron based manufacturing process and increased demand for theraseed r as a result of significantly increased marketing efforts and the release of favorable clinical data 
during the periods presented  the company engaged in significant marketing efforts to educate both physicians and patients as to the availability of this treatment option 
sales also reflect that the company had two cyclotrons available to meet sales demand throughout as compared to only one cyclotron until april licensing fees represent royalty payments with respect to the company s licensed therasphere r technology 
management does not expect licensing fees to become material in the foreseeable future

cost of product sales was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due primarily to incremental staffing and cyclotron related costs 
staffing increases were necessary to respond to and anticipate sales growth 
cyclotron operating costs and depreciation increased as the company s second cyclotron ran for the entire year and the third cyclotron was placed in service 
the third cyclotron came on line behind schedule in the fourth quarter of and is experiencing start up difficulties 
as cyclotrons come on line  margins decline because each machine represents excess capacity for a period while carrying its full component of fixed costs  including depreciation 
as a percentage of product sales  cost of product sales decreased from in to in this decrease resulted from economies of scale  offset in part by margin pressures related to bringing the third cyclotron into production 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of  or 
this increase reflects higher expenditures in a number of areas to support increased sales 
marketing expenditures increased  as did staffing costs in response to increasing workloads and responsibilities brought on by growth

additionally  as head count grew  space became limited in the company s two facilities 
the company rented and outfitted off site administrative space at additional expense 
also  an increase in overall asset size resulted in higher insurance and property tax costs 
other support expenses grew in direct response to sales and asset size 
despite these increases  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in due to economies of scale 
during the periods presented  the company had no ongoing pure research function 
development of processes incorporated in the company s production operations is incorporated in the manufacturing area and therefore is included in the cost of goods sold category 
management may choose to develop a research and development program if and when appropriate opportunities are identified and resources are in place

this increase was due to reliable production from the company s cyclotron based manufacturing process and increased demand for theraseed r as a result of significantly increased marketing efforts and the release of favorable clinical data 
during  sales efforts remained conservative while the company addressed the lingering impact of the change over from reactor produced to cyclotron produced pd and a lengthy period of unexpected downtime on the company s first cyclotron during the third quarter of in and the first half of  management delayed increasing marketing efforts until reliable cyclotron production of pd was demonstrated 
once demonstrated  the company instituted a more aggressive marketing program in mid product sales for reflected the favorable impact of this increased marketing effort 
cost of product sales was million in compared to million in  an increase of  or 
this increase resulted from the increase in theraseed r sales 
as a percentage of product sales  cost of product sales decreased from in to in  primarily as a result of increased utilization of production capacity and economies of scale  partially offset by increased depreciation 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of  or 
this increase was due primarily to increased advertising and public relations expense to support activities associated with increased sales 
headcount expenses also increased in response to the additional workload created by the higher sales 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense decreased from in to in due to economies of scale
