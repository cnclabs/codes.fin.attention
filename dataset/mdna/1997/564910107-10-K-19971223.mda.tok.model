see notes to combined financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
the company generates revenues primarily from licensing its software 
when it first licenses its software  the company typically receives both an initial license fee and a periodic license fee 
the periodic license fee  which is typically paid annually in advance thereafter  entitles the customer to continue using the software and to receive certain support services 
if a customer does not renew its periodic license  it is no longer entitled to use the company s software 
the company believes this licensing arrangement provides a source of recurring revenues from its installed base of customers and enables customers to take advantage of new releases and enhancements of its software 
initial license fees are recorded as license revenues and typically recognized upon delivery of the software 
periodic license fees are recorded as services revenues and recognized ratably over the term of the periodic license agreement 
the company s cost structure is designed so that a significant portion of its costs vary in direct relation to license revenues  particularly its selling and marketing expenses and cost of license revenues 
mapics r products are sold primarily through the company s network of independent local affiliates  with support from the company s sales management 
the company s single largest expense is commissions paid to these affiliates  which are based on the revenues they generate from licensing mapics r products 
the company currently expects that as its affiliates generate more license revenues for the company  selling and marketing expenses will decrease as a percentage of total revenues because of the relatively fixed cost of the company s direct selling and marketing activities 
the affiliates  rather than the company  provide the company s customers with consulting and implementation services relating to the mapics r products 
as a result  the company neither generates revenues from providing consulting and implementation services nor bears the fixed costs inherent in maintaining a services business 
in japan and certain eastern european countries  the company utilizes resellers rather than affiliates to distribute the mapics r products  and the company records as license revenue the net royalties received from the resellers without any corresponding commission expenses 
from fiscal to fiscal  net royalties received from such resellers decreased from to of total license revenues of the company 
the company s strategy has been to replace these resellers with affiliates to provide the company with a more direct relationship with its customers 
this shift generally has resulted in an increase in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues and a decrease in the operating margin percentage 
the company believes that the proportion of reseller sales to total license revenues will remain relatively constant for the foreseeable future 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of royalties paid to solution partners with respect to products licensed by the company and amortization of computer software costs 
the company expects that cost of license revenues will vary based on the mix of products licensed during the applicable period between company developed products and solution partner developed products 
the company licenses from its solution partners complementary software products which have been integrated into the mapics r product line 
when the company licenses a solution partner product to a customer  the company pays a royalty to the solution partner 
as a result  a significant portion of its cost of license revenues varies in direct relation to license revenues based on solution partners products 
through its solution partner arrangements  the company has been able to enhance the functionality of its existing products and introduce new products utilizing this variable cost approach to expand its product offerings 
during the past four fiscal years  the mix of products licensed by the company has included increasing percentages of solution partner products  which has resulted in both increasing revenues and royalty costs 
computer software costs include purchased software  in house software development costs and the costs incurred to translate software into various foreign languages 
amortization of purchased software commences when the software is placed in service and is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software  generally five years 
amortization of computer software development and translation costs commences upon general release of the product to customers and is computed on a product by product basis using the greater of the amount determined using a the ratio that current period gross revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues or b the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product  generally five years 
software is subject to rapid technological obsolescence  and as a result  future amortization periods for computer software costs could be shortened to reflect changes in technology in the future 
in fiscal  the company shortened the estimated useful life of its and future computer software translation costs from five years to two years 
this change in estimate decreased net income and pro forma net income per share for the year ended september  by approximately  or 
per share  respectively 
as of september   the company s balance sheet reflected approximately years of accumulated capitalized software development costs because the company did not begin capitalizing software until the acquisition of the exclusive marketing and licensing rights to the mapics r products in february consequently  the company currently expects amortization of these costs to continue to increase through fiscal  when five years of software development costs will have been capitalized 
the company believes that its internal business systems  primarily its computer systems  and its software products will process date information accurately and without interruption when required to process dates in the year and beyond 
the company has not been required to expend significant resources to address the year issue with regard to its internal business systems or its software products 
in fiscal  the company reduced its level of spending on product development activities other than those to translate products into new languages core product development because  at the time  marcam corporation anticipated that the mapics r products would use certain technologies being developed in connection with its protean tm product line 
subsequently  the company determined that such a development strategy was not consistent with the demands of its target market and commenced a revised development strategy which will allow future platform independence 
the company anticipates continuing its efforts to develop  in a java development environment  additional versions of certain of its applications to run on microsoft s nt server platform and on the as the company does not believe that such additional versions will materially affect results of operations or liquidity 
the company currently anticipates that core product development expenditures will increase as a percentage of revenues to levels more consistent with those of fiscal and fiscal because the costs of establishing technological feasibility of computer software products are charged to product development expense as they are incurred  the company s operating results may be affected adversely by significant changes in the level of product development investments 
in the united states and canada  the company provides support services primarily via telephone to its customers 
elsewhere  the company engages local affiliates to provide varying degrees of support services for a fee 
for certain solution partner developed products  the solution partners provide varying levels of support for a fee 
the costs of the company s direct support services and the fees paid to affiliates and solution partners for providing support services are recorded as cost of services revenues 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain line items in the company s combined statements of operations 
fiscal years ended september  revenues license services total revenues operating expenses cost of license revenues cost of services revenues selling and marketing product development general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other interest income interest expense income before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit net income fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal license revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from an increase in license sales to new customers and  to a lesser extent  an increase in license sales to existing customers for new sites  upgraded systems and additional modules  primarily in north america 
services revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  principally due to the increase in the company s installed customer base 
cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these costs increased as a percentage of license revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal 
these increases were primarily due to i increased royalty costs as the volume of solution partner products licensed by the company increased in fiscal  ii increased amortization of capitalized software development costs which resulted from the increased capitalized software asset  and iii increased amortization of capitalized software translation costs resulting from a change in estimate of useful life which increased amortization expense by approximately  in fiscal the company believes the trend of increasing costs of license revenues will continue in fiscal cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues consists primarily of personnel costs related to the ongoing maintenance and support of the mapics r products  fees paid to affiliates outside the united states and canada to provide certain support services in those regions and the fees paid to solution partners to provide similar services with respect to their products 
cost of services revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of the increased fees paid to affiliates and solution partners for providing support services 
as a percentage of services revenues  these costs increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from increased fees paid to solution partners and affiliates for support services in fiscal selling and marketing 
selling and marketing  expenses consist primarily of commissions paid to the company s independent affiliates  compensation for the company s sales and marketing personnel and direct costs associated with the company s marketing campaigns 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to increased commissions earned by affiliates on increased license revenues 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling and marketing expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from the company s direct selling and marketing costs being relatively fixed in nature 
product development 
product development expenses consist primarily of compensation for software engineering personnel and independent contractors retained to assist with the company s product development efforts 
the company charges all costs of establishing technological feasibility of computer software products to product development expense as they are incurred 
from the time of establishing technological feasibility through general release of the product  computer software development and translation costs are capitalized and thereafter amortized to cost of license revenues 
overall  product development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of total revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal these increases resulted primarily from an increase in core development spending and a decrease in the percentage of costs qualifying for capitalization in fiscal see overview and item business product development 
gross core development expenditures increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased development expenditures as a result of the company s change in product development strategy 
see overview and item business product development 
the amounts of core development expenditures capitalized in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively  representing and of gross core development expenditures during those periods  respectively 
the amount of development expenditures capitalized in fiscal decreased because a higher proportion of development expenditures was related to the establishment of technological feasibility of the products under the company s revised development strategy 
gross translation expenditures decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal translation expenditures are typically project related  and the timing of these expenditures is subject to change from period to period 
the amounts of translation expenditures capitalized in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively  representing and  respectively  of gross translation expenditures during those periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for executive  financial  legal and administrative personnel  outside professional and service fees and provisions for bad debts 
general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from million in fiscal  due primarily to increases in facilities and personnel costs in the europe  middle east and africa region emea 
general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal income tax expense benefit 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of million during fiscal compared to income tax expense of million during fiscal historically  the operations represented by mapics have been included in the consolidated united states federal and certain state and foreign income tax returns filed by marcam corporation 
for financial reporting purposes  income tax expense has been reflected on a separate return basis for all periods presented in the combined financial statements through the distribution 
pursuant to a tax sharing agreement between marcam corporation and marcam solutions see note of notes to combined financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data  the company became entitled to utilize certain favorable tax attributes principally net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits of marcam corporation immediately following the distribution 
as a result  the company recognized an income tax benefit of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal see liquidity and capital resources 
prior to the distribution  marcam corporation did not reflect a benefit corresponding to these favorable tax attributes in its consolidated financial statements because marcam corporation s management believed it was more likely than not such benefits would not be realized due to marcam corporation s history of operating losses 
the income tax benefit of million for fiscal reflects income tax expense of million offset by the income tax benefit of million 
excluding the income tax benefit  the effective tax rate in fiscal was which differs from the statutory federal rate of principally due to the impact of state income taxes 
the effective tax rate of in fiscal differs from the statutory federal rate of principally due to the impact of state income taxes 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal license revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from an increase of license sales to new and existing customers for new sites  upgraded systems and additional modules  particularly outside the united states and canada 
this increase was primarily attributable to the availability of french  german  spanish and portuguese translations of release of mapics r xa 
services revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  principally due to the increase in the company s installed customer base and revenues from optional support services offered in emea to customers who had licensed mapics r products from ibm without support services 
cost of license revenues

liquidity and capital resources mapics has funded its operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash generated from operations 
historically  mapics has remitted its excess cash from operations to marcam corporation 
during fiscal  and  mapics transferred net cash to marcam corporation of million  million and million  respectively 
as of september   the company had million in cash and a working capital deficit of million 
excluding million of deferred revenues  which are included in current liabilities  the company had working capital of million as of september  cash provided by operations was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  working capital changes included a million increase in deferred revenues as a result of growth in services revenues  the deferral of license revenue related to a significant fourth quarter license agreement and an million increase in accrued expenses due to increased affiliate commissions  product royalties and employee bonuses payable 
those increases were offset partially by a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
during fiscal  working capital was principally affected by an increase in deferred revenues as a result of growth in services revenues 
cash used for investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company used cash for investing activities related to computer software development and translation and purchases of computer software and property and equipment 
cash used for financing activities includes net cash transferred to marcam corporation  as discussed above  during fiscal  and additionally  during fiscal  the company had several significant financing activities which were directly or indirectly related to the distribution  as discussed in the following paragraphs 
on july   the company borrowed million the debt financing from a bank to finance the million cash transfer to marcam solutions and to repay marcam corporation s million subordinated notes due the subordinated notes 
the indebtedness incurred in the debt financing had an interest rate of 
in connection with the debt financing  marcam corporation s million revolving credit facility was terminated 
in august  the company executed a senior secured term loan and revolving credit facility to repay a portion of the borrowings from the debt financing and for general corporate purposes 
substantially all of the company s assets are pledged as collateral for obligations under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains covenants which  among other things  require the company to maintain certain financial ratios and impose certain limitations or prohibitions on the company with respect to the occurrence of indebtedness  liens and capital leases  the payment of dividends on and the redemption or repurchase of capital stock of the company  investments and acquisitions  the merger or consolidation of the company with any person or entity  and the disposition of any of the company s properties or assets 
during august  the company completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of its common stock the offering raising net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting offering costs of approximately million 
the net proceeds of the offering along with borrowings of million under the term loan credit facility described above and working capital of million were used to repay the million of indebtedness from the debt financing 
as of september   the company repaid the principal of the term loan and interest thereon of  upon repayment of the borrowings outstanding under the term loan  no additional amounts are available for future borrowings under the term loan facility 
additional borrowings of up to million  subject to certain limitations  are available to the company under the revolving credit facility 
availability of revolving credit loans and the rate of interest thereof vary depending upon the company s ability to maintain certain financial ratios 
outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility mature on june  no amount was outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of september  the company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee for unused portions of the revolving credit facility 
pursuant to a tax sharing agreement between marcam corporation and marcam solutions  mapics became entitled to utilize certain favorable income tax attributes principally net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits of marcam corporation immediately following the distribution 
the company believes that the utilization of these favorable income tax attributes will result in cash savings from the reduction of income taxes payable in future periods as these favorable income tax attributes are utilized 
at september   the company had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards  and approximately million of research and experimentation and other credit carryforwards 
such carryforwards expire between and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards will be limited on an annual basis due to a change in ownership of marcam corporation during fiscal the company does not believe that this limitation will have a significant impact on its ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
pursuant to the same tax sharing agreement  marcam solutions is generally responsible for certain state  local and foreign taxes for periods ended on or before the distribution  and the company is responsible for all other taxes for such periods 
in addition  the company is generally liable for any taxes arising out of the distribution 
income taxes arising out of the distribution  principally foreign income taxes  currently expected to approximate million  were provided for in the fourth quarter of fiscal see notes and of notes to combined financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
as of september   the company did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
on december   the company s board of directors authorized a plan  subject to certain limitations  to repurchase up to million shares of common stock from time to time in the open market or directly from shareholders at prevailing market prices that management deems appropriate 
in connection with effecting the plan  the covenant under the credit facility which restricted the repurchase of mapics capital stock was amended to permit the company to repurchase shares of its capital stock  subject to certain limitations 
the company believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditure needs at least until the end of fiscal inflation to date  the company believes inflation has not had a material impact on the company s operations 
new accounting standards during fiscal  the company adopted the disclosure only alternative of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which requires the company to elect either expense recognition under sfas no 
or its disclosure only alternative for stock based employee compensation 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  and the company has disclosed the pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share using the fair value based method of sfas no 
for fiscal and fiscal  in note of notes to combined financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 earnings per share  which is effective for periods ending after december  sfas no 
will require the company to present basic and diluted earnings per share eps 
basic eps  which replaces primary eps  excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity 
diluted eps is computed similarly to fully diluted eps under existing rules 
sfas no 
requires restatement of all prior period earnings per share data presented 
the company adopted sfas no 
as of october   however  had the company adopted sfas no 
in fiscal  basic pro forma eps would have been and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and diluted pro forma eps would have been and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosure of information about capital structure  which is effective for periods ending after december  sfas no 
establishes standards for disclosing information about an entity s capital structure 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which is effective for periods beginning after december  sfas no 
requires businesses to disclose comprehensive income and its components in their general purpose financial statements  with reclassification of comparative earlier period financial statements 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which is effective for periods beginning after december  sfas no 
redefines how operating segments are determined and requires disclosure of certain financial and descriptive information about a company s operating segments 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s disclosures 
in october  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop software revenue recognition 
sop provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions and supersedes sop sop is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sop is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or disclosures 
factors affecting future performance variability in quarterly operating results  seasonality 
the company has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and anticipates that such fluctuations will continue and may intensify 
the company s quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors that could materially and adversely affect revenues and profitability  including the size and timing of license transactions  the demand for the company s products  the proportion of revenues attributable to license fees versus services fees  the proportion of solution partner developed products versus internally developed products licensed  changes in the level of operating expenses  the potential for delay or deferral of customer purchases of the company s software  the timing of the introduction or market acceptance of new or enhanced products offered by the company or its competitors  the ability of the company s affiliate distribution channel to service additional sales  the competitive conditions in the industry  and the general economic and political conditions and other factors affecting capital expenditures by customers 
the purchase of the company s products and services may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources by its customers with the attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures and authorization procedures within an organization 
accordingly  the sales cycles for the company s products and services are subject to a number of significant risks over which the company has little or no control  including customers budgetary constraints and internal authorization procedures 
license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
the company s quarterly operating results are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations 
the company believes that its first quarter ending december revenues generally are positively affected by calendar year end capital expenditures by certain customers and by calendar year end incentives provided by ibm to resellers of its hardware  which include many of the company s distribution affiliates 
in the company s fourth quarter ending september  revenues are positively affected by the incentives provided pursuant to the company s sales compensation plans 
these factors have historically resulted in increased license revenues during such quarters 
in addition  the company s revenues occur predominantly in the third month of each quarter and tend to be concentrated in the latter half of that third month 
accordingly  the company s quarterly operating results are difficult to predict  and delays in product delivery or in closings of sales near the end of a quarter could cause quarterly revenues and  to a greater degree  net income to fall substantially short of anticipated levels 
net income is affected because the company establishes its spending levels on the basis of its expected future operating margins 
these seasonal factors are likely to continue to affect quarter to quarter comparisons 
due to the foregoing factors  it is possible that the company s operating results could fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in such event  or in the event that adverse conditions in the manufacturing or erp marketplace prevail or are perceived to prevail  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
reliance on third party distribution channel 
the company markets  sells and supports its products primarily through a network of more than distribution affiliates and as a result maintains a limited direct sales force 
the company relies on its affiliates for sales  product implementation  customization and customer support services 
there can be no assurance that the affiliates will continue to provide the level and quality of service required to meet the needs of the company s customers or that the company will be able to maintain effective long term relationships with its affiliates 
if the company is unable to maintain effective  long term relationships with the affiliates  or if the affiliates fail to meet the needs of the company s customers  the company s business would be adversely affected 
from time to time certain of the company s competitors have established  and may continue to seek to establish  a comparable distribution channel  in part by attempting to attract the company s own affiliates 
the company s agreements with its affiliates are generally terminable by either party and do not impose specific obligations on the part of the affiliates 
further  there can be no assurance that the affiliates will not otherwise reduce or discontinue their relationships with or support of the company and its products

competition 
the market for business software within the mid size manufacturing industry is highly competitive  changes rapidly and is to a significant degree affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
the company s products and related services are primarily targeted at the market for business applications software for use with the ibm as the company s current and prospective competitors offer a variety of products which address this and similar markets 
the company s primary competition comes from a large number of independent software vendors and other sources including baan nv  computer associates  inc  intentia ab  jba holdings plc  jd edwards company  inc  oracle corporation  sap ag  and system software associates  inc of the company s primary competitors  the products of intentia are currently designed solely for use with the ibm as  and the products of jba holdings plc  jd edwards and system software associates are currently designed for use primarily with the ibm as the company also experiences some competition from vendors of specialized applications 
certain of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  service  support and technical resources and greater name recognition than the company 
to be successful in the future  the company must continue to respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of technological change and its competitors innovations 
the company s competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than the company 
the company also expects to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the market for business software for use with the as and as new products and technologies are introduced 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make acquisitions or establish alliances among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of the company s prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share  resulting in price or fee rate reductions  fewer customer orders and reduced gross margin  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  because the company relies on a network of distribution affiliates for implementation and other support of its products  there can be no assurance that these affiliates will maintain sufficiently high quality standards so that the company s reputation and competitive position will not be adversely affected 
see item business marketing and sales and competition 
dependence on key personnel  ability to attract and retain skilled personnel 
the company s future performance depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of a number of senior management and key technical personnel 
the company does not maintain key person life insurance on any of its key employees 
none of the company s employees is bound by an employment agreement 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s future financial results also will depend in large part upon its ability to attract on a timely basis and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel and the ability of its officers and key employees to manage growth successfully and to continue successful development of new products and enhancements to existing products 
competition for such personnel is intense and is likely to intensify further as companies compete to hire personnel  particularly to address year issues 
the company competes in the market for such personnel against numerous companies  including larger  more established companies with significantly greater financial resources than the company 
the company has at times experienced and continues to experience difficulty recruiting qualified personnel  and there can be no assurance that the company will not continue to experience such difficulties in the future 
if the company is unable to hire and retain qualified personnel in the future  such inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

new products and technological change 
the market for the company s erp software products is characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to continue to enhance its mapics r products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
in particular  the company must continue to anticipate and respond adequately to advances in standard business applications software and client server solutions  as well as object oriented technology 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  functioning product enhancements or new products that respond to technological advances by its competitors or that its new products will achieve market acceptance 
see item business product development 
as a result of the complexities inherent in the functionality and performance demanded by erp software customers  major new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
in addition  erp software programs as complex as those offered by the company may contain errors which are discovered only after the products and new releases have been installed and used by customers despite testing by the company 
there can be no assurance that undetected errors will not impair the market acceptance of these products or adversely affect the company s operating results 
problems encountered by customers installing and implementing the company s new product releases or with product performance  including product functionality  product response time and programs errors  could also materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
dependence on external development resources 
several of the company s application modules were developed in collaboration with third party solution partners  and the company expects to continue to rely on solution partners for the development of additional application modules 
generally  solution partners continue to own the rights to  and maintain  the technology underlying the modules and license  on an exclusive basis  the technology to the company 
under the terms of such agreements  the company is obligated to pay a royalty to a solution partner for sales of the solution partner developed application modules 
in the event the company fails to pay the required royalty when due  such agreement may be terminated 
the termination of such an agreement with a solution partner could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that solution partners will be available to develop application modules for the company in the future or will complete application modules for the company on a timely basis  within acceptable guidelines  or at all 
the company s success depends in part on its continued ability to license application modules from solution partners  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such licenses on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
although the company is entitled to obtain a non exclusive license to the source code for an application module in the event the solution partner fails to maintain or update the application module  goes out of business or otherwise breaches the terms of the license agreement  the company may not be able to maintain or upgrade the application module adequately or on a timely basis 
the failure of the company to adequately or on a timely basis maintain or upgrade the application module could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business product development 
dependence on ibm s as substantially all of the company s revenues have been derived from products designed to operate primarily on ibm s as series of computers 
therefore  the company s future revenues from initial license fees and periodic license fees will be primarily derived from and dependent upon the continued widespread use of the as and the continued support of the as by ibm 
while the company believes that customers will continue to use  and ibm will continue to support  the as  there can be no assurance of such continued use or support  and the loss of either would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company will be required and intends to continue to devote significant resources to supporting its installed base of as customers 
although the company believes it has an advantage in assisting its installed as base in converting to independent platforms  there is no assurance that these customers will continue to use mapics r products if they implement such independent platforms 
if there should be a rapid shift away from the current widespread use of the as operating system  the company would be required to expend substantial capital resources to develop new software and would be likely to experience delays or losses in customer orders  as a result  its business would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  to retain its as customers  the company may be required to adapt its mapics r products to any changes made in the as operating system in the future 
the company s inability to adapt to future changes in the as operating system  or delays in doing so  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

limited history as a stand alone public company  limited relevance of certain historical financial information 
the company has operated as a stand alone company only since the distribution on july  except for richard c 
cook  the company s senior executive officers have had limited or no prior management experience as senior executives in a public company 
while the company continues to receive certain services from marcam solutions following the distribution  there can be no assurance that the company s operating results will not be adversely affected as a result of the reduction of general service assistance from marcam solutions 
in anticipation of being established as a stand alone entity  the company reviewed its business and operations and implemented certain organizational changes 
however  there can be no assurance that these changes or that the separation from marcam solutions will not have an adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the financial information included herein may not necessarily reflect the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company in the future or what the results of operations  financial position and cash flows would have been had mapics been a separate  stand alone entity during the periods presented  because certain allocations were made in preparing such financial data 
this is particularly true with regard to allocations of corporate overhead 
the financial information included herein does not reflect the many significant changes that have occurred in the funding and operations of the company as a result of the distribution and the offering 
in addition  the combined financial statements of the company include certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses which were not historically recorded at the entity level of  but are associated with  the company

management of potential growth 
the company s business has grown rapidly in the last four years  with total revenues increasing to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this recent growth has placed  and may continue to place  strain on the company s management and systems 
accordingly  the company s future operating results will depend  in part  on the ability of its officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve its operational and financial control systems and to effectively expand  train and manage its employee base 
the company s growth is also dependent upon its distribution affiliates ability to implement the company s products in response to the projected demands of the company s customer base 
there can be no assurance that the company or its affiliates will be able to manage any future expansion successfully  and any inability to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
relationship with marcam solutions 
the company has entered into certain agreements with marcam solutions which govern certain aspects of the parties relationship on an ongoing basis that may be material to the conduct of the company s business  including the provision of certain administrative services and indemnification obligations related to the distribution 
these agreements would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations if such agreements result in significant liabilities to the company 
further  because prior to the distribution the business currently conducted by marcam solutions was conducted through marcam corporation  mapics may be liable for the liabilities of marcam solutions if marcam solutions for any reason is unable to satisfy such liabilities 
see note of notes to combined financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
dependence on worldwide manufacturing industry 
the company s business depends substantially upon the capital expenditures of mid size manufacturers  which expenditures depend in part upon the demand for such manufacturers products 
a recession or other adverse events affecting the worldwide manufacturing industry served by the company could affect such demand  forcing manufacturers in the company s target market to curtail or postpone capital expenditures on business information systems 
any such change in the amount or timing of capital expenditures in its target market could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertain protection of proprietary technology 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon protection of its proprietary software 
the company relies on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and license and non disclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products 
the company enters into confidentiality and or license agreements with its employees  distributors  customers and potential customers and limits access to and distribution of its software  documentation and other proprietary information 
there can be no assurance  however  that despite these precautions  an unauthorized third party will not copy or reverse engineer certain portions of the company s products or obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the mechanisms used by the company to protect its software will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop software products that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s software products 
in the future  the company may receive notices claiming that it is infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties  and there can be no assurance that the company will not become the subject of infringement claims or legal proceedings by third parties with respect to current or future products 
in addition  the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of the company s proprietary rights or to establish the validity of the company s proprietary rights 
any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or force the company to enter into royalty or license agreements rather than dispute the merits of such claims 
moreover  an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require the expenditure of significant resources to develop non infringing technology  require disputed rights to be licensed from others or require the company to cease the marketing or use of certain products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent the company desires or is required to obtain licenses to proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that any such licenses will be made available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
claims against the company  with or without merit  as well as claims initiated by the company against third parties  can be time consuming and expensive to defend  prosecute or resolve

risks of product liability 
the company s products are generally used to manage data critical to large organizations 
as a result  the sale and support of products by the company may entail the risk of product liability claims 
while the company s license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that such limitations of liability provisions may not be effective under the laws of all jurisdictions 
in addition  the company is insured for product liability protection against claims for personal injury or damage to property  as well as for the customers losses for which the company is liable  although such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all claims in the event the limitation of liability provisions contained in the company s license agreements are not effective 
although the company has not experienced any significant product liability claims to date  there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to such claims in the future 
a successful product liability claim brought against the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  defending such a suit  regardless of its merits  could entail substantial expense and require the time and attention of key management personnel  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with international operations and currency fluctuations 
a material portion of the company s business comes from outside the united states  and the company believes that its continued growth and profitability will require expansion of its sales in international markets 
to successfully expand international sales  the company has utilized  and will continue to utilize  substantial resources to enlarge existing foreign operations  establish additional foreign operations and hire additional personnel 
international expansion of the company s operations has required  and will continue to require  the company to translate and localize its application modules 
to the extent the company is unable to expand its international operations or translate and localize its application modules in a timely manner  it is likely to adversely impact the company s operating results 
in addition  even if international operations are successfully expanded  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market presence or demand for its products 
risks inherent in the company s international business activities include imposition of government controls  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  trade restrictions  difficulties in staffing international offices  difficulty in collecting or inability to collect license fees and longer accounts receivable payment collection cycles in certain countries  burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  management of an organization spread over various countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and overlap of different tax structures 
in addition  effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products 
as a result of the continued expansion of the company s international operations  the fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies in which the company conducts its business may cause currency transaction gains and losses 
to date  currency transaction gains and losses have not been material 
however  due to the number of foreign currencies involved  the constantly changing currency exposures and volatility of currency exchange rates  the company cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these factors 
anti takeover provisions  rights plan  issuance of preferred stock 
the company s restated articles of organization and amended and restated by laws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discourage acquisition bids for  or discourage changes in management of  the company 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock 
also  the company has adopted a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which the company has distributed to its stockholders rights to purchase shares of junior participating preferred stock the rights plan 
upon certain triggering events  such rights become exercisable to purchase the company s common stock at a price substantially discounted from the then applicable market price of the company s common stock 
the rights plan could generally discourage a merger or tender offer involving the securities of the company that is not approved by the company s board of directors by increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and  accordingly  could have an adverse impact on stockholders who might want to vote in favor of such merger or participate in such tender offer 
in addition  shares of the company s preferred stock have been issued in the past and may be issued in the future without further stockholder approval and upon such terms and conditions  and having such rights  privileges and preferences  as the board of directors may determine 
the rights of the holders of common stock are subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of preferred stock currently outstanding and will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of any holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company 
the company has no present plans to issue any additional shares of preferred stock 
the company s board of directors is divided into three classes  each of which serves for a staggered three year term 
such staggered board may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of the company s board of directors 
the amended and restated by laws impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
shares eligible for future sale  registration rights 
sales of substantial numbers of shares of common stock  or the prospect of such sales  could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and the company s ability to raise needed capital in the capital markets at a time and price favorable to the company 
as of december   the company had a total of  shares of common stock outstanding  a substantial majority of which are freely tradeable without restriction under the securities act of  as amended the securities act 
of these outstanding shares   shares are subject to lock up agreements with the representatives of the underwriters of the offering which expire on january  the lock up agreements 
such agreements provide that the representatives may  in their sole discretion and at any time without notice  release all or a portion of the shares subject to these lock up agreements 
as of december   the company had options to purchase an aggregate of  shares outstanding under its existing stock option plans and had an additional  shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to these plans 
any shares of common stock issued upon the exercise of such outstanding options or any options granted in the future will be  upon issuance  freely tradeable in the public market  except for shares subject to lock up agreements and shares held by affiliates of the company 
of the outstanding options   shares issuable upon exercise of such options are exercisable on or before january   and of these shares of common stock   shares are subject to lock up agreements 
the company also has in effect a registration statement under the securities act covering the sale of  shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants exercisable at a price of per share 
these shares of common stock are not subject to lock up agreements 
the holders of the company s convertible preferred stock currently convertible into  shares of common stock and the holders of warrants currently exercisable for  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share are entitled to certain demand registration rights with respect to such shares of common stock commencing on or after july  and are also entitled to piggy back registration rights 
if the company were required to include in a company initiated registration shares held by such holders pursuant to the exercise of their piggyback registration rights  such sale might have an adverse effect on the company s ability to raise needed capital in the capital markets at a time and price favorable to the company 
in addition   shares of common stock underlying the convertible preferred stock and warrants currently are eligible for sale in the public market subject to the conditions of securities and exchange commission rule  and the remaining  shares of common stock underlying the convertible preferred stock and warrants become eligible for sale subject to the conditions of rule on july  of the  shares underlying the convertible preferred stock and warrants   are subject to lock up agreements
