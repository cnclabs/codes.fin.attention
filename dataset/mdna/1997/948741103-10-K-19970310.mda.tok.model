cash flow from operating activities as reported in the statements of consolidated cash flows increased to million for from million for and million for cash dividends increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the company satisfied its reit requirement of distributing at least of ordinary taxable income for each of the three years ended december   and  accordingly  federal income taxes were not provided in these years 
the company s dividend payout ratio for  and approximated  and  respectively  based on funds from operations for that year 
the company continued to expand its portfolio of income producing properties in this growth resulted primarily from acquisitions of existing properties  both shopping centers and industrial properties

million square foot build to suit industrial project on a tract of the company s undeveloped land and also completed development of three shopping centers which added

additionally  the company has an ongoing program for maintaining and renovating its existing portfolio of properties 
capitalized expenditures for acquisitions  new development and additions to the existing portfolio were  in millions   and during  and  respectively 
all of the acquisitions and new development during were initially financed under the company s revolving credit facility 
total debt outstanding increased to million at december   from million at december  the company increased total debt by million primarily to fund acquisitions and new development 
the company s ratio of debt to total market capitalization was at december   as compared to at year end during the year  the company issued an additional million in unsecured medium term notes mtns 
these mtns were issued with an average life of years at an average interest rate of and the proceeds were used to pay down balances outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility 
continued growth through acquisitions and new development will eventually necessitate the issuance of additional equity securities  however  the company s current capital structure should allow the issuance of additional debt before this is required 
in the interim  the company will continue to closely monitor both the debt and equity markets and carefully consider its available alternatives  including both public and private placements

at december   amounts available under the shelf registration totaled million 
the company expects to continue to issue debt under its shelf registration and to continually seek and evaluate other sources of capital 
funds from operations the company considers funds from operations to be an alternate measure of the performance of an equity reit since such measure does not recognize depreciation and amortization of real estate assets as operating expenses 
management believes that reductions for these charges are not meaningful in evaluating income producing real estate  which historically has not depreciated 
the national association of real estate investment trusts defines funds from operations as net income plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  less gains and losses on sales of properties 
funds from operations does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations increased to million in  as compared to million in and million in these increases relate primarily to the impact of the company s acquisitions and new developments and  to a lesser degree  the activity at its existing properties 
for further information on changes between years  see results of operations below 
results of operations rental revenues increased or million from million in to million in and by or million from million in these increases are primarily the result of the company s acquisition and new development programs 
occupancy of the company s shopping centers and total portfolio increased from at december  to at the end of the company s industrial portfolio remained constant at 
the increase in occupancy from  in addition to increased rental rates obtained from the re leasing and renewal of existing space  accounted for the remaining increase in rental revenues 
the company completed renewals or leases comprising million square feet at an average rental rate increase of 
net of capital costs for tenant improvements  the increase averaged interest income totaled million in  million in and million in this decrease in income is primarily the result of the company selling million of its investment in marketable debt securities during the fourth quarter of the sale resulted in a gain of 
million 
equity in earnings of real estate joint ventures and partnerships totaled million in  million in and million in the decrease in is due to the sale in the third quarter of of the company s interest in an apartment complex accounted for under the equity method 
this sale resulted in a gain of million 
the increase in is due to improvements in the operating results from the properties held in the joint ventures and partnerships 
direct costs and expenses of operating the company s properties ie  operating and ad valorem tax expenses increased to million in from million in and million in these increases are primarily due to property acquired and developed during these periods 
overall  direct operating costs and expenses as a percentage of rental revenues have continually declined from in to in and to in depreciation and amortization have increased to million in from million in and million in  also as a result of the properties acquired and developed during these periods 
gross interest costs  before capitalization of interest to development projects  increased by million from million in to million in this increase in interest cost was due mainly to the increase in the average debt outstanding from million for to million for the weighted average interest rate decreased slightly from in to in interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  increased million from due to the decrease in interest capitalization from million in to million in as a result of the completion in of two of the company s significant development projects 
comparing to  gross interest costs increased from million in to million in this was due to an increase in the average debt outstanding from million in to million in and to an increase in the weighted average interest rate between the two periods from in to in interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  increased by only million due to the increase in interest capitalization as a result of increased development activity during the gain on sales of property and securities of million in is due primarily to the sale of two properties and the receipt of insurance proceeds from fires which destroyed parts of two shopping centers during there were no such occurrences in or as a result of the changes described above  net income increased to million in from million in and by from million in net income per common share increased to in from in and in effects of inflation the rate of inflation was relatively unchanged in the company has structured its leases  however  in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby the company receives rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which allows the company to adjust rentals to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and ad valorem taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as ad valorem tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon the company s operating results 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes certain forward looking statements reflecting the company s expectations in the near term  however  many factors which may affect the actual results  especially the everchanging retail environment  are difficult to predict 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the company s expectations will be realized
