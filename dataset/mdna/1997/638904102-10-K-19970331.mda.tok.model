see business general included herein for a description of the company 
the company s revenue is primarily comprised of premiums  commissions and investment income 
navigators derives substantially all of its business from direct participation in  or by reinsuring certain members of  insurance pools managed by the somerset companies 
the insurance business and operations of navigators are managed by nmc  one of the somerset companies 
the somerset companies specialize principally in the following lines of business marine  aviation and property primarily inland marine insurance and certain lines of specialty reinsurance and non marine insurance 
in  navigators began to underwrite onshore energy business primarily covering property damage and machinery breakdown 
in  the somerset companies underwrote the marine business through a syndicate of insurance companies  navigators having the largest participation in the syndicate 
the somerset companies derive their revenue from commissions  investment income  service fees and cost reimbursement arrangements from navigators and other insurers 
commissions are earned both on a fixed percentage of premiums and on underwriting profits on business placed with the participating insurance companies within the syndicate 
property and casualty insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and  accordingly  during a hard market demand for property and casualty insurance exceeds supply  or capacity  and as a result  premiums and commissions may increase 
on the downturn of the property and casualty cycle  supply exceeds demand  and as a result  premiums and commissions may decrease 
navigators and the somerset companies earn investment income on cash balances and invested assets 
the somerset companies also earn investment income on fiduciary funds 
such fiduciary funds are invested  subject to applicable insurance regulations  primarily in short term instruments 
results of operations general the results of operations of the company were dominated by the northridge  california earthquake  which occurred on january  the northridge earthquake 
the company s pre tax loss including direct property losses of  reinsurance reinstatement premiums of  and reinsurance assumed losses of  but net of reinsurance in from the northridge earthquake totalled  as a result of this loss  management restructured the company by withdrawing from the large commercial and industrial property business which produced most of the earthquake loss  emphasizing its core ocean marine and aviation business  and developing its inland marine business as well as a new non marine program book of business 
the results of and reflect this restructuring in that written premiums have been reduced while the continuing book of business has produced profits 
however  the results also reflect the further development of losses from the northridge earthquake 
during the total reported gross losses on direct property claims arising from the northridge earthquake increased approximately  from  to  the company also added gross bulk reserves of  at september   which are expected to cover any further deterioration of losses from the northridge earthquake 
on a net basis  the incurred losses relating to the northridge earthquake represented pre tax charges of approximately  in there was no further development of the losses from the northridge earthquake in  however  there can be no assurance given that additional losses will not be reported or adjustments made to existing reserves 
revenues gross written premium decreased from million in to million in to million in the following table sets forth the company s gross written premium by line of business and net written premium in the aggregate for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands marine    aviation    property and inland marine    onshore energy  specialty reinsurance and non marine program insurance    total gross written premium    ceded written premium    total net written premium    marine premiums 
navigators gross marine premium decreased from to and from to the decrease was due to navigators reduced participation in the marine pool along with premium rate decreases 
the decrease was due primarily to decreases in premium rates 
the competition causing premium rates to decrease affects the gross written premium in that less premium is received for the policies written or the company may decide to not write the policy 
management believes pricing in marine premium is subject to increased competition 
aviation premiums 
navigators aviation gross written premium increased from to reflecting the increase in navigators participation in the aviation pool from approximately for the first nine months of to beginning october  the reduction in navigators aviation gross written premium from to was due to navigators withdrawing from the general aviation business in order to concentrate on the major airlines and manufacturers  to price competition and to a general decrease in the amount of exposure per risk 
property and inland marine premium 
navigators gross property and inland marine premium decreased from to in  this business consisted primarily of large commercial and industrial property risks  which was essentially a property catastrophe book of business  with a relatively small amount of inland marine risks 
in late  navigators decided to cease writing large commercial and industrial property risks and to concentrate on inland marine risks and  therefore  gross written premium is primarily inland marine 
the increase in this line of business from to reflects the emphasis placed on inland marine in however  due to heavy price competition and possible adverse selection in competing with the major carriers  less emphasis will be placed on inland marine going forward 
onshore energy 
in  navigators began to underwrite onshore energy business which principally focuses on the oil and gas  chemical and petrochemical  and power generation industries with coverages primarily for property damage and machinery breakdown 
specialty reinsurance and non marine insurance premium 
during the early part of  navigators management decided to discontinue writing assumed reinsurance  with the exception of a few specialty contracts 
the reduction in reinsurance premium was partially offset in by an expansion of the specialty program business 
net written premium 
navigators net written premium decreased from to primarily due to the decrease in the property premium 
the increase in net written premium from to was primarily due to navigators increasing its participation in the aviation pool to at october  and to less premium being ceded 
the decreases in the ceded premium are reflective of decreases in the gross written premium but are also due to price competition in the reinsurance business 
net earned premium 
the decrease in net earned premium from to was due to the decrease in the net written premium partially offset by the run off of the property business cancelled in and the decrease in net earned premium from to was primarily due to the decrease in the net written premium and the effect that the property business run off had on the net earned premium 
commission income 
commission income decreased to million in from million in primarily due to navigators increasing its participation to at october  in the aviation business managed by the somerset companies  which eliminated commission income paid by the former participants in the aviation insurance pool 
the commission income includes  of profit commissions earned under the company s management agreement with riverside 
commission income decreased to million in from million in reflecting the withdrawal from the property catastrophe business 
the commission income is also affected by profit commissions from the marine pool 
net investment income 
net investment income decreased to million in from million in due to decreased fiduciary funds held by the somerset companies  the effect on invested assets from payments of earthquake losses and generally lower yields 
net investment income increased to million in from million in due primarily to an increased amount of invested assets 
reinsurance ceded 
in the ordinary course of business  navigators reinsures certain insurance risks with unaffiliated insurance companies for the purpose of limiting its maximum loss exposure  protecting against catastrophic losses  and maintaining desired ratios of net premiums written to statutory surplus 
ceded written premium decreased from million in to million in to million in reflecting decreases in gross written premium and lower prices in the reinsurance market 
expenses 
the ratio of loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred to net earned premium was  and in  and  respectively 
the loss ratio was adversely impacted by the northridge earthquake 
the loss ratio improved in compared to  even though included significant adverse development from the northridge earthquake losses 
this was due primarily to a return to more normal experience in comparison to the losses from the northridge earthquake  various airline losses and reinsurance costs in the northridge earthquake increased the loss ratio by and in and  respectively 
the improved loss ratio in compared to was due primarily to a return to more normal experience 
the lower rates in the marine business was partially offset by lower costs for reinsurance 
commission expense as a percentage of net earned premium was  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to was due primarily to a reduction in the amount of northridge earthquake reinstatement premiums incurred during the year 
the reinstatement premiums in caused earned premiums to decline but did not result in corresponding ceding commissions 
the increase in the commission expense ratio compared to was primarily due to the reversal of approximately  of contingent commissions receivable recorded in on certain ceded contracts which had loss development during other operating expenses as a percentage of net earned premium were  and for  and  respectively 
severance charges as a result of a reduction in staff accounted for approximately  of the operating expenses in partially offset by a commensurate decrease in salary expense 
the decrease from to reflected the staff cuts in partially offset by the opening of the new offices in london and australia in late interest expense is due primarily to funds borrowed in to replace capital as a result of losses from the northridge earthquake 
the decrease in the interest expanse from to is due primarily to paying down part of the loan balance and lower interest rates 
the and interest expense includes  and  of interest expense on the company s rollback liability under california proposition income taxes

the company had net operating loss carryforwards of million at december  and million at december  which was fully utilized in the company had alternative minimum tax amt carryforwards of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the amt carryforwards were primarily attributable to the tax benefits from the municipal bond interest 
the company is reviewing its investment philosophy and will most likely reduce its municipal bond portfolio 
as of december  the net deferred federal tax asset was million as compared to million at december  at december  the company had a  valuation allowance against its deferred federal tax asset 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred federal tax asset recorded at december  is realizable and therefore  has not provided for any valuation allowance at december  this belief stems from a long history of taxable income prior to the northridge earthquake in  the immediate actions management took to prevent another loss of such magnitude  and the inclusion of taxable income generated by the somerset companies in the federal income tax return beginning july  equity income in affiliated company 
the company holds an equity interest in riverside  which through its wholly owned subsidiary  riverside corporate underwriters limited  is admitted to underwrite at lloyd s of london as a corporate name with limited liability 
the company records its share of riverside s underwriting results when sufficient information becomes available to provide reasonable estimates of earned premiums and losses 
during  primarily in the third quarter  the company recorded its share of the and underwriting earnings amounting to  after tax 
net income 
the company s net income improved in to income of million from a loss of million in the loss was primarily attributable to the northridge earthquake which also adversely impacted earnings as previously discussed 
the net income of million reflects more normal experience even with the rate decreases in the marine business 
in november  the voters of the state of california approved proposition  which required most property and casualty insurance companies  among other things  to reduce rates charged to california insureds to a level below november  levels 
on march   the company agreed with the commissioner to settle its rollback liability under proposition the settlement cost the company approximately million net of recoveries from reinsurers of which approximately million was recorded in each of and liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
operating cash flow has been used primarily to acquire additional investment assets with net purchases during  and of million  million and million  respectively 
at december   there were no material commitments for capital expenditures  although the company has committed approximately million to enhance its hardware and software computer systems in invested assets and cash excluding fiduciary funds held by the somerset companies have grown from million at december  to million at december  to million at december  investment income during this period was million in  million in and million in the average yield of the portfolio  excluding net realized capital gains  was in and and decreased to in  reflecting the prevailing interest rates during those years 
as of december   all debt and equity securities held by the company were classified as available for sale securities 
the majority of the invested assets are in municipal bonds rated a or better by standard poor s or moody s  or are in us treasury bonds 
navigators has avoided investing in high yield bonds 
therefore  the company has no significant exposure to credit risk since the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio does not contain any non investment grade bonds 
the portfolio has an average maturity of less than seven years 
management continually monitors the composition and cash flow of the investment portfolio in order to maintain the appropriate levels of liquidity 
this ensures the company s ability to satisfy claims or expenses as they become due 
the company s credit agreement  which was amended on november  the amended credit agreement  provides for a million revolving credit loan facility of which million was being utilized at december  and a million letter of credit facility of which million in pounds sterling million was being utilized at december  the letters of credit consist of in pounds sterling  for the company s portion of the business conducted by riverside and in pounds sterling  and in pounds sterling  for capacity being provided for two separate lloyd s of london marine syndicates 
the amended credit agreement is collateralized by shares of common stock of the active subsidiaries of the company other than nic insurance company and somerset asia pacific pty limited 
the amended credit agreement contains covenants common to agreements of this type 
the aggregate amounts available under the revolving credit loan facility decrease in quarterly increments in the amount of  commencing with the quarter beginning january  through the quarter ended september   and in varying increments thereafter through december  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
total stockholders equity was million at december   a increase for the year primarily as the result of the company s earnings in as of december   the company has paid approximately million of claims related to the northridge earthquake  of which approximately million is subject to indemnification by reinsurers 
to date the company has experienced no significant difficulties collecting reinsured losses 
the company was not in compliance with the naic s iris two year overall operating ratio in the exceptional value derived from this ratio was primarily due to the underwriting losses resulting from the northridge earthquake 
if the two year overall operating ratio is or more  the naic deems such results to be exceptional 
during  the company s two year overall operating ratio was 
the company was within the usual values for all iris ratios as of december  the company s reinsurance has been placed with various us companies rated a or better by am best company  inc  as well as with foreign insurance companies and with selected syndicates of lloyd s of london lloyd s 
certain syndicates at lloyd s loss syndicates and the lloyd s market as a whole have reported significant losses in recent years 
the company has not placed any material amounts of reinsurance with these loss syndicates 
pursuant to the implementation of lloyd s plan of reconstruction and renewal  a significant portion of the company s recoverables from the loss syndicates are now reinsured by equitas a separate uk department of trade authorized reinsurance company established to reinsure outstanding liabilities of all lloyd s members for all risks written in the or prior years of account 
the company believes that the cash flow generated by the operating activities of the company s subsidiaries  including the somerset companies  will provide sufficient funds for the company to meet its liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
beyond the next twelve months  cash flow available to the company may be influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions and conditions in the insurance and reinsurance markets  as well as fluctuations from year to year in claims experience 
economic conditions the company is a specialty insurance company and periods of moderate economic recession or inflation tend not to have a significant direct effect on the company s underwriting operations 
they do  however  impact the company s investment portfolio 
in  the company s yield on its invested assets declined and the company s investment income was negatively impacted by lower yields 
management considers the potential impact of these economic trends in estimating navigators loss reserves 
management believes that the underwriting controls it maintains  plus the fact that the majority of navigators business is in lines of insurance which have relatively short loss payout patterns  both assist in estimating more accurately ultimate claim costs and lessen the potential adverse impact of the economy on navigators
