sales in the environmental products and services segment declined by compared to last year 
in the textile chemical specialties segment  sales in the north america  asia and europe divisions improved over the prior year 
north america and asia division sales improved by over a substantial increase in textile chemical volume in mexico  smaller increases in canada and taiwan  new product sales in the us  and the impact of the first full year of sales in korea  more than offset the continued general weakness in the us textile market  the decline in the related organic chemicals business due to reduced customer toll manufacturing requirements  and a slight drop in average us selling prices 
europe division sales improved in terms of us dollars and in terms of local currencies 
physical volume increased primarily due to the company s continued success in penetrating newer geographical markets as well as new product introductions 
overall selling prices in terms of dutch guilders improved versus the prior year 
sales in the environmental product and services segment were favorably impacted by improvement in two product lines 
biochemical sales improved due to increased volume in products for the institutional  consumer and bioremediation markets  combined with a slight selling price increase 
specialty polymers sales improved due to an increase in average selling prices and the impact of the mid year purchase of the specialty polymers business of the chemical images co 
more than offsetting these improvements was a substantial decline in membrane sales which resulted from significantly lower export volume and an average selling price decrease 
continued weak market conditions in the us and a drop in average selling prices resulted in lower sales volume in the ion exchange product line 
the overall gross margin for increased to from last year s as both of the company s segments showed year to year improvements 
in the textile chemicals specialties segment  the gross margin increased to from the prior year s 
the gross margin in north america and asia increased almost percent to due to reduced freight expenses  production improvements and lower raw material costs 
these were partially offset by a slight reduction in selling prices and higher manufacturing expenses 
selling price increases  new products selling at higher margins  lower raw material costs and the continued favorable currency impact of a weaker guilder as compared with the other european currencies  all combined to increase the gross margin in europe to from last year s 
the gross margin in the environmental products and services segment was for the year  an improvement of almost two percent compared to the prior year 
gross margin in the ion exchange product line improved as a result of lower raw material costs  primarily styrene  and production cost controls  partially offset by lower selling prices  increased freight costs  unfavorable manufacturing variances and reduced inventory levels 
gross margin also increased significantly in the specialty polymer product line due to higher overall average selling prices  reduced raw material costs  principally styrene  and the favorable impact of higher margins gained from the june purchase of the chemical images specialty polymer business 
biochemical product line margins showed a small increase due to a slight decrease in raw material costs combined with a slight increase in selling prices 
the membrane product line gross margin declined in as compared with due to overall average selling price decreases and unfavorable manufacturing inventory variances which were partially offset by lower raw material costs and continued cost controls 
operating expenses as a percent of sales for the year increased to as compared to last year s 
in the textile chemical specialties segment  expenses as a percentage of sales increased as a result of headcount additions in r d and marketing in north america and increased environmental  compensation and legal costs

compared to operations sales for improved by compared to  the result of increases in the environmental products and services segment and the textile chemical specialties segment of and  respectively 
the environmental products and services segment experienced sales growth in the ion exchange  specialty polymer and biochemicals product lines 
ion exchange resins sales increased due to improved business activity in the industrial resin product line 
however  as in  average selling prices declined by because of continued market competition and resin overcapacity 
market share remained flat 
sales of specialty polymers jumped due to higher selling prices and a substantial increase in business in the toners product line 
biochemical product line sales increased due to increases in the average selling price  initial revenues gained from a land farming bioremediation project for a major us oil company  and improved industrial  municipal and foreign sales volumes 
reverse osmosis membrane product line sales remained relatively flat year to year 
sales in the textile chemical specialties segment increased substantially in both the america and europe divisions 
the america textile chemical business increased due to the acquisition of the auralux corporation in january  the full year effect of the july acquisition of the cnc international textile chemical business  and improved sales of liquid for solid  preparation  garment finishing and carpet products 
overall quantities sold increased 
however  average selling prices declined by due to product mix and competitive pricing to maintain existing business

average selling prices in terms of dutch guilders and excluding year to year currency fluctuations increased slightly 
us organic chemical product line sales improved due to increased average selling prices combined with additional custom distillation and flaking business 
gross margin for equaled versus in as both segments showed year to year declines 
the environmental products and services segment gross margin was as compared with in margins in the ion exchange and specialty polymers product lines dropped due to substantial increases in the cost of several major raw materials  particularly styrene  and overall selling price decreases  partially offset by favorable manufacturing variances and cost control measures 
an unfavorable product mix resulted in a drop in the biochemical product line gross margin 
production yield improvements and lower costs for a major raw material combined to improve the reverse osmosis membrane product line margins which more than offset an average selling price decrease 
the textile chemical specialties segment gross margin dropped to from s level of 
the america textile chemical division gross margin fell due to an unfavorable product mix  particularly in the finishing product line  increased raw material costs and lower average selling prices 
these negatives were somewhat offset by lower freight costs  better manpower utilization and productivity improvements 
the europe textile chemical division margins declined due to the weakness of the lire in italy  the company s largest market in europe  and increased us dollar translated costs relating to the strong guilder in the netherlands  where manufacturing costs are incurred 
also impacting the european margin were higher raw material costs which were only partially offset by slight increases in average selling prices 
the organics product line margin improved in over due to product mix and increased average selling prices which more than offset higher raw material and manufacturing costs 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the year improved slightly to as compared to last year s as both of the company s segments continued with cost control measures while sales remained on the upswing
