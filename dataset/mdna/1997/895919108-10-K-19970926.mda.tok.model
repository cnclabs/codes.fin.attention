item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations annual results of operations the following table sets forth the percentages that income statement items are to net sales for the years ended june   and year ended june  net sales cost of sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative litigation charges income from operations interest income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income net sales net sales in fiscal increased to million  or  above the million reported in fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily due to increases in the unit volume shipments of graphical user interface gui accelerators and graphics controllers of approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal but was partly offset by the decrease in average selling prices asps of approximately from asps 
sales of portable products increased to approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal from only in fiscal sales of gui accelerator desktop products declined to approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal from approximately in fiscal net sales in fiscal amounted to million  or  above the million reported in fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily due to increases in the unit volume shipments of gui accelerators  graphics controllers and video processing products of approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in the asps of approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the shift in product mix toward gui accelerator products 
the increase in unit volume was primarily attributable to sales of the company s higher performance gui accelerator products introduced during the year and significant growth of the overall pc market during fiscal sales of higher priced gui accelerator products rose to approximately of net sales in fiscal from approximately in fiscal the company has made a major effort to design products to fill the needs of leading pc systems manufacturers as well as the needs of adapter card manufacturers 
sales to leading pc systems manufacturers represented approximately of net sales for fiscal  an increase from in fiscal  and in fiscal sales to asian customers  primarily in hong kong  taiwan  korea and japan  accounted for  and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
the company expects that asian customers will continue to account for a significant portion of its sales for the next year and expects sales to leading pc systems manufacturers to continue to increase 
sales to three customers accounted for approximately  and of net sales for fiscal  approximately  and of net sales for fiscal  and approximately   and of net sales for fiscal substantially all of the sales transactions were denominated in us dollars during all periods 
the company plans to develop new and higher performance gui accelerators  graphics controllers and multimedia products to sell to existing customers as well as new customers in asia  north america and europe 
the company s future success depends upon its successful introduction of these and other new products on a regular and timely basis and upon those products meeting customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the development of new products or to commence shipments of new products in a timely manner  or that product specifications will not change during the development period 
in addition  even if such new products are successfully developed and shipped  there can be no assurance that they will be successful in the marketplace 
gross margin trident s gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross margins were generally higher in fiscal because of a product mix which was more heavily weighted towards notebook gui accelerators with higher gross margins and continued reductions in manufacturing cost for all products 
gross margin remained constant at in both fiscal years and the company believes that the prices of high technology products decline over time  as competition increases and new  advanced products are introduced 
the company expects asps of existing products to continue to decline  although the asps of the company s entire product line may remain constant or increase as a result of introductions of new higher performance products often with additional functionality which are to be sold at higher prices 
the company s strategy is to maintain gross margins by developing new products that have higher margins through its custom design methodology and migration to new process technology  and reducing manufacturing costs by large volume production 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis or that it can reduce manufacturing costs 
research and development research and development expenditures increased to million in fiscal from million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
research and development expenditures as a percentage of net sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the increase in headcount and associated personnel related costs  increased depreciation  and increased non recurring engineering expenses and outside engineering services resulting from the company s increased research and development efforts during the year 
in fiscal  a multimedia research and development group was created to develop multimedia features and to integrate them with the company s core graphics technology or design them as a stand alone product 
the increase in expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal also was due to the increase in personnel related costs associated with the company s increased research and development efforts during the year 
the company intends to continue making substantial investments in research and development  and it expects research and development costs to increase during fiscal because of anticipated increases in costs associated with the development of new products 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenditures increased to million in fiscal from million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenditures as a percentage of net sales were   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
selling expenditures increased to million in fiscal from million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
general and administrative expenditures increased to million in fiscal from million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
selling costs in fiscal were higher than in fiscal due to additional staffing for an oem sales team and increased marketing personnel 
selling costs in fiscal were higher than in fiscal because of additional sales staff in the us and in asia 
general and administrative expenditures were higher in fiscal than in fiscal primarily due to increases in additional human resources and information systems personnel 
higher general and administrative expenses in fiscal than in fiscal were also due to increases in personnel related expenses 
the company expects selling  general and administrative expenditures to increase in absolute amounts during fiscal as it increases its sales and administrative activities 
litigation charges on august   a class action lawsuit alleging violations of federal securities laws was filed in the us district court for the northern district of california against the company and certain other parties 
the company settled the lawsuit in june for million 
pursuant to the settlement  the company took a pretax charge of million in the year ended june  for the amounts expected to be paid in settlement and in legal expenses 
interest income  net the amount of interest income earned by the company varies directly with the amount of its cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and the prevailing interest rates 
interest income decreased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of declining interest rates in fiscal interest income increased to million from million in fiscal from fiscal  primarily because of a shift in the company s investment portfolio to taxable instruments with higher interest rates 
a significant amount of the interest earned by the company during fiscal and was not subject to income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes  the provision for income tax was  for fiscal year  and the effective income tax rate was below the statutory rate primarily because of operations in foreign countries with lower income tax rates 
in addition  a significant portion of earned interest was not subject to federal income tax in fiscal and future results  forward looking statements this report contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements regarding expected increases in sales to systems manufacturers  expected increases in sales and marketing personnel  expected increases in research and development and general and administrative expenses  trends in the graphics marketplace and the introduction of new technologies in the company s products 
such forward looking statements represent management s current expectations  are not guarantees and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary significantly from those expected by the company 
the factors that could affect actual results include those specified below  as well as those specifically identified elsewhere in this report 
the company has experienced fluctuations in its operating results in the past and anticipates such fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations have been caused by a variety of factors  including seasonal customer demand particularly during the summer when sales of pcs have traditionally been slower  the timing of new product introductions  the acceptance of new products  competitive pressures on average selling prices  the availability of foundry and assembly capacities and changes in the mix of products sold and changes in the company s customer mix 
the company s prior performance should not be presumed to be an accurate indicator of future performance 
future results will depend substantially upon the company s ability to bring new products and technologies to market on a timely basis  and upon the acceptance of those products 
also  future results will depend upon the market s acceptance of the company s customers products which incorporate the company s products  and the amount and timing of expenditures for research and development  and for selling  general and administrative functions 
operating results would be adversely affected by a downturn in the market for desktop or portable pcs  the company s ability to predict product demand and manage its inventory  and order cancellations or rescheduling 
because the company is continuing to increase its operating expenses for personnel and new product development  it would be adversely affected if its sales did not increase correspondingly 
the company s future operating results also may be affected by various factors that are beyond its control 
these include adverse changes in general economic conditions  political instability  governmental regulation or intervention affecting the personal computer industry  government regulation resulting from us foreign and trade policy  and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates particularly in relation to the us dollar and asian currencies 
because the company s customers distribute their products worldwide  changes in the global graphics marketplace  such as the shift in market share from asian clone makers to leading north american pc systems manufacturers  have affected and will continue to affect the company s operating results 
furthermore  the company s operating results will fluctuate with changes in the asian economies  particularly those of taiwan and hong kong  since the company s revenues have been and are expected to be generated primarily from customers in asia 
the market for graphics controllers has become increasingly competitive  and the company s results could be adversely affected by the actions of existing or future competitors  including the development of new technologies  the incorporation of graphics functionality into other components and claims by third parties of infringement of patent or similar intellectual property rights 
the company s products are extremely complex devices 
the company establishes and implements test specifications and imposes quality standards upon its suppliers and also performs separate application based compatibility and system testing for its products 
however  its customers may discover defects in the company s products related to their particular application 
to the extent that the company is unable to remedy defects or provide products able to meet its customers requirements  the company may experience lower revenues and excess inventories which could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company currently relies on several independent foundries to manufacture its products either in finished form or wafer form 
if a foundry terminates its relationship with the company or the company s supply from a foundry is interrupted or terminated for any other reason  such as a natural disaster  the company may not have sufficient time to replace the supply of products manufactured by that foundry 
while the company has made significant investments to secure foundry capacity  there can be no assurance that it will obtain sufficient foundry capacity to meet customer demand in the future  particularly if that demand should increase 
the company is continuously evaluating potential new sources of supply 
however  the qualification process and the production ramp up for additional foundries have in the past taken  and in the future could take  longer than anticipated 
there can be no assurance that capacity from current foundries and new foundry sources will be available to satisfy the company s requirements on a timely basis or at acceptable quality or per unit prices 
in addition  the company s products are assembled and tested by several independent subcontractors 
the company s reliance on independent manufacturing  assembly and testing houses involves a number of risks  including the lack of guaranteed capacity and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality assurance and costs 
constraints or delays in the supply of the company s products  because of capacity constraints  unexpected disruptions at the foundries or assembly or testing houses  delays in obtaining additional production at existing foundries or from new foundries  shortages of raw materials  or other reasons  could result in the loss of customers and other material adverse effects on the company s operating results  particularly if the company is forced to purchase products from higher cost foundries or pay expediting charges to obtain additional supply in a timely manner 
the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
factors such as new product announcements by the company or its competitors  quarterly fluctuations in the company s operating results and general conditions in the graphics controller market may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
these conditions  as well as factors that generally affect the market for stocks of high technology companies  could cause the price of the company s stock to fluctuate substantially over short periods 
the company s ability to manage any further growth will require significant expansion of its research and development and marketing and sales capabilities 
in particular  sales to large system manufacturers in diverse markets and their requirements for design support would place substantial demands on trident s research and development and sales functions 
in addition  the company s ability to manage any further growth will depend upon its ability to manage and expand its foundry relationships 
should trident s management fail to expand these functions to keep pace with growth should it occur  the company s business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was mainly due to profitable operations  decreases in inventory and other assets  and adjustment of non cash expenses  and primarily offset by increases in accounts receivable and decreases in accounts payable 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was mainly due to profitable operations  adjustment of non cash expenses and expansion of vendor credit  offset by increased requirements for working capital due to increases in accounts receivable  inventory and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
capital expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  the company issued  shares of common stock which generated million of cash 
during fiscal  the company issued  shares of common stock which generated million of cash 
during fiscal  the company issued  shares of common stock which generated million of cash 
inventory decreased during fiscal to a level of million at year end from million at the end of fiscal the decline in inventory is the result of lower inventory levels of d parts  and to shorter manufacturing cycle times 
in may  the company obtained a million unsecured revolving bank credit line  which expires on december   of which no amounts are currently outstanding 
the availability of the credit facility depends upon the company s meeting certain financial ratios and operating results 
the company has renegotiated its june wafer purchase agreement with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc 
this agreement committed the company to purchase and the supplier to provide a certain number of wafers each year through december  in january tsmc reimbursed us million to trident in conclusion of the formal agreement 
the company and tsmc continue to maintain their semiconductor foundry relationship 
in august  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with united microelectronics corporation umc  under which the company committed to invest an amount of new taiwan dollars currently equivalent to approximately us million for a equity ownership in a joint venture with umc and other venture partners to establish a new foundry  united integrated circuits corporation uicc 
under the agreement  the new foundry guarantees to trident 
of the foundry s total wafer supply 
the company made the first payment  amounting to us million  in january the company made an additional payment of us million in january the final payment under the joint venture agreement  estimated to be us million  is currently anticipated in november the company s investment in the uicc joint venture is intended to secure capacity so that it can meet expected increased demand  should it occur 
however  there are certain risks associated with the transaction including the company s ability  together with its partners  to fully utilize the capacity of uicc 
the company will continue to consider transactions to secure additional foundry capacity as circumstances warrant 
the agreement with umc has utilized a significant amount of trident s available funds  however the company believes its current resources are sufficient to meet its needs for at least the next twelve months 
the company regularly considers transactions to finance its activities  including debt and equity offerings and new credit facilities or other financing transactions
