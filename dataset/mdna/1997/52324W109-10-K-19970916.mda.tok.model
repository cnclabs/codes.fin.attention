overview since the company s founding in  the company has been designing  manufacturing and selling high performance signal analyzers to scientists engaged in hep research 
since calendar year  the company has applied its hep technology to the design and development of digital oscilloscopes  its principal product 
digital oscilloscopes are signal analyzers that capture electronic signals  convert them to digital form and perform sophisticated measurements and analyses 
the company s digital oscilloscope products are used by design engineers and researchers in a broad range of industries  including electronics  computers and communications 
in  the company introduced its first digital oscilloscope product 
commencing in fiscal  the company began to focus its digital oscilloscope product offerings on a single high performance product family  the series  which has resulted in a significant increase in revenues 
the company s total revenues were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  and revenues from digital oscilloscopes and related products accounted for approximately  and of the company s total revenues for those fiscal years 
in  the company adopted a performance improvement strategy pursuant to which the company hired new managers  including a new chief executive officer  to supplement the existing management team 
as part of the performance improvement strategy  the company s worldwide sales organization was restructured  the company s united kingdom research and development facility was closed and the company s product offerings were streamlined to focus on a single family of high performance digital oscilloscopes  the series 
in fiscal  the company expanded its high end market product offerings with a second family of products  the lc series of digital oscilloscopes 
the primary focus on high performance products  together with management s continued emphasis on operational improvements  have resulted in efficiency gains in product development  manufacturing  marketing  sales and service 
these factors  together with an increase in revenues  have contributed to an increase in operating margin from for the fiscal year ended june  to  excluding the impact of restructuring charges  for the fiscal year ended june  the company believes that certain models of its series and lc series offer the highest sampling rate  and others the largest processing memory  available to date in the digital oscilloscope market 
the company s original digital oscilloscope technology was derived from its historical efforts in developing products for high energy physics hep research 
since its founding in  the company has designed and manufactured signal analyzers for a number of leading hep research laboratories 
the company s signal analyzers were used in nobel prize winning experiments at cern centre europeen pour la recherche nucleaire near geneva  switzerland and the brookhaven national laboratory in upton  new york 
sales of hep products have been declining and accounted for approximately  and of the company s total revenues for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
the company expects the decline in hep revenues to continue 
as a consequence  in january the company adopted a strategic business plan to reduce costs and improve asset utilization in its hep business 
under this plan  the company is redirecting its engineering resources within this business unit to focus principally on the development and sale of signal analysis chip sets and subsystems for hep applications as well as new commercial applications 
in connection with the plan  the company has undertaken a series of reorganization actions resulting in write downs  principally for inventory and other asset revaluations  and employee severance 
the restructuring plan is expected to be completed by the end of december and resulted in a charge to fiscal third quarter results of approximately million million after taxes 
the company has manufacturing facilities in both the united states and switzerland and purchases parts  components and sub assemblies from a variety of vendors around the world in a variety of currencies and sells its products around the world in a variety of currencies 
this subjects the company to certain risks including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in government policies and legal and regulatory requirements  political instability  transportation delays and the imposition of tariffs and export controls 
for information with respect to the risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and certain measures adopted by the company in an effort to mitigate to a degree such risks  see business foreign currency exchange 
in response to the continuing decline in hep manufacturing and revenues and in an effort to increase absorption of the fixed costs of its chestnut ridge facility  in june the company commenced manufacturing at such facility its model x digital oscilloscope to supplement its manufacturing operations in geneva 
in fiscal and  the company has increased oscilloscope production at chestnut ridge to include its model x and its newest model oscilloscope  the model lca 
this higher production volume has increased operating efficiencies at chestnut ridge 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total revenues represented by each line item in the company s consolidated statements of income years ended june  revenues digital oscilloscopes and related products high energy physics products service and other total cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses restructuring costs operating income other income expenses  net income before income taxes and extraordinary charge provision for income taxes income before extraordinary charge extraordinary charge for early retirement of debt net income comparison of fiscal years and total revenues increased to million in from million in  or  and represented record full year revenues for the company

on a geographic basis  total revenues increased to million in from million in  or  in the united states  to million in from million in  or  in europe and to million in from million in  or  in the rest of the world  principally japan and the rest of asia 
the increase in revenues was offset in part by approximately million in the current year attributable to the net impact of the strengthening of the united states dollar versus the japanese yen  swiss franc  french franc and german deutschemark  as compared to the exchange rates prevailing in the same period of the prior fiscal year 
revenues from digital oscilloscopes and related products increased to million in  including million dollars in fees for digital oscilloscope solutions  from million in this increase in revenues was primarily attributable to a increase in unit sales of the higher end products in the company s family of digital oscilloscopes including the x model introduced in june  together with sales of the lc series of color digital oscilloscopes introduced in fiscal average selling prices of digital oscilloscope and related products increased by as compared to fiscal as a result of a continuing change in the company s product mix towards higher end products 
in addition to the above fees  the company recognized million dollars in license fee revenues 
revenues from sales of hep products declined to million in from million in  or 
the company in recent years has experienced a continuing decrease in hep revenues due to a variety of factors  including a decline in united states government funding for defense and the phase out of the company s digitizer products 
the company believes that revenues from sales of hep products  which represented approximately of total revenues in as compared to approximately of total revenues in  are likely to continue to represent a declining portion of its total revenues in the future  attributable in part to lower anticipated order volumes 
as a result of this continued revenue decline  in january the company adopted a strategic business plan to reduce costs and improve asset utilization in its hep business

new pronouncements the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 earnings per share sfas no 
 which modifies the way in which earnings per share eps is calculated and disclosed 
currently  the company discloses primary eps 
upon adoption of this standard for the interim period ended december   the company will disclose basic and diluted eps and will restate all prior period eps data presented 
the company anticipates this change will have a material impact on the calculation of eps 
if sfas no 
was adopted for the fiscal year ended june   the company would have reported per share for the basic eps calculation
