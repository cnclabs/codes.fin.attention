see also the discussion under item business discontinued operation and notes a  h and j to the consolidated financial statements of the company included herein 
results of operations total revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of approximately 
the increase in revenue is primarily the result of the acquisitions of services only businesses in december and february of fiscal which generated million in revenue during the year offset by a decrease in product hardware and software sales with the transition to a mid range software offering as discussed above and in item business under the caption product transition 
the fiscal revenue increased approximately million from million in fiscal  an increase of approximately 
the acquisition of micro control in mid fiscal year accounted for million of this increase

it is expected that the new offices opened in fiscal and  as a group  will contribute to revenue and earnings in fiscal the company also expects to continue to seek opportunities to grow through new office expansion as it identifies qualified individuals in selected markets 
product revenue decreased approximately in fiscal from the decrease resulted primarily from the company s transition on october  from being a reseller of pro engineer software that was sold primarily on unix hardware to the pt modeler family of software products that operate only on intel machines 
the average sale price for one seat of pro e with a unix hardware platform was approximately  to  a seat of pt modeler operating on an intel hardware platform now sells for approximately  to  per seat 
in fiscal product revenue included approximately  of commissions from ptc related to sales of pro e to our former pro e customers or sales of pt within our sales territory

the company s right to market and support pro e software terminates on september  and it is uncertain as to whether that right will be extended beyond that time period 
service revenue increased approximately from fiscal to product gross margins improved to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the improvement in the current year is due to the margin earned on the pt modeler family of products that the company began marketing in october and the non recurring ptc indirect commissions of  noted above 
margins on the pro e software that the company sold in fiscal  and through october had a margin of between and 
parametric technology corporation has informed the resellers that this margin will be extended for one additional year through approximately september service gross margins improved to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the improvement from fiscal to is due primarily to the additional higher margin service revenue generated from the acquired services only businesses 
the current agreement the agreement between the company and ptc to market its products and software maintenance services expires on or about september  the company has been verbally notified by ptc and it is expected that the agreement will be renewed on the same terms for another year  although there can be no assurances that the agreement will be renewed 
the agreement contains certain cancellation provisions which allow either party to terminate the relationship for any reason with days notice 
in august the company received a notice from ptc questioning the company s hiring of several former ptc employees and threatening termination of the reseller agreements unless certain assurances are provided to them by september  the ability to continue the relationship as a ptc business partner is material to the business

before this one time charge  sg a increased approximately from fiscal to as a result of increased overhead expenditures from the fiscal acquisitions 
the company did not earn any interest income in fiscal and the cash generated from the sale of the nsg in fiscal was distributed to shareholders on december  in the form of a per share cash dividend 
during fiscal and available cash was invested at short term rates and the interest generated from that activity was offset against bank fees for other services provided to the company  such as lockbox charges 
during fiscal the company generated approximately  in interest income 
the fiscal results from continuing operations include a realized gain from the distribution of the dsn shares to the softech shareholders effective may  the dsn shares were received by the company from dsn as part of the proceeds from the sale of the nsg in september on september  the dsn shares had a market price of per share 
the market price of the dsn shares on the record date  may   was which generated the realized gain 
during fiscal the remaining  shares of dsn held by the company were sold 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was zero as a result of a federal tax benefit of  offsetting a state tax provision of  the federal tax benefit was generated from a current federal provision of  which was offset by the recovery of  of taxes paid in fiscal through the utilization of net operating losses nol carried back 
the effective tax rate was in fiscal and for fiscal the provision in each of the years is related primarily to state and local taxes 
the effective rate was different from the statutory rate primarily due to nol carried back to recover taxes paid in fiscal the company has research and development tax credits of  and net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  to offset future federal taxes that may be payable 
capital resources and liquidity the company ended fiscal with approximately  in cash and available for sale securities  a decrease of approximately  from the previous year

the company anticipates that it will need to utilize  and will be dependent on  the line of credit during the fiscal year to finance working capital needs 
the line of credit contains several financial covenants that must be maintained 
the financial covenants require that the company will at all times maintain the following tangible net worth and subordinated debt in the combined amount of not less than million  ratio of debt minus subordinated debt to tangible net worth of not more than two to one  and for each fiscal year  before tax net income of not less than 
the company is in compliance with the financial covenants of the line of credit at this time 
however  given the company s history  minimal operating income  dependence on the ptc relationship and limited financial resources there can be no assurances the company will be able to maintain the financial covenants 
in the event that the line of credit was terminated the company would seek other sources of funds through the sale or pledging of assets or through other means 
the statements made above with respect to softech s outlook for fiscal represent forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
these include general business and economic conditions  maintaining key reseller agreements with technology providers especially the reseller agreement with parametric technology corporation which expires on or about september   ability to quickly transition to a competitive software offering in the event the ptc reseller agreement is not renewed  acceptance of the market of a mid range software offering  and the ability of the company to attract and retain qualified personnel both in our existing markets and in new office locations
