additionally  manufacturing costs increased during the production stages 
income from operations income from operations for was approximately million  which declined by compared to operating income was negatively impacted by reduced margins arising from the costs of certain contractual requirements 
continuing losses at qtpi  which included unabsorbed production overhead in the absence of sales  and reserves for inventory and receivable write downs  contributed to the decrease in operating income

the company s financial condition improved through continued profitability on consolidated operations 
working capital remained at million  which was approximately the same as last year  despite highly leveraged activities 
operating cash flows provided by the government contract segment were consumed by the commercial packaging segment s operating cash requirements 
inventories  which were twice last year s levels despite a write down  increased pending shipment of finished goods that are subject to a contract dispute 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted mainly from revenue growth 
capital expenditures  primarily related to manufacturing build out  were financed initially by the line of credit facility  and subsequently refinanced with million of proceeds from a long term capital lease 
during the next two years  the company will incur costs associated with the relocation of its contract efforts from vint hill to fort monmouth 
some of these amounts may be mitigated through certain state grants 
the company intends to implement a wide area network covering twelve sites 
the cost of setting up three pilot sites is expected to exceed  of this amount  approximately  was expended in outlook forward looking statements contained in this report are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation report act of certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements

the current business environment for the defense contracting industry continues to be characterized by a general atmosphere of uncertainty 
this uncertainty is the result of several factors including defense budget cuts  base closures and consolidations  and increased competitive pressures 
these factors will continue to shape the defense contracting industry over the next several years 
however  given the emergence of regional threats and ease with which leading edge technologies can be acquired by potential adversaries  there is the possibility these trends may be curtailed or reversed 
in addition  several segments within the industry  such as the area of application programming and information warfare  will provide growth opportunities for contractors 
management anticipates that there will be little impact on the company s existing contracts during due to base closures 
vint hill farms station  the site of qtrd s major army support contract  is one of the bases scheduled to be closed by the dod in late however  the mission being supported at vint hill high technology engineering services has been relocated to fort monmouth 
the company will continue to provide support to this mission under its current contract 
it is anticipated that army work will continue to remain a significant percentage of the company s overall business over the next several years 
as a result of the decreased defense appropriations  competition among contractors has increased considerably 
large contractors who typically targeted only large programs  now pursue programs of any size 
therefore  bigger contractors have become the company s direct competitors 
further  competitive pressures have caused many firms to merge with other companies 
the competitors who remain often gain increased expertise and experience through the mergers  resulting in formidable competition for the company 
management believes the company is positioned well to withstand the rigors of the current environment through a superior technical track record and competitive pricing 
the company has invested over million in manufacturing equipment  plant build out and refitting costs at its newport news facility 
marketing efforts have elicited interest from prospective customers  one of which has provided funding for a prototype mold to produce samples for testing 
based on internal cash flow forecasts  management has determined that no impairment has occurred for its plant equipment and manufacturing technology 
results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity for may be negatively affected by factors such as the timing of the execution of any new agreements  and the lead time for machine retooling and testing in accordance with new customer specifications 
the company is unable to provide assurance that actual sales to other customers will be in line with forecasts
