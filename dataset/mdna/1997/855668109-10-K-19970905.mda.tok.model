item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations sales sales increased in following a increase in domestic sales accounted for almost all of the increase in the current year because of continued good economic conditions in our industry 
foreign sales were flat 
our foreign operations in brazil and scotland operate in very competitive marketing environments and continue to be faced with dealing with the effects of exchange rate changes 
the strong pound adversely affected export business from scotland and the weakening of brazil s currency caused the local currency sales increase to be reduced by eight percentage points after conversion to us dollars 
the increase in total company sales also came primarily from domestic operations  reflecting better us economic conditions as well as some added distribution channels 
foreign sales increased only modestly last year as brazil struggled with the effects of high real interest rates 
earnings before taxes pretax earnings are up for the year 
this follows a increase in cost of sales was about in  in  and in the improvement in these rates is consistent with the manufacturing effi ciencies and increased overhead absorption realized because of increased production levels  particularly in domestic operations where pretax earnings are up this year and were up last year 
on the foreign side  significant reductions in selling and general wages in brazil enabled our foreign pretax earnings to increase despite level sales 
in  just the opposite occurred when mandated wage increases in brazil  during a period when it was difficult to raise prices  caused a decline in our pretax foreign profit despite a slight increase in sales volume 
income taxes the effective tax rate is in compared to in and in tax exempt interest on short term investments in municipal bonds  puerto rico tax incentives and  until  dividends on shares of the company s stock owned by the esop have always contributed to an overall effective tax rate that is slightly lower than the combined us state and federal statutory rate 
however  as taxable income has increased in the past several years  the effect of these items has diminished 
in addition  the overall effective rate has been favorably impacted by lower rates in brazil starting in the relatively high effective tax rate in came about because of the monetary plan instituted in brazil at that time that created high local taxable income until pre plan inventories were used up  which has largely happened now 
although the statutory rate in brazil is now comparable to that in the us  nonrecurring permanent differences between book and taxable income for dividends paid to the us in and local monetary correction adjustments in reduced their effective tax rate substantially when reported in us dollars 
net earnings as a result of the above  net earnings were up in fiscal when compared to fiscal and net earnings were up when compared to foreign currency management the company does not engage in regular hedging activities to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
net monetary assets in scotland and brazil are approximately million and million  respectively 
although inflation in brazil has decreased to from over  in when their current economic plan was initiated  the brazilian economy continues to be considered hyperinflationary for financial reporting purposes 
the company anticipates that  if inflation continues at these relatively low levels in  the economy may cease to be considered hyperinflationary 
liquidity and capital resources years ended in june cash provided by operations    cash used in investing activities    cash used in financing activities    effect of translation rate changes on cash increase decrease in cash   cash flows from operating activities increased million in due mainly to the increase in net earnings of million  and changes in the components of working capital of million offset by increased levels of prepaid pension costs of million 
the major increase in working capital resulted from increased inventories of million to support increased levels of sales 
although had a similar increase in net earnings  they were largely offset by inventory increases resulting in a small decrease in cash provided by operations 
the company s investing activities consist mainly of expenditures for property  plant and equipment and the investment of cash not immediately needed for operations 
plant expenditures of  and million in  and are typical and the company anticipates similar levels of capital expenditures in the near term 
additions were a little higher than recent averages because of increases in plant square footage at several locations 
cash flows from financing activities are primarily the payment of dividends  which tend to be quite steady from year to year 
the company requires little debt to finance day to day operations and the proceeds from the sale of stock under the various stock plans tend to be used to purchase treasury shares 
treasury share purchases were million in compared to million in and million in the company maintains sufficient liquidity and has the resources to fund its operations under current business conditions 
the company maintains two lines of credit as discussed in the notes to the financial statements 
the company has not made significant borrowings under these lines during the past three years 
the lines were used primarily to finance acquisitions 
the company continues to maintain a strong financial position with a working capital ratio of to as of june  and to as of june  cash not immediately required for working capital is invested in high grade money market instruments with maturities generally less than one year however  see notes to financial statements regarding investments in puerto rico 
in certain cases  cash and short term investment balances of foreign subsidiaries may not be repatriated without adverse tax consequences and may be subject to regulatory restriction 
new accounting pronouncements the company will be required to adopt two new accounting standards in as discussed in the notes to the financial statements 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this item  as well as other portions of this document and the annual report  including the chairman s letter to stockholders  include forward looking statements about the company s business  sales  expenditures  foreign operations  debt service  liquidity and capital resources  and other operating and capital requirements 
in addition  forward looking statements may be included in future company documents and in oral statements by company representatives to security analysts and investors 
the company is subject to risks that could cause actual events to vary materially from such forward looking statements  including the following risk factors risks related to foreign operations for the period ended june   approximately of the company s sales were derived from foreign operations and  as of june   approximately of the company s net assets were located outside the united states 
foreign operations are subject to special risks that can materially affect the sales  profits  cash flows  and financial position of the company  including taxes and other restrictions on distributions and payments  currency exchange rate fluctuations  inflation  minimum capital requirements  and exchange controls 
in particular  the company s brazilian operations  which constitute over half of the company s revenues from foreign operations  can be very volatile  changing from year to year due to the political situation and high inflation economy 
as a result  the future performance of the brazilian operations is inherently unpredictable 
risks related to cyclical nature of the industry the market for the company s products is subject to general economic conditions  including the level of capital spending by industrial companies 
as such  recessionary forces decrease demand for the company s products and adversely affect performance 
risks related to competition the company s business is subject to direct and indirect competition from both domestic and foreign firms 
in particular  low wage foreign sources have created severe competitive pricing pressures 
under certain circumstances  including significant changes in us and foreign currency relationships  such pricing pressures might reduce unit sales and or adversely affect the company s margins
