cautionary statements additional important factors to be considered the company s future results could differ materially from those discussed in this document 
factors that could cause a contribution to such differences include  but are not limited to  the following rapid technological change 
the software industry is characterized by rapid change and uncertainty due to new and emerging technologies 
the pace of change has recently accelerated due to the internet  on line services  networking  and new programming languages 
there can be no assurance that dra will be successful in developing or acquiring product enhancements and new products necessary to keep pace with the changing technologies 
customer acceptance 
while the company performs extensive usability and beta testing of its new products  user acceptance and market penetration rates ultimately dictate the success of development and marketing efforts 
the company is currently in the later stages of development of a new system called taos 
contracts with governmental entities 
a substantial portion of the company s business is conducted with governmental entities 
both the award and execution of its governmental contracts are subject to numerous conditions  including the availability and appropriation of sufficient funding 
product ship schedules 
because a substantial portion of the company s revenues for each quarter is attributable to a limited number of orders and tends to be realized towards the end of each quarter  even short delays in new product releases or delays in the customers procurement processes can cause results to fluctuate substantially 
delays in the release of taos could have a significantly negative impact on the company s sales and results of operations 
because of the complexities inherent in developing software products as sophisticated as those sold by the company and the lengthy testing periods associated with such products  no assurance can be given that future product introductions by the company will not be delayed 
in the future  the company s revenues will be increasingly dependent on sales of taos  which is currently being developed 
the timing of the completion of this system  which is based on object oriented client server design  may be affected by multiple factors  including rapid technological change  dependence on third party suppliers  and the relative scarcity of qualified technical staff 
competition 
the library automation industry is highly competitive 
a number of companies offer products that target the library automation market 
dra competes with software vendors whose products operate on digital hardware platforms and software vendors whose products operate on different platforms 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  and sales resources than dra 
dependence on and relationship with digital 
although dra is moving away from a strong dependence on digital computers  a substantial portion of the company s revenues are still derived from digital hardware and licensing of the company s software  which was originally designed to operate on digital computers 
dependence on key personnel 
dra s continued success depends in large part on certain key personnel  including michael j 
mellinger  its founder  president  and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of mr 
mellinger and the inability of the company to attract and retain a suitable replacement could have a material adverse effect on the company 
principal shareholders 
michael j 
mellinger and f 
gilbert bickel iii combined own in excess of percent of the common stock outstanding 
as a result  mr 
mellinger and mr 
bickel may be able to effectively control the outcome of certain matters requiring a shareholder vote 
page possible acquisitions 
the company may make acquisitions in the future 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or little direct experience  and potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies
