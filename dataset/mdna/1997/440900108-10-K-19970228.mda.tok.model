 net revenue from services cost of services gross margin comparison of to net revenues 
consolidated net revenues increased approximately million or from million in fiscal to million for the year ended november  while revenues increased in all areas of the company s operations  the primary growth  in dollars  was in the homecare and hss staffing groups 
net revenues of the home care group increased approximately million  or  from million in fiscal to million for fiscal volume was the primary factor  as visits increased from approximately  to  for the years ended november  and  respectively 
additionally  an improved mix of higher skill services contributed to higher proprietary revenues 
the mix of proprietary and medicare visits remained relatively the same and the resulting rates per visit remained stable as well 
net revenues of the hss staffing group increased approximately million  or  from million in fiscal to million for the year ended november  with hourly revenue rates only increasing marginally  the increase in revenue is largely attributable to an increase in hours billed 
with the acquisition of a therapy company in the second quarter of and the opening of four clinics  as previously discussed  net revenues from the company s rehabilitation services group increased by approximately  or  from million to million for the years ended november  and  respectively 
not included in their net revenues are the common patients and other synergies created with the homecare group 
the company s management services group  established during  generated net revenues of approximately  for its first partial year of operations 
cost of services 
direct expenses of the homecare group increased by  the same rate of increase as for net revenues  from million to million  an increase of million from fiscal year to fiscal year  respectively 
cost of services for the hss staffing group increased by million  or  from million to million  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this rate of increase is comparable to the rate of increase for net revenues 
the rehabilitation services group experienced increases in direct expenses  primarily salaries and benefits  in excess of its increases in net revenue 
direct expenses increased approximately  or  from  to  for the fiscal years ended november  and  respectively 
the increases are directly attributable to the newly opened clinics and the therapy company acquisition 
much of the costs of support services for the management services group were furnished by existing company support services functions  such as accounting  reimbursement and payroll and  therefore  was absorbed into corporate overhead 
the group did  however  incur additional incremental direct costs of approximately  gross margin 
the company s gross margin before selling  general and administrative expenses is the difference between amounts charged by the company to its clients or amounts reimbursed by third party payors and wages and other direct expenses the company pays to its medical personnel or to support service personnel in the case of the management services group 
the company s gross margin is subject to a number of factors such as billing rates  pay rates and cost of travel and housing 
the impact of these factors vary due to competitive and seasonal factors as well as the geographic mix and type of service discipline and payor source being performed by the company 
the company s overall gross margin increased by million  or  from million to million for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
the gross margin as a percentage of net revenue  however  decreased from to 
although confronted with significant downward pressures on margins experienced throughout the healthcare industry  the company managed to maintain its gross margins in all areas except for rehabilitation services 
due to lower than expected revenues and significant declines in productivity  the gross margin from the rehabilitation group fell from approximately  to  in fiscal and  respectively 
without the impact of the rehabilitation services group  the company s gross margin percentage would have remained the same for fiscal to fiscal selling  general and administration expense 
selling  general and administration expenses increased by million  or  from million to million for the years ended november  and  respectively 
the increase is due primarily to the expansion of services and growth throughout the company mitigated somewhat by lower litigation and legal and other professional fees 
interest and other income expense 
the net expense increased by  from  to  from fiscal to  respectively  due to increased interest expense of  on an expanded line of credit largely offset by collection of receivables from sold operations 
pre tax net income 
pre tax net income decreased from approximately  to approximately  due to losses incurred in the rehabilitation services group offset by income generated in the management services group 
income taxes 
for fiscal  the company recognized a benefit for income taxes of  such benefit is primarily the result of recognizing the current defined tax benefit associated with the turnaround of temporary differences in the current year  offset partially by an increase in the valuation allowance 
extraordinary item 
in connection with the early extinguishment of its debt to its prior lender  the company incurred an extraordinary charge of  during the first quarter of comparison of to net revenues 
net revenues decreased approximately million  or  from million in fiscal to million for the year ended november  this decrease is directly attributable to the sale of the company s home health care operations in california  new york  and arizona on august  and the sale of its florida and texas operations in january and march of fiscal in fiscal  these sold operations contributed in excess of million to consolidated revenue 
net revenues from services provided by the company s homecare group decreased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended november   from approximately million for the year ended november  these decreases in revenues are principally due to the sale of certain company operations previously discussed  offset by an increase in net revenues within ongoing homecare operations of approximately million  or  from million to million for the fiscal years ended november  and  respectively 
the growth is attributed to increased medicare business within remaining homecare operations 
the revenues for the company s hss staffing group were down approximately million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to reduced demand for contract nursing staff in serviced hospitals 
since the acquisition  during its first nine months of operations in fiscal  the company s rehabilitative service business generated net revenues of approximately million 
the focus of this group will be on hospital rehabilitation facility management  providing therapy services to other home care companies  and expansion of its existing clinics in georgia and tennessee 
cost of services 
the cost of services for the homecare group decreased approximately million  or  from approximately million to approximately million for the fiscal years ended november  and  respectively 
the primary reasons for this reduction are the sale of certain homecare operations  discussed earlier  and lower estimated litigation losses based upon favorable trends in the resolution of certain independent contractor claims related to the dade county operations as discussed in part i 
this reduction in estimated litigation losses resulted in decreased cost of services in the fourth quarter by approximately  cost of services from the hss staffing group decreased to million in the year ended november  from million in the year ended november  the decrease in cost of services are attributable to a reduction in contracts primarily due to cutbacks of open positions less demand for nurses at various hospitals within the current services areas 
the cost of services for the company s rehabilitative services group were approximately  during its first nine months of operation in fiscal gross margin 
the company s gross margin decreased approximately million  or  from million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal this resulted from the sale of certain company operations previously discussed 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin increased from to approximately for the years ended november  and this increase resulted from the sale of low performing operations  the improvement of the expected settlement of certain claims discussed above  and a general improvement in operations 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from approximately million  or of net revenue  during to approximately million  or of net revenue  during the decrease is attributable to operations of the company being sold in late and early  offset by certain employee severance costs and litigation settlements 
bad debt expense decreased million  from million or of net revenues  in fiscal to approximately  or of net revenues  in fiscal the principal reason for this is the additional reserves required  in fiscal  related to the accounts receivable from sold operations 
interest and other income expense 
the net amount of interest and other income expense  changed from net income of  in to expense of  in this change resulted primarily from the recognition of the gain on the company s sale of its california  new york  and arizona home health care operations in the amount of  in fiscal interest costs were lower in due to average outstanding borrowings being less than they had been in pre tax net income 
pre tax net income increased by approximately million from approximately million for the fiscal year ended to approximately million for the fiscal year ended  and increased as a percentage of revenue from to 
income taxes 
the company recognized a net benefit for income taxes for the fiscal year ended november  of approximately  primarily as a result of certain tax deductible legal settlements which can be carried back to recover income taxes previously paid by the company 
the provision benefit for income taxes from to changed significantly as a result of the recognition of certain deferred tax assets which were fully reserved in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources general 
the company s capital requirements consist of funding current operations  expanding services provided by its home care  staffing and rehabilitative businesses  and the acquisition of compatible companies that can be integrated with existing operating units 
the company expects to meet short term liquidity needs through cash flow and borrowings available under its credit facility as discussed below 
prior line of credit 
at november   under an arrangement with a commercial finance company  the company had a million uncommitted revolving line of credit  of which million was reserved to support a standby letter of credit for the benefit of the company s workers compensation insurance carrier 
line of credit 
in february  under an arrangement with a commercial finance company  the company entered into an million uncommitted revolving line of credit  of which million was reserved to support a standby letter of credit for the benefit of the company s workers compensation insurance carrier 
at november   the letter of credit was at million 
the amount of the line of credit available to the company at any time is determined primarily by the eligible accounts receivable  as defined 
prior to november   the company obtained a verbal agreement  to be followed with a revised written commitment  to increase the line to million 
negotiations are in progress on the written commitment 
loan activity exclusive of the million reserved to support the standby letter of credit for the company s workers compensation insurance carrier for the two years ended november was as follows in millions  except percentages maximum outstanding borrowings outstanding at november amount available for additional borrowing weighted average interest rate early retirement of the prior line of credit resulted in the company incurring a penalty of approximately  and a write off of unamortized loan costs in the amount of approximately  the aggregate of which was recorded as an extraordinary charge in the first quarter of restrictive covenants under the line of credit 
the company s line of credit contains certain restrictive covenants precluding the company from paying any dividends  other than stock dividends  or purchasing  redeeming or retiring any of the company s capital stock 
in addition  written contracts with the government agencies operating the two hospitals in the us virgin islands to which the company provides traveler services are required 
if the company fails to have such written contracts in place  the commercial finance company providing the line of credit may restrict the definition of those eligible accounts receivable  so that no us virgin island accounts receivable are included 
currently written contracts are in place with expiration dates in september and november trade accounts receivable 
at november  and  the company had outstanding accounts receivables  net of allowances for doubtful accounts  of approximately million and million  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended november   turnover of accounts receivable decreased from to times per year and average days outstanding increased from days to days 
the resulting decreases in cash collections makes up approximately million of the increases in borrowing under our line of credit 
the company s us virgin island clients are historically slow paying 
at november  and  the average days outstanding for the us virgin island accounts were and days  respectively 
during the third and fourth quarters of  all outstanding accounts receivables relating to sold operations were written off as uncollectible 
these outstanding accounts receivables amounted to approximately  and were fully reserved at november  cash recoveries of these write offs  subsequent to year end  were approximately  minimal future recoveries are expected 
settlements due to and due from medicare 
periodically  the company estimates settlements due to the medicare program 
the estimated settlement amounts due are the result of interim reimbursement rates  at which the company was paid for its services throughout the year  exceeding the company s actual costs of providing such services and revisions by certain intermediaries of the company s reported reimbursable costs after the intermediaries review or audits of the company s cost report filings 
estimated settlements due from medicare are presented net of estimated settlements due to medicare in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
management s plans to fund settlements to medicare as they become due include negotiating extended payment plans  incurring additional borrowings under the line of credit  if available  or using proceeds from additional capital that may be raised 
however  there are no assurances that the company will be able to successfully utilize any of these three funding options 
for the twelve months ended november   the company had received notification from the medicare program s fiscal intermediaries of approximately  due to medicare 
through february  approximately  of this amount has been repaid under medicare approved repayment plans 
included in the  is approximately  which the medicare intermediaries are not pursuing in anticipation of the settlement of certain provider cost reports with amounts due to the company in excess of the  cash position 
net cash generated by used in operating activities was   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in addition to cash flow from operating activities  the company s overall cash position can be significantly affected by its investing and financing activities 
significant investing activities for the twelve months ended november  consisted of capital expenditures and acquisitions of therapy company 
the company s principal financing activities for the fiscal year ended november  consisted of net borrowings under the line of credit 
net working capital 
as of november   the company had current assets of approximately million and current liabilities of approximately million  resulting in net working capital of approximately million and a current ratio of x 
this compares to working capital of approximately million and a current ratio of x at november  cash and cash equivalents were approximately million at fiscal year ended november  as of november   the company s commitments that would require large or unusual amounts of cash  consisted of office rents  repayments to the medicare program  the severance obligation to a former officer and an amount due its current chairman and chief executive officer see notes and 
seasonality historically  the company s traveler business in the us virgin islands has not been subject to material seasonal fluctuations 
however  the traveler business in the rest of the united states has been seasonal  with demand for travelers being highest in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year september through february and lowest in the third quarter of the fiscal year june through august 
this is due largely to increased demand  particularly during the peak tourist and winter retirement home period in florida  coupled with an increase in the availability of nurses during the first and fourth quarters of the company s fiscal year 
the company s homecare business has not been subject to material seasonal fluctuations 
impact of inflation inflation  while moderate  continues to increase the cost of goods and services purchased by the company 
inflation is considered in all contract proposals developed for hospital and home care clients 
historically  inflation has not had a significant impact on the operations of the company 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
effective december   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
required  among other things  recognition of future tax benefits as an asset 
during  the company determined that  due to recurring losses in prior years and other factors  realization of the net deferred tax asset did not meet the more likely than not criteria of sfas no 
consequently  at november   the valuation allowance was increased so that the net deferred tax asset was fully reserved 
as a result of pre tax income generated in and  the company realized certain deferred tax assets previously reserved 
additionally  the company has recognized approximately  and  of its net operating loss carryforwards generated in fiscal and  respectively  as management believes that it is more likely than not the company will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize this asset 
the valuation allowance is subject to continual review and  as such  may be decreased in the future as substantive information becomes available about the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net deferred tax asset see note 
the effective tax rate for the provision benefit for income taxes during the fiscal years ended  and differ from the statutory tax rate 
this is primarily due to adjustments to the valuation allowance  as noted above  and the company s inability to derive a benefit from its net operating loss carryforwards in and and due to the increase in the valuation allowance discussed above
