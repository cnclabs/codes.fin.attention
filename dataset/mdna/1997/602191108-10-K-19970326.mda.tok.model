item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment the following discussion includes certain forward looking statements which are affected by important factors including  but not limited to  actions of competitors  termination of contracts at the convenience of the united states government  customer funding variations in connection with multi year contracts and follow on options that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements 
the company s primary business segment provides specialized computers and related peripheral equipment to the united states and foreign military defense departments 
equipment in this segment takes two primary forms 
the first of these is fully militarized products  usually designed especially for a particular mission area with demanding environmental and quality requirements 
the second of these is rugged products  usually based on a commercial baseline product  but adapted by the company to meet environmental and quality specifications that exceed the requirements for commercial products 
this entire segment has been impacted in recent years by reduced government spending and defense appropriations 
the militarized product area has been especially subject to defense budget cuts 
the military continues to reduce funding for the development and limited production quantities of highly customized systems and products 
the long design cycle for these programs creates an intangible cost in the form of rapid technological obsolescence 
some military programs that would have sought militarized equipment some years ago have modified the requirements to reflect a need for rugged or commercial products 
this trend has tended to benefit sales of the company s rugged product line 
even in the rugged product area  however  defense cuts have taken a toll 
competition in this area has become more keen in recent years  as many government contractors pursue fewer military programs 
through its commercial segment  the company develops  manufactures and markets commercial products primarily for transportation  telecommunications and in field maintenance markets 
its products are airborne cockpit printers  airline ticket and boarding pass printers  ruggedized internet terminals  mass storage devices  and derivatives of ruggedized hand held intel based computers and portable risc workstations originally developed for military applications
