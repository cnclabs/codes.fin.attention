related entities genzyme development partners  lp in  genzyme sponsored genzyme development partners  lp gdp  a research and development limited partnership that raised million through the private placement of limited partnership interests and warrants to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
a wholly owned subsidiary of genzyme is the general partner of gdp and holds a partnership interest therein 
the company entered into a contract with gdp to perform research and development of the sepra products for which the company was reimbursed its costs plus a fee 
the program to develop and market the sepra products is allocated to genzyme general 
all of gdp s capital available to fund development of the sepra products was spent by the end of the first quarter of additional funds will be required to complete the development and clinical testing of sepracoat tm and sepragel tm 
while genzyme is not obligated to fund additional development of the sepra products  it has funded such development since the first quarter of and will continue such funding during under the terms of the various agreements between gdp and genzyme  gdp has the exclusive right to sell seprafilm tm  sepracoat tm  sepragel tm  hal s tm and other ha based surgical products in the us and canada through a joint venture with genzyme the joint venture 
genzyme was granted back an exclusive license to sell these products outside the us and canada subject to a royalty on european sales of these products under certain circumstances 
the joint venture was formed in for the purpose of manufacturing and marketing gdp s products and commenced operations in following approval in august by the us food and drug administration the fda to market seprafilm tm in the us the business commencement date 
under the agreement between gdp and genzyme governing the joint venture the joint venture agreement  gdp has contributed to the joint venture the use of its technology and  and genzyme has contributed its agreement to manufacture and market the sepra products  to make non interest bearing loans to the joint venture in the amount of any working capital deficiency  to make capital contributions to the extent deemed necessary by the two venturers in connection with the business of the joint venture and to allow the use of such trademarks  tradenames and logos as the venturers shall determine to be necessary and advisable for manufacturing and marketing the sepra products 
the cost of sepra products purchased by the joint venture from genzyme is determined pursuant to a formula in the joint venture agreement 
the joint venture agreement calls for gdp and genzyme to determine  following the business commencement date  the allocation of profits and losses between the parties and the level of reimbursement to genzyme for providing general and administrative services to the joint venture 
in march  gdp and genzyme amended and restated the joint venture agreement as so amended and restated  the amended and restated joint venture agreement to address matters the original joint venture agreement provided were to be agreed upon on or about the business commencement date and to address certain other matters 
the amended and restated joint venture agreement is retroactive to august   the date of the first commercial sale of seprafilm tm  and provides that losses generated by the joint venture are allocated a the first  to gdp and then b to gdp and to genzyme  provided however  that to the extent a loss allocated to gdp would  pursuant to the terms of gdp partnership agreement  be allocated to the general partner rather than the limited partners  such loss is allocated to genzyme  and profits are allocated a the first million to gdp  b the next million to genzyme and c thereafter  to gdp and to genzyme 
the amended and restated joint venture agreement also provides that genzyme will receive no reimbursement for the general and administrative services it provides to the joint venture until the first year in which the joint venture is projected to generate revenues in excess of million at which time  genzyme will receive a quarterly commission equal to of the joint venture s revenues for such quarter 
in connection with arriving at agreement on the foregoing matters  the parties also agreed to amend the joint venture agreement to provide gdp with enhanced oversight mechanisms  including an audit right  and to eliminate genzyme s unilateral right to withdraw from the joint venture 
in connection with negotiating the amended and restated joint venture agreement  the joint venture entered into an exclusive marketing and distribution agreement the marketing and distribution agreement with genzyme whereby genzyme will act as sole distributor of the sepra products for the joint venture 
the joint venture agreed to sell sepra products to genzyme at the price at which genzyme is selling the applicable products to the end user less a distributor s discount subject to a minimum purchase price and also agreed to reimburse genzyme for certain costs incurred in connection with market introduction of the sepra products 
the economic terms of the proposed marketing and distribution agreement are intended to be substantially similar to those applicable if genzyme provided such services in its capacity as a venturer rather than as a distributor 
at the request of a special committee of directors of the general partner consisting of the two directors who are not affiliated with genzyme  genzyme also entered into a tax indemnification agreement the tax indemnification agreement with gdp in which genzyme agreed  subject to certain limitations  to indemnify the limited partners against loss of the benefits of certain research and development deductions certain limited partners have taken net of potential tax savings due to any resultant higher tax basis in the limited partnership interests

the option to purchase all of the limited partnership interests is exercisable during a day period commencing on august   but such commencement date will be accelerated under certain circumstances 
genzyme transgenics corporation 
in february  genzyme formed genzyme transgenics corporation gtc and transferred to it all assets and liabilities of its business in the field of transgenic technology as applied to the development and production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic uses in exchange for shares of gtc s stock 
in addition  genzyme exclusively licensed to gtc all patents  licenses and other intellectual property in the field excluding that related to a cf related protein 
as of december   genzyme owned approximately of gtc 
in march  genzyme and gtc entered into a convertible debt and development funding agreement under which i genzyme has made available to gtc a million credit line of debt payable on march  and convertible by either party into shares of gtc common stock  ii genzyme has agreed to fund the development costs associated with transgenic recombinant antithrombin iii atiii  and iii in exchange for funding such development costs and for making available the credit line  genzyme has received the right to co market atiii with gtc throughout the world  other than asia 
the agreement to fund the atiii program was due to expire on march  the parties have agreed to extend the agreement until june  and are negotiating an agreement to provide for long term development of the at iii program 
there can be no assurance that genzyme and gtc will reach a definitive agreement to provide for such development and  if no agreement is reached  genzyme s co marketing rights will terminate 
under other contractual arrangements between genzyme and gtc  genzyme general may engage gtc to perform transgenic research and development on proteins of interest to genzyme 
gtc has contracted with genzyme for purification and protein chemistry research and development services to be performed by genzyme general 
genzyme leases laboratory and office space to gtc and provides it with certain administrative and support services for which gtc pays fees based on genzyme s costs 
neozyme ii corporation 
neozyme ii corporation neozyme ii was formed in march to contract with genzyme to conduct research  development and clinical testing of biotherapeutic products for the treatment of cf 
in may  genzyme and neozyme ii completed an initial public offering of units which resulted in gross proceeds to neozyme ii of approximately million 
on october   genzyme completed a tender offer for the outstanding units of neozyme ii for per unit in cash in which of the units were tendered and accepted for payment at an aggregate purchase price of million 
each unit consisted of one share of callable common stock of neozyme ii callable common stock and one warrant to purchase two shares of ggd stock and 
share of gtr stock 
on december   neozyme ii was merged with a subsidiary of genzyme and the remaining outstanding shares of callable common stock were cancelled and converted into the right to receive per share in cash 
the callable warrants included in the untendered units separated from the shares of callable common stock converted in the merger and became exercisable on december specialty therapeutics genzyme general s strategy is to use its technological strengths  particularly its ability to modify and produce dna and proteins and its expertise in fermentation  carbohydrate engineering and gene therapy  to develop safe and effective therapeutic products to address major unmet medical needs 
genzyme general is currently selling ceredase r enzyme and cerezyme r enzyme and has several therapeutic products in various stages of the research  development  clinical testing and regulatory review processes

galactosidase fabry disease preclinical development prolactin maintenance of immune preclinical development system function chitinase anti fungal agent preclinical development research status indicates work up to and including small scale production of the targeted product 
preclinical development status includes work done to increase yields and standardize manufacturing processes and studies in animals to support an application to the fda to commence clinical testing in humans 
human clinical trials for products classified by the fda as drugs or biologics are generally conducted in three phases phase i  to determine safety and pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects  phase ii  to provide preliminary evidence of efficacy in the patient population targeted by the product  and phase iii  sometimes referred to as pivotal trials  to provide data for proof of safety and effectiveness 
pilot clinical studies are clinical trials for novel therapies  such as gene therapies  where the product is initially tested in the patient population targeted by the product for safety  pharmacokinetics and preliminary evidence of efficacy 
following completion of the pivotal clinical studies  an application for marketing approval of a new drug an nda or licensure of a biological product a pla is submitted to the fda 
ceredase r enzyme alglucerase injection and cerezyme r enzyme imiglucerase injection 
treatment with ceredase r enzyme or cerezyme r enzyme replacement therapy currently represents the only safe and effective treatment for gaucher disease  a seriously debilitating  sometimes fatal genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in an important enzyme in the body called glucocerebrosidase gcr 
this deficiency results in the accumulation of the lipid glucocerebroside in the body 
the disease is characterized by an enlarged liver or spleen  anemia  bleeding problems  bone and joint pain  fatigue and orthopedic complications such as repeated fractures and bone erosion 
ceredase r enzyme is a modified form of human gcr in which glycoprotein remodeling technology has been used to target gcr to the cells where the lipid accumulation occurs 
cerezyme r enzyme is a recombinant form of gcr which has been remodeled in a similar manner 
genzyme general is marketing these products directly to physicians  hospitals and treatment centers worldwide through a highly trained sales force 
this marketing effort is directed at identifying and initiating treatment for the  gaucher patients genzyme general believes exist worldwide 
currently  approximately one third of these patients are receiving treatment 
ceredase r enzyme and cerezyme r enzyme  together  are available in approximately countries worldwide 
ceredase r enzyme has received marketing approval in countries  most recently japan and belgium  with applications pending in two other countries 
genzyme is the first biotechnology company to obtain drug approval in japan without a partner 
cerezyme r enzyme has received marketing approval in four countries  most recently in canada and portugal  with applications pending in the european union and other countries 
genzyme general produces ceredase r enzyme from an extract of human placental tissue supplied by pasteur merieux  a french company that is the only significant commercial source of this material 
the current supply available is not sufficient to produce enough ceredase r enzyme to supply all present patients 
to address supply constraints  genzyme developed cerezyme r enzyme 
in october of  genzyme general received fda approval to manufacture cerezyme r enzyme in a new  large scale manufacturing plant located in boston  massachusetts 
once an uninterrupted supply of cerezyme r enzyme can be produced by the new plant  patients receiving ceredase r enzyme will be converted to cerezyme r enzyme 
genzyme general will be required to continue manufacturing ceredase r enzyme until the process of patient conversions is completed  which is expected to occur during the fourth quarter of any disruption in the supply or manufacturing process of ceredase r enzyme during the conversion period or in the supply or manufacturing process of cerezyme r enzyme may have a material adverse effect on revenue 
thyrogen r hormone 
genzyme general is developing thyrogen r hormone  a recombinant form of human thyroid stimulating hormone  for use as an adjunct to the approximately  to  diagnostic and therapeutic procedures undertaken each year to detect and treat metastases of thyroid cancer 
genzyme general believes that the administration of thyrogen r hormone may increase the effectiveness and result in fewer adverse side effects for patients undergoing current standard medical procedures for thyroid cancer 
thyrogen r hormone was demonstrated to be safe and effective in stimulating the uptake of radioiodine for whole body scanning in a phase i ii clinical study 
a phase iii multi center clinical study completed late in provided evidence that the use of thyrogen r hormone prior to diagnostic scanning greatly improved the quality of life in of thyroid cancer patients tested and was effective in producing scans that were as good as or better than conventional scans in of those patients 
to confirm the results of this study  genzyme general is conducting a second phase iii study  results from which are expected to be available in mid if the current study confirms the prior results  marketing applications are expected to be filed by the end of in the us and europe and by early in canada 
following its nda filing  genzyme plans to make thyrogen r hormone available to patients in the us who meet certain criteria under a treatment ind that allows genzyme to gather additional information regarding use of the product while recovering appropriate costs of the product and the treatment 
transgenic antithrombin iii 
atiii is a human blood protein that acts as an anticoagulant 
depressed levels of atiii can lead to increased risk of thrombosis clotting in patients with either hereditary atiii deficiency or an acquired atiii deficiency often associated with multiple disease states  such as sepsis  various surgeries  multiple trauma and liver disease 
natural atiii derived from donated human plasma currently is sold worldwide for multiple indications 
gtc is developing a transgenic source for atiii to address anticipated growth in the market to treat atiii deficiency by protein replacement therapy 
genzyme general and gtc believe that current sources of plasma derived atiii will be inadequate to address this growth 
in combination with tufts university school of veterinary medicine and smi genzyme limited  a joint venture between gtc and sumitomo metal industries  ltd  gtc has developed a herd of transgenic goats at its production facility in central massachusetts that produce active recombinant atiii 
in october  gtc announced that the results of a phase i trial conducted in the united kingdom showed transgenic atiii was well tolerated in healthy subjects 
in december  gtc commenced a phase i ii clinical trial of transgenic atiii in the us 
in this trial  the product will be administered to patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting in a dose escalating study to determine the safety of transgenic atiii in this patient population 
gtc expects to complete the trial during the first half of genzyme general is funding the development of transgenic atiii pursuant to an agreement with gtc under which genzyme general has obtained co marketing rights for the product outside of asia

gene therapy overview 
gene therapy is an innovative technology being developed by genzyme general to treat cf  cancer  gaucher disease and cardiovascular disease 
gene therapy involves the delivery of a gene responsible for production of a particular protein of interest into cells of a patient in order to trigger the cell to produce the encoded protein for some therapeutic purpose 
genzyme general s gene therapy research began in as part of its efforts to develop novel treatments for cf on behalf of neozyme i corporation neozyme i 
genzyme acquired the cf program from neozyme i and transferred it to neozyme ii in genzyme acquired neozyme ii in october see business related entities 
since  genzyme general has expended over million in gene therapy research and has established a broad proprietary core technology base that includes gene delivery systems  in vitro and in vivo model systems  production capabilities and a dedicated clinical and regulatory staff 
because of the innovative nature of gene therapy and public policy issues surrounding the insertion of new genetic information into cells  genzyme general expects that early clinical evaluation will continue to entail especially careful testing in a limited number of patients 
genzyme general is currently conducting pilot clinical studies of gene therapy products 
the timing and results of these initial studies will determine whether and when pivotal trials to determine safety and effectiveness will be undertaken 
these pivotal trials may involve large groups of patients for lengthy periods of time in order to address the uncertainties surrounding insertion of new genetic information into humans and to show clinical effectiveness in the treatment of a progressive disease 
cystic fibrosis 
cf is the most common fatal genetic disease affecting the caucasian population 
approximately one in every  infants in the us is born with the disease and there currently are approximately  cystic fibrosis patients in north america 
cf is caused by a mutation in the gene responsible for determining the molecular structure of a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr 
although improvements have been made over the last years in alleviating certain symptoms of the disease and delaying its progress  the underlying disease remains untreated and patients have an average life expectancy of only years 
genzyme general s work has concentrated on a gene therapy approach to correct the basic defect in cf cells whereby the mutant genes are augmented with genes that would enable the patient s cells to produce normal cftr protein 
genzyme general s scientists have demonstrated that the defective ion transport mechanism present in airway cells taken from cf patients can be corrected in vitro by the insertion of normal cftr genes into the cells 
the techniques for inserting genetic material into cells outside the body are not expected to be useful in gene therapy for cf  however  because there is no practical way to remove  treat and implant the treated cells in the airways of cf patients 
for this reason  genzyme general s proposed gene therapy product will likely need to be administered directly to the airways of the lung 
genzyme general also believes that its gene therapy product would need to be readministered periodically as the transferred gene ceases to function or is lost and as the treated cells naturally die and are replaced 
viral vectors 
in  genzyme general and collaborators at the university of iowa conducted a small study in cf patients using an adenovirus gene product administered to nasal epithelium 
results collected from the study showed that it is possible to correct the biochemical defect in cf cells in nasal epithelium in vivo 
the study results  published in october  were the first published report of a successful gene transfer in cf patients and the first successful application of an adenovirus vector in gene therapy 
in a publication reporting the results of a similar study  however  researchers from the university of north carolina questioned the efficacy of gene transfer using adenovirus 
in addition  data from a study involving repeat administration of genzyme s second generation adenovirus vector to the nasal epithelium of cf patients showed that  although the virus appeared safe  a complex immune response to the adenovirus was measured in almost all patients 
this and other data obtained in animals and submitted for publication in suggest that immune response may limit the efficacy of repeat dose therapy with adenovirus 
during the fourth quarter of  genzyme general received recombinant dna advisory committee rac approval and submitted a protocol to the fda for a two part safety study involving administration of its second generation adenovirus vector to the lungs of up to cf patients via bronchoscope and aerosol 
bronchoscopic administration commenced in the first quarter of  and aerosol administration commenced in september additionally  in september  genzyme switched to the use of a third generation adenovirus vector with an improved safety profile as part of this same study 
the study is currently ongoing 
in parallel with these clinical studies  genzyme general is conducting extensive research into proving the safety and efficacy of adenovirus 
particular emphasis is being placed on immunology  since it now appears that new vectors or methods need to be developed so as to reduce the patient s immune response and to increase the efficacy of adenovirus vectors 
such improvements may be necessary in order for adenovirus vectors to be clinically useful in chronic therapy 
non viral vectors 
in addition to pursuing adenovirus and other viral vectors  genzyme general is developing lipid dna complexes as vectors for gene therapy 
genzyme general believes that lipid based vectors may offer advantages due to their reduced immunogenicity and ease of manufacture relative to viral vectors 
genzyme general has synthesized  evaluated and filed patent applications on numerous new lipids 
several of these have shown significantly greater activity in vivo than commercially available lipids 
to augment its internal efforts  genzyme has entered into arrangements with third parties to gain access to non viral gene delivery technologies 
to date  the most significant such arrangement is an exclusive license agreement with vical  inc executed in october for vical s cytofectins for use as non viral gene delivery vectors for treating cf 
the plasmid expression system containing the dna also affects expression efficiency  and genzyme general has designed various new plasmid constructs to enhance expression 
although substantial progress has been made in both lipid and plasmid constructs  currently the optimal formulation of the best lipid dna complex is still less efficient than adenovirus as measured in single dose in vivo experiments 
in december  a genzyme general collaborator received rac approval for a cf nasal protocol utilizing a lipid dna complex containing dmrie  one of vical s proprietary cytofectins 
this study commenced in september and is currently ongoing 
in december  genzyme general also initiated a collaboration with a british academic group for purposes of further studying genzyme general s proprietary lipid dna complexes 
in december  genzyme general submitted an ind to the fda for a nasal study using a proprietary lipid dna complex developed by genzyme general 
the study was initiated in january by genzyme and its collaborators at the university of iowa and completed in the second quarter of the study entailed the administration of the lipid dna complex to one nostril of nine cf patients and administration of the dna plasmid alone to the patients other nostril as a control 
although the results showed that the lipid dna compound was well tolerated  they did not demonstrate the lipid dna compound to be superior to the plasmid dna in improving ion exchange across the cell membrane 
also in the second quarter of  genzyme general completed a safety study in which the lipid alone was delivered in aerosol form to the lungs of non cf volunteers 
the study showed that aerosolized delivery of the lipid to the lung was well tolerated 
based on these results  a pilot study involving aerosol administration of a lipid dna complex to the lungs of cf patients was initiated in the fourth quarter in the united kingdom 
this study is ongoing 
cancer 
there are currently several approaches that can be taken to treat cancer using gene therapy 
some of these approaches are limited by the inability of current gene delivery technology to affect every cell in a tissue 
to address these limitations  genzyme general has focused on two approaches that it believes may be effective with the current generation of gene delivery vehicles immunotherapy and cytotoxic or suicide genes 
genzyme general believes that combinatorial strategies employing two or more gene therapy approaches  or a gene therapy approach with traditional chemotherapeutic or radiological therapy  will be useful in treating aggressive forms of the disease  particularly metastatic cancer 
immunotherapy mart and gp for melanoma 
melanoma is a cancer of the skin affecting melanocytes  the normal cells that color the skin  and is commonly associated with overexposure to the sun 
melanoma is far more serious than other types of skin cancer  accounting for three quarters of all deaths from skin cancer despite representing only of all such cases 
the incidence of melanoma is increasing at a faster rate than that of any other type of cancer in the us over  new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed and more than  deaths from this disease are projected to occur in the us during worldwide  incidence of melanoma is estimated to be  new cases per year 
genzyme general s melanoma gene therapy program has centered on the delivery of the mart and gp genes to dendritic cells to elicit systemic anti melanoma t cell responses 
under a collaborative research and development agreement crada with the national cancer institute nci  genzyme general has constructed  in conjunction with dr 
steven rosenberg at the nci  adenoviral vectors incorporating the mart or gp tumor antigen genes 
in vitro studies have demonstrated that cells which do not express either tumor antigen become targets for destruction by antigen specific t cells following infection with an adenovirus incorporating the appropriate tumor antigen genes 
subsequent preclinical animal studies at the nci demonstrated that i prior immunization with an adenovirus incorporating the gp tumor antigen gene can provide protection against melanoma cells  ii adoptive transfer of spleen cells derived from animals immunized with the adenovirus carrying the gene incorporating gp can confer protection against melanoma tumor cells  suggesting that the virus is indeed able to elicit t cell response and iii immunization with the gp virus can dramatically reduce the number of lung metastases in a model of established melanoma particularly when co administered with interleukin  a t cell growth factor 
these promising preclinical results led to the initiation of two pilot clinical studies  designed by dr 
rosenberg and which are currently underway at the nci 
in these studies  adenovirus vectors carrying either the mart ad mart or gp ad gp gene are being evaluated for safety  immunologic reactivity and potential therapeutic effect when administered alone or in conjunction with recombinant interleukin patients in these studies have metastatic melanoma and have not received alternative therapies during the four weeks prior to administration 
preliminary results from these studies indicate that the adenoviral vectors are safe and well tolerated  and that a small but significant number of the patients immunized with ad mart have shown significant tumor regression following administration of the adenovirus 
clinical evaluation is in process to determine whether immunization with the adenoviral vector leads to the generation of an anti melanoma antigen specific cytotoxic t cell response 
data gathered from these studies should enable genzyme general to identify baseline clinical parameters that correlate with a favorable response to the vaccine and establish patient inclusion criteria for a phase ii clinical trial 
genzyme general has the option to license the mart and gp genes from the nci for use in adenoviral gene therapy for melanoma 
suicide gene therapy for liver cancer 
approximately  new cases of primary liver cancer are diagnosed in the us each year  and the disease accounts for approximately  deaths in the us annually 
the annual number of deaths worldwide from liver cancer is estimated to exceed  with the five year survival rate for localized liver cancer being only 
if detected at an early stage  surgical removal resection of the affected portion of the liver is possible  but diagnosis usually occurs too late for this treatment to be of benefit 
the median survival for patients with non resectable liver cancer is about six months 
genzyme general is collaborating with dr 
jack wands at massachusetts general hospital on the development of gene therapies to treat liver cancer 
dr 
wands has developed proprietary antibodies that can be utilized to target the delivery of a gene therapy vector to hepatocellular carcinoma hcc cells 
genzyme general and dr 
wards are also exploring the use of antibody targeted vectors to deliver suicide genes to hcc cells 
genzyme general has an option to license dr 
ward s technology for gene therapy of hcc 
gaucher disease 
genzyme general is collaborating with the university of pittsburgh and introgene  bv  in the development of a hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy for gaucher disease 
a pilot clinical study is in process at the university of pittsburgh to determine the safety of an ex vivo retroviral vector approach 
two patients have completed the treatment protocol to date 
both of the treated patients have detectable levels of circulating gcr enzyme activity 
the study is currently ongoing 
cardiovascular disease 
in december  genzyme general entered into collaborations with scientists at duke university and the university of california  san diego ucsd  to develop gene therapies for congestive heart failure  vein graft failure  and restenosis 
additionally  through its collaboration with ucsd  genzyme general will be developing a gene therapy application to protect heart tissue from oxygen damage that can occur during various types of cardiac procedures 
each collaboration calls for genzyme general to provide vectors and research funding to support pre clinical research by the academic collaborator and future clinical trials in exchange for rights to any products resulting from the collaboration 
other specialty therapeutics 
alpha 
gal 
genzyme general is developing a recombinant form of the human enzyme 
alpha 
galactosidase 
alpha 
gal as a treatment for fabry disease  a usually fatal inherited disorder of lipid metabolism estimated to afflict between  and  people worldwide 
fabry disease patients experience clinical symptoms which include pain  numbness  cardiac disease  cerebrovascular complications and deterioration of kidney function  death general occurs between and years of age 
there is no known treatment for the underlying disease and current medical practice involves pain management and kidney dialysis and or transplantation to reduce symptoms 
genzyme general believes that protein replacement therapy is a rational approach to the treatment of fabry disease 
to date  it has successfully produced the recombinant 
alpha 
gal enzyme in mammalian cells and has shown it can reduce lipid levels in the plasma and tissues of a fabry mouse model 
the development program is currently focused on producing sufficient quantities of enzyme for pilot clinical studies  which are expected to begin in late or early prolactin 
genzyme general is developing a recombinant form of the human hormone prolactin for use as an immune stimulant 
prolactin acts as a cytokine on a broad array of immune cell types including lymphocytes  macrophages  bone marrow and natural killer cells 
potential clinical applications include immunologic hematopoietic reconstitution for myelosuppressed and immunocompromised patient populations and as a vaccine adjuvant 
to date  genzyme general has demonstrated the utility of prolactin in several in vitro and in vivo models and has produced sufficient quantities of prolactin from mammalian cells to begin pilot clinical studies 
its development program is currently focused on initiating a phase i safety pharmacokinetic study in the second half of and identifying a lead clinical indication for evaluation in chitinase 
genzyme general is evaluating recombinant human chitinase as a therapeutic agent for treating systemic fungal infections 
these types of infections are often observed in immunosuppressed individuals such as patients with aids 
fungi contain the polysaccharide chitin as a component in their cell walls 
it is believed that chitinase  a chitin degrading enzyme produced by human macrophages  may normally play a role in fighting fungal infections 
it is believed that by augmenting chitinase levels systemically  it may be possible to significantly enhance the body s capacity to eliminate these type of microbial infections in immunosuppressed patients 
current therapies for fighting fungal infections such as amphotericin b are moderately effective but exhibit significant dose limiting toxicities 
the us market size for a new safe and effective anti fungal agent is estimated to be between million and million per year 
genzyme general has produced recombinant human chitinase in a mammalian expression system  purified significant quantities of the protein and is in the process of screening its antifungal activity in a number of different well characterized cell culture and animal model systems 
data from these studies are expected to be available in fourth quarter of surgical products the surgical products business unit develops  manufactures and markets four principal product lines the sepra products  cardiovascular fluid management systems chest drainage and autotransfusion systems  surgical closure systems sutures and needles and surgical instruments cardiovascular punches and other cardiovascular  plastic surgery  endoscopic and general instruments 
the fluid management  closure  and instrument product lines were acquired in through genzyme s acquisition of dsp 
dsp employs a person sales force  of which are located in the us  to market products directly to cardiac  general  gynecologic  colon and rectal surgeons and hospital purchasing departments throughout the us and europe 
genzyme general plans to increase the number of dsp sales representatives in the us to by the end of sepra products 
genzyme general is developing and selling the sepra products to be used during surgical procedures to limit the formation of postoperative adhesions 
adhesions are fibrous structures that connect tissues or organ surfaces that are not normally joined 
they are an undesirable side effect of the body s normal healing process following damage to tissue 
adhesions can cause significant complications such as bowel obstruction following abdominal surgery  infertility and pain following gynecological surgery and restricted limb motion following musculoskeletal surgery 
adhesions that form as a result of cardiac surgery can increase the complexity  duration and risk of subsequent cardiac surgery 
the sepra products portfolio is comprised of the following products seprafilm tm bioresorbable membrane is a solid formulation of modified ha and is used to separate and protect tissues and organs that have been damaged by surgery 
the membrane is designed to last several days in the body 
sepracoat tm coating solution is a liquid formulation of ha that  when used to coat tissues and organ surfaces at the start of and throughout surgical procedures  forms a temporary physical barrier that may protect tissues during surgery 
sepragel tm bioresorbable gel is a highly viscous gel form of modified ha and is intended to be used to separate and protect tissues and organs that have been damaged by surgery 
sepragel tm is intended to be used in laparoscopic procedures and on tissue surfaces that are inaccessible to seprafilm tm 
similar to seprafilm tm  the gel is designed to last several days in the body 
the programs to develop the sepra products achieved a number of significant milestones in during the third quarter of  the fda granted approval to market seprafilm tm in any open abdominal or pelvic surgery 
on behalf of the joint venture with gdp  genzyme general launched seprafilm tm broadly in the us during the fourth quarter through the dsp sales force 
the us sales force is focusing its efforts on the top  hospitals that perform of the targeted procedures for seprafilm tm and the chiefs of surgery at key institutions and the clinical investigator group and their associates who are familiar with the product 
genzyme general believes the market opportunity for seprafilm tm in the us comprises an estimated million surgeries annually million open abdominal and million open pelvic procedures that carry a risk of postoperative adhesion related complications 
at the end of february in the us  hospitals had purchased seprafilm tm  an increase of percent from the end of december  and the reorder rate for the product had increased to percent 
revenues from seprafilm tm sales during were not material 
in february  seprafilm tm was granted the approval of conformity certificate the ce mark in accordance with the european medical devices directive 
the ce mark signifies that a product meets quality standards necessary for marketing in the countries of the european union and the european economic area 
genzyme general launched seprafilm tm in europe during the second quarter of genzyme general believes the number of open abdominal and open pelvic procedures that carry a risk of postoperative adhesion related complications in europe is approximately million surgeries per year 
in february  genzyme signed an agreement with kaken pharmaceutical co  ltd 
kaken  tokyo  to market the sepra products in japan 
under the terms of this agreement  kaken was granted co marketing rights for seprafilm tm and sepracoat tm in japan in exchange for a distribution rights fee and milestone payments to genzyme 
kaken was also granted an option to acquire co marketing rights to sepragel tm in japan 
genzyme and kaken will share equally in the profits of all sepra products sold by kaken 
in january  genzyme filed a pma to market sepracoat tm for use in abdominal  pelvic and cardio thoracic surgical procedures 
in february  the fda notified genzyme that an advisory panel meeting will be held on may  to review the pma for sepracoat tm 
the advisory panel will make a recommendation to the fda regarding approval of the pma 
the panel s recommendation will be considered in the fda s final review of the pma  but is not binding on the fda 
sepracoat tm was also granted the ce mark in and genzyme general initiated marketing efforts for sepracoat tm in europe during the fourth quarter of sepracoat tm is being marketed in denmark  france  german  italy  the netherlands  sweden and the united kingdom as a complement to seprafilm tm 
during the third quarter  genzyme general received an ide from the fda for sepragel tm and commenced phase i ii studies of the product for use in abdominal and gynecological procedures 
a clinical trial for hal s tm synovial fluid replacement was completed in november hal s tm is a liquid formulation of ha intended to be used during arthroscopic surgery to maintain normal joint function and reduce pain and inflammation following surgery 
the study evaluated patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery for repair of meniscal tears  a type of knee damage 
the data from the study showed some improvement in the rehabilitation rate of patients that received hal s tm 
in light of the relatively modest improvement and small potential market size  however  further development of hal s tm has been suspended 
genzyme general believes that successful initial market penetration and subsequent maintenance of market share for seprafilm tm and sepracoat tm require a specialized hospital based sales force and has deployed the dsp sales force to accelerate the market introduction of these products in the us and europe 
substantial additional efforts to educate surgeons and hospital administrators as to the benefits of these products will be required  however  in order for the products to penetrate target markets and gain broad market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that genzyme general will be successful in its efforts to implement a commercialization strategy for the sepra products 
funding for the development of the sepra products has been provided by gdp  which has the exclusive right to commercialize these products in the us and canada through the joint venture 
gdp also has the right to a royalty on the genzyme general s european sales of these products under certain circumstances 
since the first quarter of  genzyme general has funded development of the sepra products on behalf of gdp on an annual basis and is continuing such funding during see related entities gdp 
cardiovascular fluid management systems 
this product line consists primarily of self contained  disposable chest drainage devices used to drain blood from the chest cavity following open heart surgery  other surgical procedures and trauma 
if the chest cavity is not properly drained  the patient may suffer collapsed lungs  which often results in death 
in  dsp introduced the first self contained  disposable chest drainage unit  pleur evac r  which quickly became the market leader in chest drainage devices  a position it still holds today 
dsp also sells autotransfusion devices that allow the collection of blood shed by the patient and its reinfusion postoperatively  thus eliminating the risks associated with blood transfusions 
in december  dsp acquired a line of dry suction controlled chest drainage and autotransfusion devices sold under the thora klex r brand name 
these products offer certain advantages over the existing systems sold by dsp and command higher per unit prices 
surgical closure systems 
surgical sutures  which are sold in packs consisting of suture needle combinations  are dsp s oldest product line 
dsp developed tevdek r surgical sutures in  the first coated dacron based suture  followed by silky polydek  a softer  easier to handle and tie suture 
dsp emphasizes high quality specialty sutures for cardiovascular and plastic surgery  utilizing special materials  advanced metallurgy and packaging innovations 
approximately of dsp s us sales are attributable to high margin specials in which individual surgeons order nonstandard products and customized suture needle combinations for specific procedures 
surgical instruments 
dsp sells cardiovascular punches  which are used during coronary artery bypass surgery to make cleanly cut holes  and hand held  reusable instruments such as needleholders  scissors  forceps  graspers  dissectors and retractors 
dsp s instruments are used in cardiovascular  plastic  endoscopic and general surgery and are sold directly to the surgeon  the key decision maker on purchases of specialty instruments 
in january  dsp launched a full line of instruments for use in endoscopic coronary artery bypass graft cabg procedures 
this new line is being marketed under the brand name endocabg tm system and was the first full line of instruments for this type of surgery approved by the fda 
the endocabg system includes both disposable and reusable instruments and includes the complete set of instruments required to perform cardiac bypass grafting endoscopically 
traditional cardiac surgery requires the surgeon to saw open the breastbone to gain access to the heart 
patients who undergo these procedures have severe scarring  an increased risk of infection  and long recovery periods following surgery 
the new field of minimally invasive cardiac surgery allows the surgeon to work on the heart through a relatively small incision without cutting the breastbone 
through the use of endoscopes and specially designed forceps  scissors  and retractors  the surgeon can perform the same procedure without exposing the patient to as much pain  trauma  and postoperative risk 
a less invasive alternative to open heart surgery  balloon angioplasty  was introduced in the s 
although this procedure offers patients less pain  trauma and a shorter recovery period  the disadvantage is that a high rate of arteries becoming blocked again so that patients often need repeat treatment  sometimes as soon as six months after the initial procedure 
about  single bypass and balloon angioplasty procedures are performed annually in the us by the year  dsp believes that at least half of these procedures could be replaced by minimally invasive cabg procedures in which the endocabg tm system could be used 
in conjunction with the introduction of the endocabg tm system  dsp entered into two agreements to expand the product line and to extend its use to other cardiac procedures 
under one agreement  the endocabg tm system will be expanded so that surgeons can stop the heart with the aid of an aortic occlusion balloon developed by the cook group of bloomington  indiana 
under this agreement  cook will manufacture the balloons and dsp will market them exclusively 
dsp expects to begin offering the balloons as part of the endocabg tm system in the first half of the other agreement covers a product development and marketing alliance with carbomedics  inc of austin  texas  a leading manufacturer of mechanical heart valves 
together  the companies are developing a system of instrumentation and supplies which will allow cardiac surgeons to introduce carbomedics s mechanical heart valves through a small incision in the patient s chest wall 
the companies expect to launch instruments for valve replacement procedures later this year 
during  dsp also signed agreements with leading endoscopic training centers in the us and europe 
both centers will use the endocabg tm system for minimally invasive cardiac surgery 
since september  the advanced laproscopic training center in atlanta has trained surgeons to perform the new minimally invasive cardiac surgery using dsp s endocabg tm system 
beginning in february  the european institute of telesurgery of strasbourg  france  has provided european surgeons with the same training offered in the us diagnostic services genzyme genetics applies advanced biotechnology to develop and provide high quality  sophisticated genetic diagnostic services to physicians  hospitals  universities  medical centers  clinical laboratories  genetic centers and managed care organizations in the us and internationally through a national network of laboratories 
testing services currently marketed by genzyme genetics include prenatal genetic diagnostic services  dna based diagnosis of a number of genetic diseases  including some cancers 
genzyme genetics also employs over board certified genetics professionals who interpret results and provide genetic counseling and support services to medical practitioners and their patients 
diagnostic services portfolio product program indication application status biochemical testing screening for certain fetal commercial chromosomal abnormalities service prenatal cytogenetics detection of fetal chromosomal commercial abnormalities service insight r molecular genetic testing rapid detection of selected fetal commercial chromosomal abnormalities service dna testing detection of single gene commercial disorders cf  fragile x  service huntington s disease  gaucher disease  etc

genzyme genetics offers three types of genetic diagnostic services biochemical testing  classical and molecular cytogenetic testing  and dna testing 
biochemical testing services consist primarily of a widely used screening test afp to determine if further prenatal genetic testing is appropriate 
classical and molecular cytogenetic testing involves the analysis of fetal cells obtained through amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling cvs to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities 
dna testing is performed to determine the likelihood that the subject has  or is a carrier for  a specific genetic disorder 
genzyme genetics s strategy is to expand its genetic diagnostics business by providing a comprehensive range of high quality testing services in a timely  accurate and convenient manner  by aggressively marketing its services through a direct sales force  and by maintaining an active research and development program that enables it to introduce additional testing services based on new technologies 
genzyme genetics also has an active program to expand its laboratory operations through acquisitions 
in furtherance of this strategy  genzyme genetics acquired genetrix  inc  a phoenix based network of prenatal and cancer genetic testing laboratories  in may the insight r test  a faster cytogenetic test based on in situ hybridization of chromosome specific dna probes  was introduced by genzyme genetics in this technology permits identification of the most frequently occurring chromosomal abnormalities within hours  as compared to the one to three weeks required to perform classical cytogenetic testing karyotyping 
the insight r analysis is provided in conjunction with a complete karyotype 
genzyme genetics s cancer diagnostic services based on cytogenetics and a series of supporting tests currently focus primarily on various forms of leukemias and lymphomas 
genzyme genetics also provides testing for numerous genetic diseases including  fragile x syndrome  spinal muscular atrophy  huntington s disease  polycystic kidney disease  sickle cell anemia  and hemophilia 
masda sm service 
accurate tests for detection of the genetic components of disease are likely to require the analysis of multiple genes as well as multiple mutations within these genes 
for example  defects in any one of at least four genes can result in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer  and in just two of those genes more than mutations have been reported 
there is  therefore  a crucial need for methods of rapidly detecting mutations in genes of known sequence 
to meet this need  genzyme genetics developed its patented multiplex allele specific diagnostic assay the masda sm service  which can analyze in a single assay up to samples simultaneously for over known mutations 
to use the masda sm service  a mixture of hundreds of probes is constructed with each probe specific to one mutation 
individual dna samples from numerous patients are then placed in a specific location in an array and exposed to the probe mixture 
patient samples that contain at least one mutation will be detected with a positive signal 
by identifying which probe s bind to the patient sample  the exact mutation s are revealed 
positive samples are also treated to produce a visual banding pattern that is unique for each mutation 
this pattern is automatically interpreted by computer analysis to provide results 
the masda sm service not only analyzes different patient samples with different disease indications in a single assay  it also identifies multiple mutations in one or more genes in a single patient s dna sample 
in addition  only those samples with a positive signal need to be tested further in the mutation identification step 
eliminating samples that lack mutations from further analysis produces considerable cost savings when compared to conventional testing methods in which each sample has to undergo extensive analysis before a negative report can be confirmed 
genzyme genetics is pursuing a number of commercialization strategies for the masda sm service 
in february  genzyme genetics launched a mutation cf test 
previous cf tests could only identify or fewer mutations  thereby producing negative results for people with rare mutations 
in addition  the masda sm service is also being used to provide genetic profiling services for clinical trials being conducted by pharmaceutical companies 
genzyme genetics has established a federally certified clinical trials laboratory to support diagnostic assay development using the masda sm service 
ongoing oncology studies in this laboratory include studies of colorectal cancer with kaiser permanente of northern california and the university of california  san francisco and of hereditary breast cancer with the dana farber cancer institute 
in addition  the laboratory provides population segmentation services for internal drug development programs and external customers 
these studies are designed to identify genetic markers that might provide information about the severity of a disease as well as the likelihood that a patient might respond either favorably or adversely to a therapy 
development programs 
genzyme genetics maintains an active program aimed at identifying and developing new technologies and methods of performing genetic tests and applying these methods to improve and expand its menu of testing services 
in its own research laboratories and in collaboration with others  genzyme genetics is developing additional platforms for complex mutational analysis and conducts major research and development programs in such areas as genomics and rare cell separation and analysis methods 
the masda sm service is designed to detect known mutations 
genzyme genetics is also developing related technology  called cleavage and ligation associated mutation specific sequencing or clamss  to detect and identify unknown mutations 
these techniques address situations where many different mutations in a gene give rise to a disease state  but where no single mutation is responsible for a significant percentage of disease 
in  genzyme genetics  together with its collaborators  announced the full identification of the pkd gene  which causes polycystic kidney disease  a common genetic disorder that leads to renal failure by middle age in most affected individuals 
this group is also involved in the discovery of the gene for the most common cause of inherited cardiac arrhythmia  long qt syndrome  also known as sudden death syndrome 
genzyme genetics also continues its efforts to develop methods and procedures to isolate and genetically analyze fetal cells obtained from maternal blood samples 
the program has demonstrated the feasibility of a separation technology involving the use of combinations of antibodies that bind selectively to specific cell types and has developed appropriate immobilization and analytical methods 
at this point  however  the process does not meet genzyme genetics consistency standards well enough to commercialize it as a diagnostic test 
fetal cells obtained from maternal blood serum could potentially be used in lieu of cells derived from amniotic fluid or chorionic villi for genetic testing  thereby avoiding the risk associated with amniocentesis or cvs 
genzyme genetics believes that successful development of techniques which permit prenatal genetic testing of samples obtained from mothers on a low risk basis  using rapid low cost detection methods  can result in a substantial expansion of the market for prenatal testing 
significant resources continue to be focused on this research program 
diagnostic products genzyme diagnostics is a primary supplier of diagnostic components enzymes  substrates  antibodies and antigens  bulk reagents and devices to manufacturers of clinical diagnostic reagents and kits as well as directly to clinical reference laboratories 
it also manufactures and sells a broad line of antibody and antigen based elisa test kits

genzyme diagnostics sells devices and reagents for the quantification of ldl and hdl cholesterol levels 
in october  genzyme diagnostics launched the n geneous hdl tm cholesterol test in the us the new test  which is being distributed by genzyme diagnostics under a worldwide agreement with the manufacturer of the test  daiichi pure chemicals co  ltd  of tokyo  measures how much high density lipoprotein cholesterol is present in a patient s serum 
because the n geneous hdl tm test can be conducted completely on an automated clinical chemistry analyzer  it is simpler than other hdl cholesterol tests currently on the market  which require manual pretreatment of patient samples 
the automation of hdl testing with the n geneous tm test will provide laboratories with significant operational benefits and enable them to improve results by reducing the probability of error introduced by sample handling and manual sample pretreatment 
genzyme diagnostics estimates the us market for the n geneous hdl tm test to be between and million tests per year and the global market at approximately million tests per year 
in addition to the us  genzyme diagnostics is the exclusive marketing partner for the n geneous hdl tm test in europe and the rest of the world  with the exception of asia  where genzyme holds co exclusive distribution rights 
genzyme diagnostics has also developed and commercialized an in vitro diagnostic test kit the direct ldl tm test kit for the direct measurement of ldl cholesterol in blood samples 
the correlation between elevated blood cholesterol levels and increased risk of coronary heart disease  one of the leading causes of death in the us  is well established 
a high level of ldl cholesterol in the blood indicates an increased risk of coronary heart disease 
prior to the approval of the direct ldl tm test kit  there was no routine direct standardized test for measuring ldl cholesterol and ldl cholesterol levels were derived using several indirect measurements and estimates  each contributing a potential source of error to the calculation 
genzyme diagnostics is working to replace the direct ldl tm test kit with a homogeneous method similar to hdl 
diagnostic intermediates 
genzyme diagnostics produces and sells critical components such as diagnostic enzymes  substrates and reagents for use in diagnostic kits used for blood analysis in clinical chemistry laboratories 
one primary area of emphasis is pancreatic function  where genzyme diagnostics provides enzymes  substrates  bulk reagents and patented methodologies for amylase and lipase determination to diagnostic kit manufacturers

in  melatonin  a synthetic human hormone present in a variety of foods and marketed as a dietary supplement  became the largest selling chemical product manufactured by genzyme pharmaceuticals 
genzyme pharmaceuticals supplies bulk quantities of melatonin to manufacturers of final dosage form product and is marketing its melapure tm brand melatonin outside the us in a finished dosage form product 
although total melatonin revenues in increased over  sales declined materially during the second half of due to declining market demand 
genzyme pharmaceuticals does not expect that melatonin sales will return to the levels experienced during the first half of during melatonin is regulated as a drug in many countries and  therefore  cannot be marketed without prior regulatory approval in those countries 
genzyme pharmaceuticals plans to start a clinical trial of melapure tm melatonin for a sleep disorder indication  which if successful will broaden the market opportunity for melapure tm as a regulated product 
clindamycin phosphate 
genzyme pharmaceuticals currently produces and sells clindamycin phosphate  an off patent antibiotic widely used by hospitals for the treatment of infections 
clindamycin phosphate is sold to pharmaceutical companies in the us  europe  japan and the middle east through genzyme pharmaceuticals worldwide sales organization 
hyaluronic acid 
genzyme pharmaceuticals currently produces and sells bulk hyaluronic acid ha for a number of applications 
under an agreement with alcon  genzyme pharmaceuticals supplies pharmaceutical grade ha powder to alcon for incorporation into provisc r  an ha based ophthalmic surgical aid product  which alcon introduced in genzyme pharmaceuticals also receives a royalty based on alcon s product sales 
hyaluronic acid is also sold to a number of customers for various research and development applications 
active drug substances and pharmaceutical intermediates 
genzyme pharmaceuticals currently produces drug substances for leading ethical pharmaceutical companies for formulation into a variety of dosage forms 
it also supplies various pharmaceutical intermediaries which are converted to active drug substances by the customer 
fine chemicals 
genzyme pharmaceuticals has developed a range of high value fine chemicals and chiral intermediates based on its proprietary technology in complex organic chemistry 
these products include various synthetic starting materials and liquid crystal chemicals for the electronics industry 
it markets these products through its own sales force directly to chemical and pharmaceutical companies worldwide 
synthetic phospholipids 
phospholipids are the major structural components of cell membranes 
they are useful in drug delivery systems  emulsion formulations and as components of pharmaceutical products such as liposomes 
genzyme pharmaceuticals has developed proprietary technology for the large scale manufacture of synthetic phospholipids with high purity and consistency and currently produces and sells synthetic phospholipids to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in the formulation and delivery of certain of their products 
synthetic peptides and amino acid derivatives 
synthetic peptides are a class of biologically active compounds comprised of chains of amino acids 
many of these compounds have applications as active drug compounds and are used by the pharmaceutical industry in final dosage form preparations 
genzyme pharmaceuticals is a commercial scale gmp manufacturer of synthetic peptides for many such applications 
amino acid derivatives are the materials used in the production of synthetic peptides 
in addition to producing these materials for use in its own peptide manufacturing processes  genzyme pharmaceuticals sells amino acid derivatives to the pharmaceutical industry for use in the manufacture of peptides 
competition genzyme general is engaged in a segment of the human health care products industry that is extremely competitive 
competitors in the us and elsewhere are numerous and include major pharmaceutical  chemical  surgical device and biotechnology companies  many of which have substantially greater resources than genzyme 
these companies may succeed in developing products that are more effective than any that have been or may be developed by genzyme general and may also prove to be more successful than genzyme general in producing and marketing their products 
each of genzyme general s business units faces different competitive challenges specialty therapeutics ceredase r enzyme and cerezyme r enzyme 
although genzyme general is not aware of any current effective alternative to its products for the treatment for gaucher disease ceredase r enzyme and cerezyme r enzyme  competition potentially could come from other protein replacement therapies or gene therapy 
genzyme general believes that its proprietary production techniques  exclusive raw material source for ceredase r enzyme and  to a certain extent  the orphan drug status of its products give it a number of advantages over potential competitors using protein replacement therapy for the treatment of gaucher disease 
gene therapy techniques are still in experimental stages 
genzyme general believes that the principal factors that will affect competition for ceredase r enzyme and cerezyme r enzyme will be clinical effectiveness and absence of adverse side effects 
one company is attempting to develop an alternative form of recombinant gcr by producing the enzyme in insect cells and modifying it by applying a coating of polyethylene glycol 
cf 
there are a number of organizations  both academic and commercial  engaged in developing therapies to treat either the symptoms of cf or the cause of the disease 
several groups are developing gene therapy approaches to the disease and also have received fda and rac approval to initiate limited human studies of cf gene therapy 
in addition  other organizations are investigating pharmacological and biological agents that would treat cf 
one such product  pulmozyme r  which was developed by genentech  inc  currently is on the market 
these groups may succeed in developing gene therapy products before genzyme general  in obtaining patent protection that may effectively block genzyme general from commercializing its gene therapy products or in developing other drug therapies that relieve the symptoms of cf and  thus  compete with products under development by genzyme general 
cancer 
competition in the field of cancer diagnostics and therapeutics is intense 
many competitors in this field have greater financial and human resources  more experience in research  preclinical and clinical development  superior expertise in obtaining regulatory approvals and more extensive production and marketing infrastructure than genzyme general 
genzyme general is aware of clinical trials sponsored by rhone poulenc rorer relating to gene therapy for cancer and expects that other large companies will be initiating gene therapy clinical trials in the near future 
genzyme general also relies on its collaborators for support in some of its cancer research and development programs and intends to rely on these partners for preclinical evaluation and clinical development of its potential products and services 
certain of its collaborators are conducting multiple product development programs in fields similar to those that are the subject of the partner s alliance with genzyme general 
for instance  the nci  with whom genzyme general is collaborating regarding the use of adenoviral vectors incorporating the mart and gp tumor antigen genes for the treatment of melanoma  is currently working with others on non adenoviral vector delivery systems for these antigens 
any product candidate of genzyme general  therefore  may be subject to competition with a potential product under development by a third party  including genzyme general s collaborators 
surgical products sepra products 
genzyme general believes that its expertise in developing proprietary fermentation processes and its access to proprietary strains of micro organisms used in its ha production process will give it a competitive advantage in the marketing of the sepra products 
its anti adhesion products may face significant competition  however  from other ha based products  from non ha based products and from changes in surgical techniques that would obviate the use of ha 
genzyme general believes that the principal factor that will affect competition in this area is acceptance of the product by surgeons  which depends  in large part  upon product performance  safety and price 
dsp 
dsp competes in three medical device categories cardiovascular fluid management systems  surgical closure systems and surgical instruments 
in each of these categories  dsp s principal methods of competing are continued innovative product development  the performance and breadth of its product lines  brand name recognition  sales force training and educational services  including sponsorship of training programs in advanced surgical techniques 
dsp s key product in the cardiovascular fluid management category is the pleur evac r chest drainage product 
dsp believes that it leads the chest drainage category with a majority share and that this position is sustainable due to a broad product line possessing patented features and brand name recognition 
the surgical closure category is dominated by ethicon  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  and sherwood  a division of american home products corporation 
dsp had focused on the cardiovascular suture market within this category and believes that favorable demographics such as the aging population and lengthening life expectancies will provide continued growth in this market 
competition within the surgical instruments category varies by segment  such as cardiovascular  endoscopic and plastic surgery instruments  with no one company dominating the entire category 
unique features and product innovation within its surgical instruments line  such as the recently launched endocabg tm system  have allowed dsp to compete effectively across this category and to hold a majority share of the cardiovascular punch segment 
diagnostic services 
the us market for prenatal cytogenetic and biochemical testing is divided among approximately laboratories  many of which offer both types of testing 
of this total group  less than laboratories market their services nationally 
genzyme genetics believes that the industry as a whole is still quite fragmented  with the top laboratories accounting for approximately of market revenues  and with no individual company  including genzyme genetics  accounting for more than of the total 
competitive factors in the genetic diagnostics services business generally include reputation of the laboratory  range of services offered  pricing  convenience of sample collection and pick up  quality of analysis and reporting and timeliness of delivery of completed reports 
genzyme genetics believes that its research and development program  which has enabled it to develop and introduce testing services based on new technology  and its active sales and marketing force have played significant roles in the rapid growth of its genetic diagnostics services business 
in addition to genzyme genetics  several companies and academic groups are attempting to develop fetal cell separation techniques 
genzyme genetics believes that its combination of separation and analytical technologies will give it a competitive advantage 
diagnostic products 
genzyme diagnostics acts as a primary supplier of enzymes and substrates  and generally does not compete with its customers in the sale of complete diagnostic kits 
this philosophy enables genzyme diagnostics to maintain unique relationships with major diagnostic kit manufacturers and to engage with them in development efforts to produce new or improved kits 
the market in the diagnostic products industry is mature and competition is based on price  reliability of supply and the purity and specific activity of products 
pharmaceuticals 
competition in the pharmaceuticals business is affected primarily by production efficiency  product quality and price 
genzyme pharmaceuticals believes that its success in this market is due to its technical expertise and selection of high value  small volume products that minimize direct competition with larger production operations in commodity products 
patents and proprietary technology genzyme general pursues a policy of obtaining patent protection both in the us and in selected foreign countries for subject matter considered patentable and important to its business 
in addition  a portion of genzyme s proprietary position is based upon patents that genzyme has licensed from others 
these license agreements generally require genzyme to pay royalties upon commercialization of products covered by the licensed technology 
in general  patents issued in the us are effective for a period of seventeen years from date of issue  although the gatt legislation changes this to twenty years from the filing date for applications filed after june  the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with applicable local law 
genzyme general also relies on trade secrets  proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in its product areas 
genzyme s employees  consultants and corporate partners who have access to its proprietary information have signed confidentiality agreements 
genzyme general s patent position and proprietary technology are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
see factors affecting future operating results uncertainty regarding patents and protection of proprietary technology under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation governmental regulation  in the us and other countries  is a significant factor in the production and marketing of many of genzyme general s products and in its ongoing research and development activities 
fda regulation 
in the us  products that do not achieve their principal intended purpose through chemical action within or on the body and which are not dependent upon being metabolized by the patient s body in order to be effective are classified by the fda as devices while other products are classified as drugs or biologics 
ceredase r enzyme and cerezyme r enzyme are regulated in the us as drugs  as are thyrogen r hormone  prolactin and chitinase 
its gene therapy products  
alpha 
gal and atiii are regulated as biologics 
the sepra products and dsp s products are regulated as devices 
the direct ldl tm and n geneous tm hdl cholesterol tests are classified as an in vitro diagnostic devices 
the activities required before drugs or biologics may be marketed in the us include i preclinical laboratory tests  in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies and formulation and stability studies  ii the submission to the fda and approval of an application for human clinical testing an ind  iii adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to prove the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic  iv the submission of a new drug application nda for a drug or a product license application pla for a biologic or a bla for biologics identified by the fda as specified biologics and v the approval by the fda of the nda  bla or pla 
in addition to product approval  the manufacturer of the product may have to obtain an establishment license for a biologic that is not considered well characterized or a pre approval good manufacturing practices gmp inspection for a drug or well characterized biologic from the fda 
since any license granted by the fda is both site and process specific  any material change by a company in the manufacturing process  equipment or location necessitates additional fda review and approval 
products that are classified as devices also require fda approval prior to marketing 
devices are classified as class i  ii or iii  depending upon the information available to assure their safety and effectiveness 
in general  class i and class ii devices are devices whose safety and effectiveness can reasonably be assured through general or specific controls  respectively 
class iii devices are life sustaining  life supporting or implantable devices or new devices which have been found not to be substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices 
the steps required for approval of a class iii device include i preclinical laboratory tests and in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies  ii the submission to the fda and approval of an investigational device exemption an ide to allow initiation of clinical testing  iii human clinical studies to prove safety and effectiveness of the device  iv the submission of a pma and v the approval by the fda of the pma 
typically  clinical testing of devices involves initial testing to evaluate safety and feasibility and expanded trials to collect sufficient data to prove safety and effectiveness 
in addition  the procedures and the facilities used to manufacture the device are subject to review and approval by the fda 
a device other than a class iii device which is proved to be substantially equivalent to a device marketed prior to may   when government regulations for devices were first introduced  can be marketed after approval of a k application rather than the filing of an ide and a pma 
the k application must contain a description of the device  its methods of manufacture and quality control procedures and the results of testing to demonstrate that the device is substantially equivalent to the device already marketed 
the time and expense required to perform the clinical testing necessary to obtain fda approval can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product 
even after initial fda approval has been obtained  further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted 
in addition  use of these products during testing and after marketing approval has been obtained could reveal side effects which  if serious  could delay  impede or prevent marketing approval  limit uses  force a recall of the product or expose genzyme general to product liability claims 
regulation outside the us 
for marketing outside the us  genzyme general is subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing and marketing approval for its products 
these requirements vary by jurisdiction  differ from those in the us and may necessitate additional pre clinical or clinical testing whether or not fda approval has been obtained 
generally  genzyme general s initial focus for obtaining marketing approval outside the us is europe 
european union eu directives regulations generally classify products either as medicinal products or devices 
for medicinal products  like those produced by genzyme  marketing approval may be sought using either the centralized procedure of the committee for proprietary medicine or products the cpmp or the decentralized mutual recognition process 
the cpmp centralized procedure results in a recommendation in all member states  while the eu multi state process involves country by country approval 
eu regulations for products classified as devices have been implemented for some devices 
devices such as genzyme s sepra products must receive market approval through a centralized procedure  where the device receives a ce mark allowing distribution to all member states of the european union 
for those devices where eu regulations have not been implemented  marketing approval must be obtained on a country by country basis 
the ce mark certification requires the company to receive international standards organization iso certification for each facility involved in the manufacture or distribution of the device 
this certification only comes after the development of an all inclusive quality system which is reviewed for compliance to international quality standards by a licensed notified body working within the eu 
after certification is received a product dossier is reviewed which attests to the product s compliance with eu directive eec for medical devices 
only after this point is a ce mark granted ceredase r enzyme has been registered for sale in the eu through a cpmp centralized procedure 
genzyme general expects cerezyme r enzyme  thyrogen r hormone  
alpha 
gal  prolactin  chitinase and the gene therapy products also will be regulated through centralized cpmp procedure 
seprafilm tm and sepracoat tm have been granted the ce mark 
genzyme will apply for a ce mark for all products sold by dsp 
orphan drug act 
the orphan drug act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than  persons in the us at the time of application for orphan drug designation 
the first developer to receive fda marketing approval for an orphan drug is entitled to a seven year exclusive marketing period in the us for that product 
however  a drug that is considered by the fda to be clinically superior to or different from another approved orphan drug  even though for the same indication  is not barred from sale in the us during the seven year exclusive marketing period 
genzyme general has been accorded orphan drug status for ceredase r enzyme and cerezyme r enzyme and has received orphan drug designation for a number of other products currently under development  including gene therapy products and thyrogen r hormone 
legislation has been periodically introduced in recent years  however  to amend the orphan drug act 
such legislation has generally been directed to shortening the period of automatic market exclusivity and granting certain marketing rights to simultaneous developers of a drug 
the effect on genzyme of any amendments ultimately adopted cannot be assessed at this time 
it believes that the commercial success of these products including ceredase r enzyme and cerezyme r enzyme will depend more significantly on the associated safety and efficacy profile and on the price relative to competitive or alternative treatments and other marketing characteristics of each product than on the exclusivity afforded by the orphan drug act 
additionally  these products may be protected by patents  exclusive raw material supply contracts and other means 
other government regulation 
genzyme general s operations are or may be subject to various laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory practices  the experimental use of animals and the purchase  storage  movement  import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents used in connection with its research work 
the extent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action cannot be predicted 
genzyme tissue repair overview genzyme tissue repair is a leading developer of biological products for the treatment of cartilage damage  severe burns  chronic skin ulcers  and neurodegenerative diseases 
genzyme tissue repair believes that strong capabilities in three groups of core technologies cell processing  therapeutic protein development and biomaterials engineering enhance its ability to successfully develop and market a portfolio of novel products and services for unmet medical needs in the field of tissue repair 
two services  the carticel r autologous chondrocyte service the carticel r service for repair of knee cartilage damage and the epicel sm service for permanent skin replacement for burn victims  and currently are on the market 
development programs to improve the performance and expand the applications of each of these services are ongoing 
in addition  genzyme tissue repair is developing recombinant human transforming growth factor beta tgf beta for the treatment of chronic skin ulcer 
genzyme tissue repair further expanded its product pipeline in through a joint venture with diacrin to develop and commercialize two cellular therapies neurodegenerative diseases neurocell tm pd for the treatment of parkinson s disease and neurocell tm hd for the treatment of huntington s disease 
these programs are in phase i clinical trials and involve implantation of porcine fetal cells to regenerate damaged brain tissue 
the joint venture combines diacrin s expertise in developing populations of tranplantable porcine fetal cells with genzyme tissue repair s expertise in cell based therapies 
genzyme tissue repair will provide of the first million in funding for these programs and by the joint venture 
cartilage repair the carticel sm service background and market opportunity 
once damaged  joint cartilage does not normally regenerate in the body 
in addition to causing pain and restricted mobility  chronic injuries to joint cartilage over time may lead to debilitating osteoarthritis and can severely hinder a person s normal activities and occupation 
many patients with joint cartilage damage undergo arthroscopic surgery to smooth the surface of the damaged area 
other surgical procedures  such as microfracture  drilling  and abrasion  allow bone marrow cells to infiltrate the defect  resulting in the formation of a fibrous cartilage tissue that is less durable and resilient than normal articular cartilage 
these procedures may provide symptomatic relief  but the benefit usually lasts only a few years  especially if the patient s pre injury activity level is maintained 
more severe and chronic forms of knee cartilage damage can lead to greater deterioration of the joint cartilage and may eventually lead to total knee joint replacements 
approximately  total knee replacement operations are performed annually at a cost of about  each 
the artificial joint generally lasts only to years and is considered a poor option for people under the age of description of the carticel r service 
the carticel r service employs a proprietary process to grow a patient s own cartilage cells for use in treating damaged knee cartilage 
the treatment  also called autologous chondrocyte implantation aci  was initially developed at the university of gotenburg and sahlgrenska university hospital  gotenburg  sweden  in an effort to provide a better therapy for people with joint cartilage damage 
the new treatment is used primarily in patients with cartilage damage to the femoral condyle  an area of the knee formed by the end of the thigh bone 
patients with this type of damage generally display symptoms which include locking  catching  localized pain  and swelling 
the carticel r service starts when an orthopedic surgeon provides genzyme tissue repair with a biopsy of healthy cartilage from the patient 
technicians at the company s cell processing facilities in cambridge and framingham  massachusetts  use proprietary methods to grow millions of new cells for that patient 
the cells are then delivered to the hospital  where the surgeon implants them into the defect using the aci procedure 
in this procedure  the physician removes damaged tissue and prepares the defect for introduction of the cultured cells 
a small piece of the periosteum  the membrane covering a bone  is taken from the patient s lower leg and sutured over the defect to hold the cells in place 
the cultured cells are then implanted under the periosteum in the defect  where they form a matrix that integrates with surrounding cartilage to fill the defect 
in addition to standardized cartilage cell processing  the carticel r service includes an integrated program of surgeon training and rigorous collection and analysis of outcomes data  which is aimed at providing broad surgeon access and achieving and maintaining high quality patient outcomes 
in order to gain access to the service  surgeons must complete comprehensive training in the aci procedure 
genzyme tissue repair s training programs include clinical  technical and practical orientation modules  providing a concentrated exposure to aci technology 
physician training consists of lectures  practice of the surgical technique and an orientation regarding reimbursement and billing procedures 
as of december   genzyme tissue repair had trained  surgeons in this program 
clinical results 
at a meeting of the american academy of orthopedic surgeons aaos  genzyme tissue repair s academic collaborator  lars peterson  md  md  of the university of gotenburg  reported results of a study of patients treated more than two years ago with aci 
the results showed that of those with a single defect on the femoral condyle had good to excellent results in a clinical assessment using five different rating scales 
the new data also support the addition of osteochondritis dissecans ocd as an indication for aci 
ocd is the separation of a fragment of cartilage and underlying bone from the articular surface 
of patients treated for this type of lesion  had good to excellent results 
good to excellent results were also reported in of patients who had concurrent repair of damage to their anterior cruciate ligament  in addition to treatment of a cartilage defect on the femoral condyle 
patients with lesions on the knee cap showed less improvement  however  as only of these patients had good to excellent results 
a retrospective analysis of the medical records of the patients in this study  using the five rating scales  revealed that their knees were  on average  in poor condition before treatment 
as part of the study  peterson and his colleagues took biopsies of the aci grafts from of the patients 
treatment failures were over represented among these biopsies  because patients with good clinical outcomes generally did not want to undergo the invasive biopsy collection procedure 
in a blinded fashion  an independent investigator examined the overall tissue appearance and cellular appearance and evaluated the biopsies using polarized light and immunohistochemical techniques 
the evaluation revealed that of the biopsies were composed of hyaline like cartilage the kind normally found on joint surfaces with a surface layer of fibrous cartilage the remnants of a tissue cap used to hold the autologous cells in place 
six biopsies were composed of combined hyaline and fibrous cartilage 
six were composed of fibrous cartilage 
correlation of the histological results with the clinical data showed that hyaline like repair tissue was associated with improved clinical outcomes  while fibrous repair tissue was associated with poor outcomes 
the results of this study confirmed those published two years ago in the new england journal of medicine  in which peterson reported on the first patients to undergo year follow up evaluations 
genzyme tissue repair believes that clinical data collection for analysis of surgical outcomes will be critical to document and expand the use of the carticel r service 
accordingly  genzyme tissue repair has established a registry of patients who receive cells from the carticel r service and requires that each surgeon obtain consent from the surgeon s institutional review board irb to collect outcomes data under a protocol developed by genzyme tissue repair 
data from the registry on patients who had been treated more than months prior to the time of data collection and patients who had been treated six months prior to data collection were presented at the aaos meeting held in february the registry data showed statistically significant improvement at both six months and months following aci treatment with cells grown by the carticel r service 
these improvements were seen in four key measures clinician and patient evaluations of overall knee condition  patient reports of symptoms  and knee examination results 
genzyme tissue repair is also planning a five year post marketing evaluation study that will compare the safety and effectiveness of the carticel r service to other treatment options available to repair damaged knee cartilage 
government regulation 
based on discussions with the center for devices and radiological health  genzyme tissue repair introduced the carticel r service in march as an unregulated device 
in the absence of specific regulation  genzyme tissue repair developed a comprehensive manufacturing process that established rigorous quality standards for autologous cell services 
these standards included internal and external assessments of the manufacturing and quality system 
this system was recently inspected by the fda in connection with the biologics license application submitted by genzyme tissue repair described below 
in april  the fda contacted genzyme tissue repair and asked for more information regarding the regulatory status of the carticel r service 
following this request  genzyme tissue repair filed a formal request in may of with the fda commissioner s office to review the regulatory status of the carticel r service and determine appropriate regulatory jurisdiction 
the fda was provided with information regarding genzyme tissue repair s quality standards and the policies that genzyme tissue repair established for the carticel r service  as well as answers to specific technical questions 
the fda responded to genzyme tissue repair s request for designation in july  confirming in its response genzyme tissue repair s belief that a formal regulatory framework appropriate to the carticel r service had not yet been established 
furthermore  the fda informed genzyme tissue repair that it intended to hold a public hearing to explore the public health impact of and consider appropriate regulatory controls for autologous cell implants 
the fda also informed genzyme tissue repair that it would not regulate the provision of the carticel r service or the epicel r service prior to the hearing and development of regulations  and would allow genzyme tissue repair sufficient time to comply with any new regulations that may be promulgated 
in november  the fda held a public hearing on the subject of autologous cells for structural purposes as a starting point for the development of new regulations 
genzyme tissue repair participated in this hearing  presenting information regarding the development  clinical application and processing related to the carticel r and epicel sm services 
genzyme tissue repair also advocated the development of appropriate regulations to guide further development of products and services in this area 
following a public comment period that closed in february  the fda announced that it would review its position and determine if regulations were required in the area of autologous cells for structural and reconstructive purposes 
in february  the fda issued regulations that will bring products and services such as the carticel r service under regulation by november of companies already marketing products and services subject to the regulations are allowed a transition period ending on november  in which to file and obtain approval of a biologics license application a bla or an ind  while continuing to market their products and services 
genzyme tissue repair submitted a bla for the carticel r service in march in anticipation of the regulations 
in march  an fda advisory panel determined by a vote of to zero  with one abstention  that the aci procedure using the carticel r service provided a clinical benefit to patients with damage to the articular cartilage in the knee 
the panel also made several recommendations concerning genzyme tissue repair s proposed post approval study of the carticel r service with regard to randomization and appropriate controls and endpoints 
the fda did not ask the panel to make and the panel did not make a recommendation concerning whether to approve the bla for the carticel r service 
the panel s recommendations will be considered in the fda s review of the bla  but are not binding on the fda 
although genzyme tissue repair expects the fda to complete its review of the bla before of the end of november  there can be no assurance that the review will be completed by then or that the fda will not require additional data concerning the safety and efficacy of the carticel r service 
a delay in the approval of the bla for the carticel r service beyond the transition period could materially and adversely affect the commercialization of the carticel r service 
sales and marketing 
genzyme tissue repair is making a substantial effort to establish the aci procedure using the carticel r service as the new standard of care for repair of cartilage damage to the femoral condyle 
as part of these efforts  genzyme tissue repair shifted its focus in to increasing the rate of reimbursement approvals by establishing an educational program third party payers 
as a result of this program  several payers have established protocols for selecting patients and determining eligibility 
genzyme tissue repair s reimbursement experience has demonstrated that payers with such protocols have higher approval rates and typically complete reviews in three to four days  compared to three to four months for payers without protocols 
in addition  one third of genzyme tissue repair s person us sales and reimbursement staff is involved directly in claims processing and educating insurers about the appropriate uses of the carticel r service 
genzyme tissue repair also believes that successful commercialization of the carticel r service is dependent on its being accepted by and incorporated into routine use by a large number of orthopedic surgeons 
genzyme tissue repair markets the carticel r service directly to orthopedic surgeons in the us and europe 
genzyme tissue repair s sales force promotes the carticel r service by contacting and educating orthopedic surgeons about the service and maintaining an ongoing relationship with each surgeon who receives training from genzyme tissue repair  assisting physicians with administrative  clinical and reimbursement issues involved in arranging to perform the biopsy and implantation procedures at hospitals  and assisting physicians in obtaining the necessary approval from the hospital s irb to collect outcomes data in accordance with genzyme tissue repair s protocol 
genzyme tissue repair further supports its sales and marketing efforts by attendance at and participation in orthopedic congresses and symposia 
development programs 
genzyme tissue repair currently has a number of ongoing development programs relating to the carticel r service  including work on arthroscopic implantation procedures and development of the carticel r service for other applications 
the primary objectives of these programs are to i improve genzyme tissue repair s general knowledge of cartilage repair  ii improve the regenerative ability of the implanted  autologous chondrocytes and iii expand the application of the carticel r service to the repair of large surface area defects 
neurodegenerative diseases diacrin genzyme llc 
in october  diacrin genzyme llc was established as a joint venture between genzyme tissue repair and diacrin to develop and commercialize two cellular therapies neurodegenerative diseases neurocell tm pd for the treatment of parkinson s disease and neurocell tm hd for the treatment of huntington s disease 
these programs are in phase i clinical trials and involve implantation of porcine fetal cells to regenerate damaged brain tissue 
with both products  rejection of the porcine cells can be prevented with the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin 
the joint venture also has a license to patented technology being developed at massachusetts general hospital  boston  which is designed to protect donor cells from the host s immune system without the need for immunosuppressive drugs 
in december  the fda granted orphan drug designation to neurocell tm pd for in advanced parkinson s patients and to neurocell tm hd for all huntington s patients 
each received the designation for use with an antibody pretreatment to prevent rejection 
genzyme tissue repair and diacrin estimate that the patient population with advanced parkinson s disease ranges from  to  in the united states and that the us patient population with huntington s disease is approximately  under the terms of the joint venture agreement  genzyme tissue repair will provide of the first million in funding for products to be developed by the joint venture 
thereafter  all costs will be shared equally between genzyme tissue repair and diacrin 
profits from the joint venture will be shared equally by the two parties 
in order to provide initial funding for diacrin genzyme llc  the genzyme board of directors the genzyme board has approved the allocation of up to million in cash from genzyme general to genzyme tissue repair the gtr equity line in exchange for an increase in the number of gtr designated shares at a rate determined by dividing the amount of cash so allocated by the average of the daily closing prices of one share of gtr stock for the consecutive trading days commencing on the th trading day prior to the date of allocation 
the company intends to make monthly allocations of cash under the gtr equity line in an amount corresponding to the funding commitment of genzyme tissue repair under the joint venture agreement for such month 
neurocell tm pd 
parkinson s disease is a degenerative disease characterized by the death of nerve cells in the area of the brain involved with smoothing and coordinating movement 
the loss of these nerve cells results in a variety of motor symptoms such as rigidity and slowed movements  tremors  falls  and difficulties with speech and swallowing 
therapy with the drug l dopa is initially effective  but begins to lose its efficacy in to years and provides little benefit in the late stages of the disease 
the resulting medical expenses  early retirement  and nursing home care are estimated to be billion a year 
neurocell tm pd is aimed at these late stage patients 
enrollment in a phase i study of patients conducted at lahey hitchcock clinic  burlington  massachusetts  and boston university medical center has been completed and all patients have been treated 
the initial results of the phase i trial are similar to those obtained in parkinson s patients treated with human fetal cells  some of whom showed marked improvement in symptoms and restored efficacy of l dopa 
commercialization of treatments using human fetal cells is not practical  because of supply constraints  ethical concerns  and inconsistent quality of the human cells 
based upon these results  the joint venture is seeking approval from the fda to start a pivotal phase ii iii trial in separately  a histological study published in the march issue of nature medicine showed that neurocell tm pd cells transplanted into one of the patients in the phase i trial survived for more than seven months and showed signs of reconnecting nerve tissue damaged by the disease 
the study marks the first documentation of survival of cells transplanted from another species into the human brain and of the appropriate growth of non human neurons for a potential therapeutic response 
the patient  a year old man  died suddenly of a pulmonary embolism 
an autopsy showed that his death was not related to treatment with neurocell pd 
neurocell tm hd 
huntington s disease is a fatal genetic disorder that is usually not evident until middle age 
it causes uncontrolled movements  gait and postural defects  and dementia 
approximately  americans are in the late stages of this disease  and an additional  are diagnosed each year 
neurocell hd is in a patient phase i clinical trial at lahey hitchcock clinic  boston university medical center  and brigham and women s hospital in boston 
all patients were treated as of the end of the first quarter of skin repair the epicel sm service 
each year approximately  people in the united states suffer burn injuries 
according to the national center for health services  approximately  of these patients are admitted to hospitals for serious burn injuries 
genzyme tissue repair estimates that approximately  of the most severely burned patients in the united states are admitted to one of the specialized burn centers 
industry analysts estimate that approximately billion is spent in the united states annually for the treatment of burns 
skin grafts produced using the epicel sm service are a life saving product indicated for patients who suffer severe  full thickness burns and need permanent skin replacement 
these epidermal grafts are grown from a patient s own skin cells and  therefore  are not rejected by the patient s immune system 
starting with a patient biopsy about the size of a postage stamp  genzyme tissue repair can grow enough skin grafts in three to four weeks to cover a patient s entire body surface area 
each skin graft consists of a sheet of cultured skin cells  approximately square centimeters in size and ranging from two to eight cell layers thick  attached to a piece of surgical dressing material 
a hour shelf life allows these grafts to be delivered anywhere in the us  europe or japan from genzyme tissue repair s production laboratories in cambridge  massachusetts 
skin grafts produced using the epicel sm service were first introduced in and remain the only commercially available laboratory grown skin grafts shown to provide permanent skin replacement 
most burn wounds involving less than body surface area are covered with conventional skin grafts within the three to four weeks it currently takes to grow skin grafts produced using the epicel sm service 
therefore  genzyme tissue repair believes that the primary candidates for the epicel sm service are the approximately four hundred patients each year in the us who survive burn injuries covering more than of their body surface area 
genzyme tissue repair markets the epicel sm service to burn centers throughout the us and in parts of europe through its own direct sales force 
genzyme tissue repair also markets the epicel sm service in japan through a distributor 
genzyme tissue repair is currently evaluating alternative approaches for use of the epicel sm service which will represent improvements over certain limitations that have been identified in its clinical utility and production methods 
methods being evaluated by genzyme tissue repair include use of synthetic membranes and composite skin grafts 
genzyme tissue repair believes that advances in the field of autologous keratinocyte grafting coupled with one or both of these technologies may allow the expanded use of autologous keratinocyte grafting for the treatment of smaller burns as well as for treatment of cutaneous ulcers which involve large surface areas of the skin 
in the latter case  genzyme tissue repair believes an improved autologous keratinocyte graft could effectively and economically provide final wound closure following effective debridement and induction of granulation tissue deposition at the wound site 
tgf beta chronic skin ulcers are open  often painful wounds found predominantly on the lower extremities of elderly patients 
genzyme tissue repair estimates that approximately  cases of chronic or slow healing skin ulcers are treated in the united states each year at a cost of more than billion  with individual treatments costing up to  per year 
tgf beta is one of a family of proteins that plays an important role in the body s ability to promote normal wound healing by stimulating the growth of connective tissue 
genzyme tissue repair has licensed recombinant tgf beta from celtrix pharmaceuticals  inc celtrix and is collaborating with celtrix on the use of tgf beta to promote the healing of chronic skin ulcers by supplementing the body s own production of tgf beta the product will consist of an easy to use collagen sponge which serves as a delivery vehicle permitting the release of a consistent dose of tgf beta to the wound surface over time 
in january  celtrix announced that the results of the phase ii study of the tgf beta wound healing product in the treatment of venous ulcers were consistent with previous findings which indicated a positive trend in wound healing 
these results also allowed celtrix to reach several important conclusions i topically applied tgf beta is safe at the doses tested  ii the delivery vehicle is well tolerated and iii the ease of treatment enables patients to apply tgf beta therapy themselves 
due to variability in patient response in placebo groups  however  combined with a greater than expected placebo effect  statistical significance was not achieved in this study 
in the fourth quarter of  genzyme tissue repair began a center  double blinded  randomized phase ii clinical trial 
the study groups diabetic patients suffering from neurotrophic diabetic foot ulcers into one of three tgf beta impregnated collagen sponge dose groups  a placebo group or a standard of care control group 
the study is currently ongoing 
during the first half of  genzyme tissue repair concentrated its efforts on refining the formulation and manufacturing process for the tgf beta collagen sponges at genzyme s allston  massachusetts facility for use in phase ii clinical trials 
genzyme successfully produced  sponges using bulk tgf beta from celtrix and collagen slurry from an outside source 
genzyme plans to manufacture tgf beta for phase iii clinical trials in its own facilities 
upon commercialization  genzyme tissue repair will make royalty payments to celtrix based on cumulative product sales 
genzyme tissue repair is also obligated to make milestone payments to celtrix for product development related achievements 
genzyme tissue repair is also developing recombinant tgf beta for formulation as an intravenous injectable product for administration to multiple sclerosis ms patients for the prevention of autoimmune damage of nerve tissue 
this program continues work begun by celtrix on tgf beta in people suffering from ms 
in april  celtrix initiated a phase i clinical study with recombinant tgf beta in individuals with ms 
the study is being conducted by the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke 
the initial clinical evaluation of tgf beta in patients with ms is an open label  ascending dose safety study involving patients with the progressive form of the disease 
genzyme tissue repair continues to conduct toxicity studies of tgf beta to support future phase ii clinical trials 
genzyme tissue repair has not committed to a development and commercialization strategy for tgf beta for ms and has begun exploratory discussions regarding the future grant of a license to a third party for this indication 
tgf beta has also been shown to promote wound healing in animal models of hard tissue repair 
genzyme tissue repair has been approached by a number of companies in the orthopedic implant market to evaluate the use of tgf beta in conjunction with accelerating the healing process in segmental defect repair and general use of implants 
genzyme tissue repair may grant a license for use of tgf beta for this indication to a third party 
genzyme tissue repair s rights with respect to tgf beta derive from a license and development agreement which genzyme and celtrix entered into in june the agreement provides for a collaboration between the parties to develop and commercialize tgf beta for any therapeutic uses for any clinical indication excluding soft tissue augmentation  vascular prostheses  and all ophthalmic and mucositis indications 
genzyme s rights and obligations under the agreement with celtrix have been allocated to genzyme tissue repair 
pursuant to the license agreement  genzyme tissue repair has worldwide commercialization rights  excluding asia  for all systemic indications and select other indications of tgf beta celtrix has retained the right to acquire rights to indications not pursued by genzyme tissue repair 
vianain r debriding product 
vianain r debriding product is a proprietary enzyme preparation designed to remove necrotic tissue from the wound site 
vianain r debriding product is formulated in a hydrophilic cream delivery vehicle so that it is highly viscous and easy to apply to and cleanse from the wound site 
since vianain r debriding product is designed to be applied at the bedside by a nurse or technician  genzyme tissue repair believes it may also be more cost effective to use than currently available debridement methods 
genzyme tissue repair intends to use the same proprietary preparation of vianain r debriding product to remove necrotic tissue from both burn and skin ulcers 
in october  genzyme tissue repair completed a phase ii clinical trial of vianain r debriding product in burn patients 
the results of this multi center study indicate that i vianain r debriding product is a safe and effective debriding agent  ii multiple applications of vianain r debriding product are required to effectively debride the burn wound  iii a significantly higher number of patients treated with vianain r debriding product achieved acceptable debridement of the wound compared to patients treated with the vehicle alone  iv there was insufficient information to determine if the use of vianain r debriding product can speed the determination of early burn depth  and v there was a trend toward decreased time to wound closure in the vianain r debriding product treatment group as compared to the control group  but this difference was not statistically significant 
a phase ii single center study evaluating the ability to transplant skin grafts to full thickness burn injuries directly following treatment with vianain r debriding product in ten patients was completed in may clinical results indicate that the use of vianain r debriding product does not yield an immediately graftable bed in full thickness burns 
it appears  however  to be an effective debulking agent 
phase i clinical studies for the vianain r debriding product for the treatment of chronic skin ulcers were completed in june a total of chronic ulcer patients venous  diabetic  pressure were treated 
preliminary results indicate that vianain r debriding product is a safe and effective debriding agent 
the product appears to be most effective in venous ulcers  six out of eight patients experienced at least debridement the remaining patients showed debridement and seven patients showed a significant increase in the amount of healthy granulation tissue present 
genzyme tissue repair has not committed to a development and commercialization strategy for vianain r debriding product for chronic skin ulcers and has begun exploratory discussions regarding the future grant of a license to a third party for this indication 
production genzyme tissue repair has developed and validated a commercial scale  proprietary chondrocyte processing system for the carticel r service 
a total of validation studies were conducted as part of this process 
in addition  genzyme tissue repair has developed hundreds of standard operating procedures to ensure the safety and quality of the carticel r service 
these procedures incorporate genzyme tissue repair s quality assurance program  consisting of facility controls  process controls and final product testing 
furthermore  each technician undergoes three months of training prior to handling patient cells 
all production and quality control procedures are intended to ensure traceability of operations 
these systems and procedures will require fda approval as part of the bla for the carticel r service 
see the carticel r service government regulation 
during  genzyme tissue repair s process development efforts are directed toward expanding autologous chondrocyte culture capacity  streamlining processing  improving quality at lower production costs and strengthening genzyme tissue repair s proprietary position 
this work includes improving yields  reducing labor associated with harvesting chondrocytes from cartilage biopsies  developing methods for extending the viability of both biopsy specimens and final product cell suspensions  and identifying cell culture systems that will enable genzyme tissue repair to automate much of the production process for the carticel r service 
genzyme tissue repair produces materials for its epicel sm service and carticel r service in a specialized facility designed for the production of cell based therapies 
during the second half of  genzyme tissue repair upgraded and increased the processing capacity of that plant for the carticel r service to approximately  patients per year 
in january  genzyme tissue repair acquired two adjacent buildings in framingham  massachusetts which it is developing as a carticel r service production facility with annual capacity of approximately  patients 
this project was completed in to avoid excess capacity due to manufacturing process improvements and a lower than expected rate of reimbursement approvals  however  one of the facilities acquired by genzyme tissue repair was reallocated to genzyme general in exchange for cash 
in addition  beginning in january  genzyme tissue repair leased approximately half of the second facility to genzyme general for a term of three years 
genzyme tissue repair expects that vianain r and tgf beta will be manufactured for genzyme tissue repair by the genzyme general on terms and conditions to be negotiated between the divisions 
competition genzyme tissue repair is engaged in a segment of the human health care products industry that is extremely competitive 
competitors in the us and elsewhere are numerous and include major pharmaceutical  chemical  surgical device and biotechnology companies  many of which have substantially greater resources than genzyme 
these companies may succeed in developing products and services that are more effective than any that have been or may be developed by genzyme tissue repair and may also prove to be more successful than genzyme tissue repair in producing and marketing their products and services 
each of genzyme tissue repair s products and services faces different competitive challenges the carticel r service 
genzyme tissue repair is aware of four companies  advanced tissue sciences  inc ats  in conjunction with smith and nephew plc  integra lifesciences corp 
integra  lifecell corp 
and verigen  inc that are engaged in research on cultured cartilage products 
epicel sm service 
genzyme tissue repair is the only commercial provider of cultured skin grafts that have been shown to provide permanent skin replacement for burn patients in the us however  genzyme tissue repair may face competition from companies using other approaches to culture skin tissue 
integra is marketing a collagen based dermal replacement product for severely burned patients 
this product will still require a skin graft from the patient or the epicel sm service to close a full thickness wound  however  and therefore will not compete directly with the epicel sm service 
ats also has received approval for a temporary wound covering for burns 
organogenesis  inc has submitted a pma for a product to be used for the closure of venous stasis ulcers 
lifecell corp 
currently has freeze dried enzymatically processed human cadaver dermis on the market 
tgf beta the use of growth factors is emerging as a treatment for partial thickness or very small full thickness wounds 
a number of companies are currently conducting or planning to conduct clinical trials with growth factors  although to date  no recombinant growth factor product has received fda approval 
potential competitors include chiron corp  in collaboration with the ethicon division of johnson johnson  curative technologies  inc  and scios novo  inc 
curative technologies  inc  also has one product on the market which does not require fda approval 
such growth factors may prove to be complementary to  as well as competitive with  tgf beta genzyme tissue repair does not believe  however  that growth factors can provide permanent skin replacement to compete with the epicel sm service 
additionally  tgf beta will compete with interferon based immunomodulators produced by chiron corp 
and biogen inc for the treatment of ms 
vianain r debriding product 
vianain r will compete primarily with surgical debridement of necrotic tissue or mechanical debridement using hydrotherepy and daily dressing changes to remove necrotic tissue and  to a lesser extent  with currently available enzymatic debridement products 
surgical and mechanical debridement procedures are painful  labor intensive and remove viable tissue along with necrotic tissue while the enzymatic debridement products on the market are slow acting and of limited efficacy 
enzymatic debridement products currently available commercially include products manufactured by knoll pharmaceuticals  parke davis  boots flinte  inc  lederle laboratories and rystan 
patents and proprietary rights genzyme tissue repair pursues a policy of obtaining patent protection both in the us and in selected foreign countries for subject matter considered patentable and important to its business 
in addition  a portion of genzyme tissue repair s proprietary position is based upon patents licensed by genzyme 
these license agreements generally require genzyme tissue repair to pay royalties upon commercialization of products covered by the licensed technology 
genzyme tissue repair s patent position and proprietary technology are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
see factors affecting future operating results uncertainty regarding patents and protection of proprietary technology under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
genzyme tissue repair received its first patent in october for its method of freezing cells 
in addition  genzyme tissue repair has filed and is preparing several patent applications covering its work in cartilage repair 
genzyme tissue repair possesses substantial know how in the field of autologous cell development generally  and for the carticel r service in particular 
such know how includes the production of biopsy kits and packaging materials  procedures for quality control  sterility  segregation and manufacturing  and product delivery  and the method by which genzyme tissue repair validates assays for future development 
genzyme tissue repair believes that this significant technological know how places it in a competitively advantageous position 
genzyme tissue repair s proprietary position in the culturing of epidermal tissues was originally exclusively licensed from harvard university and has been augmented by recently obtained additional patents covering cool storage technology and packaging of skin grafts produced using the epicel sm service 
genzyme tissue repair has also exclusively licensed  on a worldwide basis except for italy  recent patents covering cryopreservation of such skin grafts 
genzyme tissue repair has extended this basic cryopreservation technology by patenting additional developments and improvements in the us 
genzyme tissue repair also possesses know how relating to the large scale production of cultured epidermal grafts  the growth of other types of mammalian cells including fibroblasts and epithelial cells  and the formulation of various types of biomaterials  including ha 
in addition to ha know how  genzyme tissue repair has rights to a series of issued us patents in tissue repair covering modified forms of ha 
genzyme tissue repair has pending and issued patents in the us and other countries covering the enzymatic formulation of the vianain r debriding product and hydrophilic cream delivery vehicle for the product 
celtrix has obtained patents and filed patent applications in the us and foreign countries on the composition of tgf beta  its formulation and its therapeutic applications in wound healing  cancer  immune therapy and bone therapy 
genzyme allocated the rights under its license with celtrix to genzyme tissue repair at the time of genzyme tissue repair s creation in december while genzyme tissue repair seeks a strong patent position  it believes that its competitive position will also depend on its ability to maintain its trade secrets and proprietary know how  to achieve market leadership in key product areas and to obtain successful clinical results 
genzyme tissue repair s employees  advisors and consultants who have access to genzyme tissue repair proprietary information are required to sign confidentiality agreements 
government regulation material developments in respect of the regulation of the carticel r service are described under the caption the carticel r service government regulation 
a federal criminal statute that prohibits the transfer of any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation  but which permits recovery of reasonable costs associated with such activities  has not been applied to the carticel r service or epicel sm service 
certain states have laws requiring the licensure of tissue and organ banks and laws governing the sale of human organs and the safety and efficacy of drugs  devices and biologics  including skin  all of which could be interpreted to apply to genzyme tissue repair s production and distribution of cultured tissue products 
provisions in certain states statues prohibit the receipt of valuable consideration in connection with the sale of human tissue by a tissue bank but permit licensed tissue banks  including companies  to recover their reasonable costs associated with such sales 
federal or state regulation could result in significant expense to genzyme tissue repair  limit genzyme tissue repair s reimbursement for its services  and otherwise materially adversely affect genzyme tissue repair s results of operations 
autologous products are specifically exempt from the european device directive and pharmaceutical directive promulgated by the european union 
therefore  each european country is free to impose its own regulations on the marketing of such products 
to date  genzyme tissue repair has not encountered any local registration requirements for market introduction of the carticel r service 
genzyme tissue repair is currently assessing the regulatory requirements for commercialization of the carticel r service in japan 
the fda has issued draft regulatory guidelines to reduce the risk of contamination of xenotransplanted cellular products with infectious agents 
although genzyme tissue repair s management believes the processes used to produce the porcine cell products under development by the joint venture would comply with the guidelines as drafted  such guidelines may undergo substantial revision before definitive guidelines are issued by the fda 
there can be no assurance that definitive guidelines will be issued by the fda or that the processes used by the joint venture will comply with any guidelines that may be issued 
genzyme tissue repair is also subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous safety procedures used in connection with genzyme tissue repair s research work and production operations 
although genzyme tissue repair believes that its safety procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state and local regulations  the risk of contamination  injury or other accidental harm cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  genzyme tissue repair could be held liable for any damages that result and any liabilities could exceed genzyme tissue repair s resources
