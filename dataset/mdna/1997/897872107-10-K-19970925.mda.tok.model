for a more complete discussion  see accounting change 
the following table sets forth net sales and gross profit for fiscal and note  the net sales and gross profit for fiscal is on a pro forma basis assuming the new method had been applied retroactively in millions june  june  net sales retail distribution oem total net sales gross profit as compared to net sales of for fiscal under the previous accounting method 
net sales 
net sales were million for fiscal  a pro forma decrease of million  or  from fiscal international net sales represented of net sales for fiscal  compared to a pro forma for fiscal the decrease in total net sales from fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in sales to avid as discussed below 
net sales to the retail distribution channel were million during fiscal  a pro forma increase of million  or  from fiscal sales to the retail distribution channel for fiscal increased primarily due to the addition of the targa rtx and bravado product lines but sales were still adversely impacted during the first half of fiscal by delays in the availability of third party software applications 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company s software development partners made progress toward the completion of new applications for the company s high end targa rtx 
two such applications were released in january future sales could be adversely impacted if future third party software applications are not readily available 
the volume and timing of recognition of revenue from distributors and orders received from other direct customers during a quarter are difficult to forecast 
truevision s non oem customers generally do not place scheduled orders in advance and  as a result  backlog at the beginning of each quarter represents only a portion of the product sales anticipated in that quarter 
quarterly net sales and operating results therefore depend on the volume and timing of bookings received by the company and sales made by distributors during a quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
the absence of backlog has limited the company s ability to predict appropriate production and inventory levels  which has had and could have in the future an adverse effect on operating results 
truevision s results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to these and other factors  such as announcements by truevision  its competitors or the manufacturers of platforms with which truevision s products are used 
oem net sales were million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal the decrease in oem business in fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in sales to avid as discussed below 
during fiscal  the company entered into a three year oem agreement with avid under which avid had agreed to make minimum aggregate purchases of certain products of million during calendar years through in the fourth quarter of fiscal  avid and the company negotiated a fully paid license fee in the amount of million allowing avid to manufacture certain products used by avid  rather than purchase them from the company 
the company did not in fiscal and does not in the future expect to receive any revenues or royalties resulting from avid s manufacture and use of such products 
the company has no further obligations to avid 
for fiscal and  avid accounted for and pro forma  respectively  of the company s net sales 
oem net sales for fiscal and included million and million  respectively  of revenues from license fees under product license agreements including the million avid product license buyout in fiscal discussed above and engineering services revenue from a product design and development agreement 
gross profit 
the company had a gross profit of million  or of net sales  for fiscal compared to pro forma gross profit of million  or of net sales  during fiscal the company s gross margins decreased in fiscal primarily due to absorption of period costs ie  other cost of sales over a lower sales base  inventory valuation adjustments  and lower revenue from license fees and engineering services 
the gross profit for fiscal and included revenue from license fees and engineering services for the periods 
the revenue from license fees and engineering services for fiscal approximated the related costs 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses were for fiscal  compared to a pro forma for fiscal the decrease of million in fiscal was primarily due to a shift in resources to support engineering revenue as discussed above 
the company anticipates that as a result of the restructuring during the quarter ended june  see special charges fiscal below  absent any unusual circumstances or events  its relative spending levels of research and development expenses will be slightly lower in fiscal the company believes that continued investment in research and development is critical to its future growth and competitive position in its market for video products and is directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products 
the company  therefore  may incur increased research and development spending in future periods 
because of the inherent uncertainty of development projects  there can be no assurance that increased research and development efforts will result in successful product introductions or enable truevision to maintain or increase sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for fiscal  compared to a pro forma for fiscal the increase of million in fiscal was primarily due to start up costs associated with launching the new signature var sales channel  which is being used to market the targa rtx product line 
the company anticipates that as a result of the restructuring during the quarter ended june  see special charges fiscal below  absent any unusual circumstances or events  its relative spending levels of selling  general and administrative expenses will be lower in fiscal other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  for fiscal is comprised primarily of charges associated with the discontinuance of the initial development of a separate computer system product line and residual expenses associated with the rasterops product line 
other income expense  net  for fiscal is comprised primarily of residual expenses associated with the rasterops product line 
income taxes 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a provision for income taxes of million to fully reserve for deferred tax assets because management determined at that time that the future realization of these deferred tax assets was uncertain 
at june   the company had gross deferred tax assets of million relating primarily to net operating loss carryforwards 
these deferred tax assets have been fully reserved due to the uncertainty of future realization of the net operating loss carryforwards 
a provision for income taxes of  was recorded for fiscal  which represents federal and state alternative minimum taxes 
special charges fiscal during the quarter ended june   the company recorded a charge for restructuring and other costs of million 
this charge primarily consisted of costs associated with downsizing facilities and reduction in headcount 
also  as a result of the company s decision to close its european offices  the restructuring charge included costs associated with lease terminations and write off of fixed assets for the sales offices located in france and the united kingdom  and the write off of the cumulative translation adjustment 
the downsizing of facilities  lease terminations and fixed asset reductions is expected to decrease facilities expenses by approximately million in fiscal the reduction in headcount is expected to decrease employee costs by approximately million in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from fiscal international net sales represented of net sales for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the results for fiscal are comprised of net sales of million from the truevision product line and million from the rasterops product line 
this compares with million an increase of in fiscal compared with fiscal of truevision revenues and million of rasterops revenues in fiscal the product mix change was due to a shift in the company s product focus 
during the latter part of the first quarter of fiscal the company began to separate and analyze its product lines in terms of truevision and rasterops products 
the truevision product line consists of all video and oem products  while the rasterops product line consisted of macintosh and pc graphics acceleration cards and monitors 
at that time  the company elected to terminate its entire pc graphics product line  reduce its dependency upon monitor sales and focus on its higher margin truevision desktop digital video product line 
during fiscal the company exited the monitor and graphics product lines completely 
the following table compares truevision and rasterops product line net sales for fiscal and in millions  except ratio data year year product line sales sales change truevision retail distribution oem rasterops total net sales sales of the truevision product line to the retail distribution channel during fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or  for fiscal the increase in the retail business was attributable primarily to an increase in units sold of the targa product family 
during fiscal  the company negotiated a three year oem agreement with avid  which accounted for of net sales for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the company s agreement with avid provides avid the right to manufacture certain truevision products rather than purchasing them from the company and avid will be required to pay related royalties 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  avid exercised that right with respect to the current products of the company that are used by avid 
because avid and the company negotiated a fully paid license for avid to manufacture the current products used by avid  which are not the company s most advanced product offering  the company does not expect to receive any further revenues or royalties resulting from avid s manufacture and use of such products 
this will have a negative impact on the company s net sales in future periods 
oem net sales for fiscal and included million and million  respectively  of revenues from license fees under product license agreements including the million avid product license buyout in fiscal discussed above and engineering services revenue from a product design and development agreement 
gross profit 
the company had a gross profit of million  or of net sales  during fiscal compared to a gross profit of million  or of net sales  during fiscal the company s gross margins improved as the company shifted its focus to developing  manufacturing and selling more high margin desktop video products and at the same time exiting the low margin monitor business 
the company also realized cost reductions in its components costs in fiscal there can be no assurance that the cost of components will decrease further or even remain at the current level in the future or that the company will be able to improve or maintain its margins 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded additional inventory reserves of million excluding the million of included in restructuring costs to reduce inventory to its estimated net realizable value to reflect management s current plans and market expectations 
research and development expenses 
for fiscal and  research and development expenses were approximately of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal compared with for fiscal the decrease was primarily related to expenses in fiscal related to increased reserves for bad debts attributable to two of the company s foreign distributors  lease terminations  and legal fees  which did not recur in fiscal other income expense  net 
other expense for fiscal is comprised primarily of residual expenses associated with the old rasterops product line 
the majority of these expenses were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal income taxes 
a provision for income taxes of  was recorded for fiscal  which represents federal and state alternative minimum taxes 
no provision for income taxes was recorded for fiscal as the company incurred a net operating loss for the year 
at june   the company has a gross deferred tax asset aggregating million relating to the tax benefit for net operating loss and credit carryovers 
management believes that sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the reliability of the gross deferred tax asset that a valuation allowance of million was recorded 
the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent upon the company generating approximately million of future taxable income 
special charges fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a charge for restructuring and other costs of million resulting primarily from the company s decision to terminate the production of its entire pc graphics product line which consisted of a variety of graphics acceleration cards 
the company established a reserve in the amount of million to reduce the related inventory to net realizable value  and during fiscal the reserve was utilized  yielding no margin on sales of related products 
no material amounts of this inventory remained as of june  due to the discontinuance of these products  in fiscal the company recorded additional charges aggregating  for prepaid royalties no longer having economic value and cancellation charges on inventory purchase commitments 
also included in the restructuring charge were costs aggregating million associated with downsizing the company s worldwide operations  including lease termination for offices located in california  germany  france  the united kingdom and japan  and employee severance 
these lease terminations reduced facilities and amortization expenses by  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
the reserve for employee severance has been fully utilized 
the company had completed its restructuring activities and had no remaining restructuring reserve balance as of june  accounting change revenue from product sales to dealers  oems  vars and end users is recognized upon shipment 
in the quarter ended september   the company changed its accounting method for recognizing distributor revenue  whereby the company defers recognizing revenue  and does not relieve inventory on shipments to distributors  until shipment by the distributor 
previously  the company recognized revenue  after recording appropriate reserves for sales returns from distributors and allowances granted to them  at the time of shipment to the distributor 
distributor agreements allow certain rights of return and price protection on products held by distributors 
cash received in advance of recognizing distributor revenue is recorded as advances on inventory held by distributors 
the company believes that deferral of distributor sales and related gross margins until the product is shipped by the distributors results in a more meaningful measurement of operations and is a preferable method of accounting for distributor revenue 
the cumulative effect on prior years of changing the accounting method was million  or per share 
this amount was reflected in the quarter ended september  the estimated pro forma amounts for the year ended june  assuming the new method of accounting had been applied retroactively would be net sales of million and net income of million  or per share 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  a decrease of million from the million at june  working capital decreased to million at june  from million at june  although the company experienced a net loss of million in fiscal and a reduction in trade accounts payable of million  net cash used in operating activities was only million 
the net loss and reduction in trade accounts payable were partially offset primarily due to the non cash effect from the charge for the change in accounting method of million  depreciation and amortization of million  the charge for restructuring of million  the write off of deferred tax assets of million  and inventory valuation adjustments of million  and a reduction in inventory of million  a reduction in accounts receivable of million and an increase in accrued expenses of million 
during fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was million  primarily due to an increase of accounts receivable caused by increased net sales and timing of sales in the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal  and settlement related to a stockholder class action lawsuit 
in august  the company made a payment totaling million in settlement of the lawsuit  and the company s insurance carrier paid million  which the company had recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets at july   liquidating the july  stockholder litigation settlement accrual of million 
the company s products are sold to end users through dealers and other authorized resellers  regional  national and international distributors  mail order catalogs  oems and vars 
in fiscal  distributor revenue accounted for million  or of the company s net sales 
while the company intends to continue its policy of careful inventory and receivables management  it believes that in the future somewhat greater levels of inventory and receivables relative to sales may be needed to serve its distribution channels 
in august  the company entered into an agreement with a major supplier to purchase million of a certain component during fiscal and the component is used in the majority of the company s products and is currently available only from this supplier 
the supplier is discontinuing the component and the purchase commitment represents the company s anticipated usage requirements for the next two years 
the inability to obtain sufficient quantities of this key component as required  or to develop an alternative component  could result in delays or reductions in product shipments to the company s customers 
however  the company s future generation products  which are expected to be released within the next two years  will not require this component 
net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal and the company spent approximately million and million for new equipment during fiscal and  respectively 
additionally  the company acquired new equipment under capital leases totaling million in fiscal at june   the company had no material commitments for the purchase of capital equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was derived primarily from funds generated  from the issuance of common stock to investors  proceeds from stock options exercised  and borrowings on the company s line of credit 
in august  the company issued  shares of its common stock in a private placement to investors 
the proceeds were used primarily to fund the settlement of the company s stockholder class action lawsuit 
the company has a million revolving line of credit with a commercial bank that includes financial and other covenants that must be satisfied for borrowings to be permitted and that limits borrowing to percentages of accounts receivable and inventory 
the more significant financial covenants of the line of credit are quick ratio  tangible net worth  debt to tangible net worth and profitability covenants 
at june   the company was in violation of certain financial covenants 
however  a waiver of its covenant violations as of june  has been obtained from the bank 
although the company currently has a waiver of its covenant violations from the bank  there can be no assurance that waivers would be granted in the future if necessary 
if the company were unable to access the line of credit as required  its business  financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company s current line of credit expired on august  and the bank granted an extension through september  on september   the company entered into a new one year revolving line of credit agreement allowing the company to borrow up to million based upon percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the primary financial covenant of the new line of credit is a tangible net worth covenant 
as of june   the company had borrowings of million and million was available under the line of credit 
as of september   the company had borrowings of million and million was available under the new line of credit 
the amount available under the line of credit has been reduced by a letter of credit totaling  issued as a guarantee for a certain customer 
the company s cumulative operating losses in the current and prior years resulted in the need to address the company s liquidity position 
truevision s plans include cost reductions during the quarter ended june   the company undertook actions to reduce costs and expenses and recorded a charge for restructuring and other costs of million which included primarily costs associated with downsizing facilities and reduction in headcount  see special charges fiscal  and the introduction of new products during fiscal management has also developed production  sales and financing plans that they believe will result in significantly improved performance in fiscal including significant reductions in losses and or the achievement of profitable operations 
management believes that these plans  when coupled with available credit facilities as discussed above  will enable the company to continue as a going concern at least through june  the company believes that success in its industry requires substantial capital in order to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise 
the company may  from time to time  as market and business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies 
the company may require additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain these funds on terms and conditions acceptable to the company 
in addition  the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution in the equity ownership of the company s stockholders
