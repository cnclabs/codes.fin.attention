item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in particular 
as a result  the company s future operations involve a high degree of risk 
industry background data storage the company believes that the rapidly growing availability of huge amounts of data  and the need to readily access that data  has accelerated the demand for reliable and economical data storage capabilities 
the expanding role of networks  access to data from the internet  and the explosion of graphics and imaging applications require ever greater data storage capabilities 
with the loss of information being potentially devastating  participants in data dependent businesses have determined that it has become essential to have an automated system for data backup  archival storage and retrieval 
the adl line of automated tape libraries is designed to meet this requirement 
libraries can differ substantially in features  capacity and price 
the adl libraries target the low end to mid range of the market for libraries 
the company believes that the unique architecture of its libraries provides a competitive advantage in reliability and functionality 
the company plans to leverage these competitive advantages to continue to build its position in the low end to mid range of the rapidly growing data storage market 
competition in the data storage market  including the automated tape library market  is intense  with a large number of companies in these markets 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than the company 
an increase in competition could result in price reductions and loss of market share 
such competition and any resulting reduction in gross margins could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
certification  test and duplication the sale of certification equipment to manufacturers of floppy disks has historically been the source of the majority of the company s revenue 
manufacturers typically certify disks to establish quality levels 
disks are sorted into one of three categories based on quality standards established by the american national standards institute ansi category exceeds ansi standards  category meets ansi standards  and category does not meet ansi standards 
the highest grade disks are typically used by software publishers and duplicators  while the lesser quality disks are generally sold at retail 
during the early s  significant disk production capacity was added throughout the world  particularly in the lower labor rate markets of southeast asia and china 
the capacity added during the early s has been substantially sufficient to meet requirements 
this  along with the fact that price competition among disk manufacturers has driven prices down  substantially reducing margins  has minimized purchases of additional equipment by existing manufacturers and discouraged new manufacturers 
also  some disk manufacturers have discontinued the certification process  choosing instead to sell their disks as low quality into the retail market 
demand for disks has been restricted by alternative forms of computer media which have become available 
cd rom has gained general acceptance as more personal computers are equipped with cd rom drives 
many software programs and games which once were delivered on multiple floppy disks now come on a single cd rom 
other computer media currently available include floptical disk  which combines optical tracking and magnetic storage  the mini disk  a two inch disk offered by sony corporation  the flash memory card or pcmcia card  and higher density floppy disks with dramatically increased storage capabilities 
all these media require specialized drives for their operation 
removable hard drives with large storage capacity are also available 
although  the company believes that the widespread acceptance of the inch disk as the standard form of computer media in the industry will ensure its continued use for at least several years  the company expects the market for certification equipment to continue to decline 
the market for test and evaluation equipment for magnetic tape is primarily manufacturers of tape and their major customers 
the company believes that it is a leading supplier of such equipment 
the company works closely with the tape manufacturers to develop evaluation capabilities as new types of tapes are introduced to the market 
while there are several major companies leading the market for duplication of floppy disks  there are hundreds of smaller companies which have more limited duplication requirements 
the company provides a solution to the major duplicators with its accucopy line of industrial duplicators which incorporate the company s accucopy industrial drives 
the company also provides a single spindle duplicator to those customers whose requirements are less 
business strategy the company s business strategy is to devote the substantial majority of its resources to the development  marketing and sale of its line of adl automated tape libraries 
the company will continue to support its historical product lines of certifiers  evaluators and duplicators and will continue to pursue all sales opportunities for new equipment  spare parts and service that become available 
automated tape libraries going forward  all research and development activities will be conducted and overseen by the company s engineering department which was established and staffed in fiscal the establishment of an in house research and development capability has enabled the company to reduce its reliance on outside engineering consultants  giving the company more immediate control over the direction  cost  and schedule of product design activities 
the company believes that the most effective allocation of its resources requires that the manufacture of the automated tape libraries be done by a third party 
a strategic alliance has been formed with a third party manufacturer for the production of the adl libraries 
pagg corporation  an iso certified manufacturer located in milford  massachusetts  is currently manufacturing automated tape libraries for the company 
the company continues to develop a sales staff dedicated to the adl product line 
the staff will have responsibility only for the company s adl line of automated tape libraries 
in order to gain the greatest market exposure and penetration in the shortest amount of time  the company is focusing its sales efforts on value added resellers vars  original equipment manufacturers oems and large end users 
certifiers  evaluators and duplicators opportunities for sales are limited in the company s traditional markets 
there is significant competition for each sales opportunity  leading to severe pricing pressures 
the company believes it is a leading manufacturer of certification equipment by virtue of its proven technology and widespread acceptance of its products and is therefore well positioned to compete for available business 
the company believes it is similarly well situated in the market for tape testing equipment 
the company has gained market share in the duplication market and continues to refine its product offerings to meet customer requirements 
the company will continue to support owners of its equipment with spare parts and service 
products automated tape libraries the adl line of automated tape libraries includes libraries based on mm tape technology and mm tape technology 
the company expects to introduce a library based on dlt tape technology during each library developed by adl capitalizes on the design of its predecessor libraries  shortening the development cycle and increasing reliability 
the company believes that adl s scaleable library architecture sla includes radical design innovations for automated tape libraries compared with competitive products 
potential customers for the adl line of automated tape libraries are data dependent companies in all types of businesses 
in fiscal  the company sold only pre production units  and began delivering initial production units in fiscal features of adl automated tape libraries include independent loading mechanisms which can operate with each tape drive simultaneously  eliminating the need for robotic mechanisms and providing critical redundancy to ensure data security and availability 
a hot swap feature that allows the user to service and add drives to an adl library without shutting it down  resulting in nearly up time and uninterrupted data availability 
mixed media interchange capability allowing the user to access through the library data held on media other than those incorporated in the library 
for example  the user could store or retrieve data from such media as cd rom  qic tape  mm tape or floppy disk through an mm library 
scalability of drives  user options and datapaks for customizing and or upgrading adl libraries 
expandability for future applications 
mm libraries can be configured with from one to six tape drives and with datapaks holding up to cartridges  with storage capacity of up to terabyte tb 
mm libraries can be configured with from one to six tape drives and with datapaks holding up to cartridges  with storage capacity of up to tb 
the company expects that the dlt library it plans to introduce during will be configured with up to five tape drives and with datapaks holding up to cartridges  with storage capacity of up to tb 
in fiscal  the company sold only pre production units  and began delivering initial production units in fiscal the computer industry in general  and the markets for the company s automated tape library products in particular  are characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent new product introductions  and significant competition 
in order to keep pace with this rapidly changing market environment  the company must continually develop and incorporate into its products new technological advances and features desired by the marketplace at acceptable prices 
the successful development and commercialization of new products involves many risks  including the identification of new product opportunities  timely completion of the development process  the control and recoupment of development and production costs and acceptance by customers of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products in a timely and cost effective manner  that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products or technologies uncompetitive  or that the company s products will be accepted in the marketplace 
disk certifiers media logic manufactures semi automatic and automatic disk certifiers used by computer disk manufacturers to test each disk as it comes off a production line 
the certifiers are designed to run hours a day  seven days a week 
certifiers perform a series of tests on each disk  sorting newly manufactured disks into one of the three categories based on quality standards established by the ansi

this desktop unit sells in the price range of  to  duplicators the company manufactures and sells a line of accucopy duplicators incorporating the company s proprietary accucopy industrial disk drive 
principal customers for accucopy duplicators include disk manufacturers  who are increasingly providing disk formatting and duplication services to maximize the prices they can charge for their disks  and major software duplicators 
the company sells both three and six spindle versions of the accucopy duplicator at prices ranging from  to  the company also sells the spectrum line of single spindle duplicators 
this product is designed for those customers whose duplication needs are relatively modest or who do not require the industrial quality of the accucopy series of duplicators 
the spectrum duplicators are priced in the range of  per spindle 
sales and marketing automated tape libraries the company sells its automated tape libraries through multiple channels including value added resellers vars  original equipment manufacturers oems  and end users 
a dedicated sales force was established in fiscal with the addition of a vice president of sales 
the company is currently in the process of establishing and staffing several regional sales offices 
certifiers  evaluators and duplicators currently all the company s sales are generated by the company s internal sales group  located at its home office in plainville  massachusetts 
the company provides technical support services to customers throughout the world from its headquarters in plainville  massachusetts 
field service personnel staff a technical hotline and coordinate service requirements 
in addition  repair and refurbishment services are provided through the field service department 
approximately of the company s fiscal sales were to customers located outside the united states and  therefore  the company is subject to risks common to foreign activities including government regulations  political and economic instabilities  trade barriers and transaction risks 
substantially all of the company s sales are transacted in us dollars eliminating significant currency risk to the company 
in many cases  international shipments are covered by letters of credit 
in fiscal  four individual customers each accounted for or more of the company s sales 
because of the non recurring nature of the company s largest orders  the identity of its major customers changes from year to year 
therefore  the company does not believe that it is dependent on sales to only one customer 
backlog at may   the company s backlog was approximately  compared to approximately  at june  all of the orders included in the company s backlog were requested to be filled and completed within six months and are  subject to possible customer cancellation  expected to be filled in that time frame 
the company does not believe its backlog is an accurate prediction of its annual or quarterly revenues 
patents prior to fiscal year  the company relied upon know how rather than patents to develop and maintain its competitive position with respect to its historical product lines 
with respect to its certifiers  evaluators and duplicators  the company believes that a variety of factors including its products  design and applications experience  and its reputation are sufficient to protect its interests in these markets 
the company recognizes the value of patents in designs and processes and holds the rights under several patent applications covering the underlying technology of its automated tape libraries 
the company expects to seek additional patents as technological advances require 
the company also protects its technology and proprietary information through trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks and licenses 
the company s ability to compete effectively with other companies will depend  in part  on the ability of the company to maintain the proprietary nature of its technology 
there can be no assurance that competitors in both the united states and foreign counties  many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  do not have or will not obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with the company s ability to make and sell its products or intentionally infringe the company s patents 
while the company possesses or licenses certain patent rights  it relies in large part on unpatented proprietary technology  and there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop the same or similar technology  whether or not patented  or otherwise obtain access to the company s proprietary technology 
research and product development the company has focused its research and development efforts on the adl line of automated tape libraries 
expenditures for research and development of this product line in fiscal were  compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  the company continued to expand an in house engineering department established during fiscal which will be responsible for all future research and development activities 
a substantial portion of the research and development expenditures in fiscal and were made pursuant to a contract with an engineering consulting firm which expired during fiscal and was not renewed 
all work product generated pursuant to the contract is the property of the company 
the company spent  on research and development activities related to the certification  evaluation and duplication products in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal as of march   the company employed engineers  designers and technicians  including software  mechanical and electrical engineers  all of whom were assigned to automated tape libraries 
the company expects to add engineers to its staff during fiscal as it continues to undertake research and development activities which had previously been conducted by consultants 
the company continues to seek out new products and new applications for its current products 
manufacturing the company s adl line of automated tape libraries is manufactured by pagg manufacturing company of milford  massachusetts 
the company believes that pagg has the technical and manufacturing experience and capacity to meet the company s requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company believes that there are many manufacturers qualified to build the adl line of automated tape libraries should the company seek alternative manufacturing sources 
all of the company s certifiers  evaluators and duplicators are manufactured at the company s plainville  massachusetts facility 
the company s manufacturing activities consist of subassembly  final assembly and testing along with software development 
virtually all of the company s printed circuit boards are manufactured by third parties in the united states 
the company believes that it is advantageous to have multiple sources available for printed circuit boards  fabricated parts and other essential components and generally attempts to locate more than one qualified vendor for the manufacture of each fabricated part used in the production of company products 
competition each of the markets in which the company participates is highly competitive 
in each market some of the company s current and prospective competitors have greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which are being developed by the company and which could render certain of the company s technology obsolete 
numerous companies are engaged in the development and commercialization of automated tape libraries 
several manufacturers of tape storage systems have introduced libraries incorporating their tape drives 
these companies include ibm  hewlett packard  exabyte and quantum corporation 
the company does not own proprietary tape drive technology and is therefore dependent on third party manufacturers of storage devices for incorporation of its libraries 
other competitors in the automated tape library market include odetics  qualstar  spectra logic and adic

prior to fiscal  the company was principally engaged in the development  manufacture and sale of test equipment for computer media  primarily floppy disks and tape 
beginning in fiscal  the company developed and brought to market a heavy duty industrial disk drive and floppy disk duplication equipment which incorporated the drives 
together  these products constituted what is now considered to be the company s traditional business 
the market for these traditional products has been negatively impacted in recent years by a number of factors including but not limited to competition among disk manufacturers  the principal customer for the company s certification equipment  which led to lower disk prices 
manufacturers had less money to spend on additional capital equipment and the low margins made the business unattractive to potential new entrants  the wide spread acceptance of cd rom as an effective medium for the delivery of software negatively impacted the demand for higher quality disks  the closing of the chinese market  eliminating the company s largest market for new equipment and providing a source of used equipment to be sold in non chinese markets in competition with the company s new equipment 
the company recognized the declining nature of its traditional markets and in fiscal established a subsidiary company  medialogic adl  inc adl  to develop  market and sell automated tape libraries into the data storage market 
the company believes that the market for automated tape libraries is large and growing and that the line of libraries which has been developed by the company meets the data storage and retrieval requirements of a large range of customers 
the substantial majority of the company s resources are now  and will continue to be  devoted to the development and marketing of this product line 
the company first commenced sales of its initial production units of adl products  other than evaluation units  in fiscal year and therefore has limited experience in selling its adl products 
while  in fiscal year the company still derived most of its revenues from sales of its certifiers  evaluators and duplicators for floppy disks and tape  the company has shifted its focus to its automated tape libraries for the data storage market 
the company expects to derive a substantial majority of its total revenue and net income from sales of its adl products in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the indicated periods  certain data as percentages of the company s net sales year ended march  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses income loss from operations settlement costs other income income loss before taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss twelve months ended march  compared to twelve months ended march  sales for the twelve month period ended march  increased by compared to fiscal which had decreased by compared to fiscal this stabilization of revenue is primarily the result of steady demand for the company s traditional product line 
previously  severe pricing pressures in the sale of floppy disks  discouraging current manufacturers from adding capacity and creating barriers to new entrants into the market  led to dramatic decreases in revenue 
a significant number of manufacturers of floppy disks went out of business  particularly in china  flooding the market with used equipment 
this led to increased competition for the limited opportunities available and lower prices for equipment 
sales of the adl line of automated libraries were not significant in fiscal the company expects sales of this product line to be an increased portion of the company s revenues in fiscal international revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the company is continuing to pursue opportunities in sections of the world which have not previously been served by disk manufacturers 
the following table summarizes sales by geographic region sales by geographic region fiscal fiscal fiscal domestic    europe    far east    other    total costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the principal reasons for the decrease in fiscal were the expansion of the development of an in house engineering capability to replace outside consultants and the institution of strict controls on all aspects of the company s business

twelve months ended march  compared to twelve months ended march  sales for the twelve month period ended march  decreased by compared to fiscal which had decreased by compared to fiscal this steady decline in revenue is primarily the result of severe pricing pressures in the sale of floppy disks  discouraging current manufacturers from adding capacity and creating barriers to new entrants into the market 
additionally  a significant number of manufacturers of floppy disks have gone out of business  particularly in china  flooding the market with used equipment 
this has led to increased competition for the limited opportunities available and lower prices for equipment 
revenues by product are summarized in the following table 
fiscal fiscal fiscal certifiers    disk evaluators    tape evaluators    accucopy    spares    revenue from the sale of certifiers accounted for of the company s revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal this is reflective of the fact that disk manufacturers are not adding manufacturing capacity and therefore do not require additional certifiers 
sales of new certifiers are also adversely affected by the availability of used certifiers 
the company believes that it continues to be a leading manufacturer of disk certification equipment and that it is well positioned to secure what opportunities become available 
however  the company does not expect the market for disk certification equipment to increase substantially in fiscal  and the company furthermore expects to continue to encounter severe competition for those opportunities which arise 
revenue from disk evaluators represents of the company s revenue in fiscal compared to of sales in fiscal and of sales in fiscal as with certifiers  sales of disk evaluators  which are used primarily by disk manufacturers to test the quality of disks from their production  are directly related to the addition of manufacturing capacity 
revenue from tape evaluators decreased to of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the company believes that fiscal sales were higher because of the introduction of the b tape evaluator during that fiscal year and that fiscal sales are representative of the market for the company s tape evaluator products 
accucopy drives and duplicators represent of fiscal revenues as compared to of fiscal revenues and of fiscal revenues 
the increase is primarily in the sale of duplicators which incorporate accucopy drives as the company has established itself as a viable supplier to the duplication market 
customer service and spares business accounted for of the company s sales in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal this represents an increase of in actual revenues for service and spares  despite a significant reduction in new system sales 
the company has emphasized the sale of service and spare parts to take advantage of its installed base and to offset a portion of the shortfall in new system sales 
sales of the adl line of automated libraries constituted less than one percent of total sales in fiscal the company expects sales of this product line to be a substantial portion of the company s revenues in fiscal international revenues decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal sales fell in all geographic regions  reflecting general industry conditions
