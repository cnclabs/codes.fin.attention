item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of and the company intends that such forward looking statements are subject to the safe harbors created thereby 
see introductory note page hereof and certain considerations on page hereof 
the company had net sales of  in   in and  in management believes that the increase in sales is due to an expanded customer base resulting from an increase in the company s direct sales personnel 
this increase was offset by a change over in the industry to new higher capacity optical drives and the federal government shutdown which began in late fourth quarter and continued until march this shutdown delayed the sales of several large capacity units into as projects had to be restudied and justified 
management believes that the change to the higher capacity drives is substantially complete in the market and that the federal market is returning to normal conditions 
the general sales cycles for distribution of the company s products are similar to those of most businesses selling products designed for use as part of large systems  and range from three to six months for value added resellers var and small system integrators and from one to two years for original equipment manufacturers oem  product integrators and large system integrators 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  was approximately in  in and in cost of sales in was principally impacted by a price reduction for all units of in the fourth quarter of and a shift in product mix towards higher sales of smaller capacity units which have lower margins than the larger capacity units 
this shift was due in part to the federal government shutdown previously discussed 
in addition  gross margins were also affected by an increase in manufacturing engineering personnel to allow for a shift of sustaining product responsibility from research and development to manufacturing 
the company s relatively low gross margins reflect the company s low levels of net sales  which have resulted in unabsorbed manufacturing costs and high costs of materials due to the inability to achieve purchasing economies of scale due to low sales volume 
the company expects that  as product sales continue to increase  costs of sales per unit of product will decrease because fixed manufacturing costs will be distributed over the larger sales volume  and material costs will decrease as the result of volume purchases 
research and development expenses were  in   in and  in expenses remained relatively flat in as compared to as an increase in headcount was offset by a decrease in development materials 
the company has restructured its research and development group and is focused on building core competencies internally and new product development 
the company believes that research and development expenses will increase moderately in due to current projects under development 
marketing and sales expenses were  in   in and  in the primary reason for the increase was the expansion of the company s direct sales personnel 
the company believes that marketing and sales expenses will continue to increase in connection with the company s continued efforts to broaden market acceptance of its products 
general and administrative expenses were  in   in and  in the primary reason for the decrease in expenses was due to a decrease in legal expenses related to litigation that was resolved at the end of interest and other expense was  in   in and  in the decrease in is a result of payment on fewer capital lease agreements as several of the agreements expired in during   and  the company used   and  respectively primarily to fund operating losses 
in  the company raised  through the issuance of series g preferred stock 
also in march  the company entered into an agreement to raise an additional  through the issuance of subordinated convertible debentures 
in december  the agreement was amended to increase the amount of convertible debentures available to issue up to  of which  was received by december  in april   the agreement was amended again to increase the amount of convertible debentures available for issuance to  of which  was received by march  the company believes this cash together with borrowing from the credit line  which allows it to borrow the lesser of  or of eligible receivables  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements at least through the end of  although the company anticipates that it will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
the ability to sustain its operations for a significant period after december   will depend on the company s ability to significantly increase sales or raise significant additional equity or debt financing 
there is no assurance that any of these conditions will be achieved 
in particular  the company expects to require increasing amounts of cash to finance the company s efforts to increase sales  which the company plans to achieve by increasing selling efforts to large system integrators and oems by hiring additional sales and sales support staff and by making evaluation units available 
in addition  the company intends to expand its current network of resellers 
the company may require cash to finance purchases of inventory to satisfy anticipated increased sales as the company s products achieve market acceptance 
although the company has not committed to make any material capital expenditures  the budget for capital equipment expenditures for is approximately  the majority of these purchases are expected to be in the areas of process and molding tooling to improve the cost and producibility of the company s products 
the terms of the series c preferred stock and outstanding warrants may limit the availability of financing for the company  particularly equity financing 
holders of series c preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends in the amount of approximately  per year 
the company has never paid cash dividends and has no present plans to pay dividends
