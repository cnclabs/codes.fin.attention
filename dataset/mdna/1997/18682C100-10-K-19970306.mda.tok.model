general activity in the contract drilling industry and related oil service businesses has improved over the last two years due to increased worldwide demand stemming from higher levels of pricing for oil and natural gas 
over the past several years  the supply of offshore drilling rigs has declined while the demand for such rigs has increased  resulting in increases in worldwide utilization rates 
the financial condition and results of operations of the company and other drilling contractors are dependent upon the price of oil and natural gas  as demand for their services is primarily dependent upon the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  development and production activities 
crude oil and natural gas prices have continued to fluctuate over the last several years 
this price volatility creates some market uncertainties  despite the overall improvement in oil and gas market fundamentals 
the oil and gas industry has experienced extreme market cycles over the past decade 
the company has endeavored to mitigate the effect of this volatility by diversifying its scope of operations 
to achieve its strategic objective  the company established separate but related lines of business in daywork drilling  engineering services and mopu operations 
the company also has pursued foreign drilling and production opportunities in order to expand geographically 
each of the company s business segments will continue to be affected  however  by the unsettled energy markets  which are influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  the extent of worldwide oil and gas production and demand therefor  government regulations and environmental concerns

engineering services engineering services revenues increased million and operating income increased million in compared to the company completed turnkey contracts in compared to turnkey contracts in five of the contracts completed during were international contracts in venezuela  which were completed at improved margins from wells drilled in prior years 
international operating margins increased during due to improved drilling efficiencies and a reduction in lost time well activities 
domestic turnkey contractors continue to bid wells very aggressively  resulting in intense competition which has adversely affected the company s domestic turnkey margins 
the company had turnkey wells in progress at december   all of which were completed by february  the company provided well engineering and management services during and  primarily in venezuela 
these activities contributed operating income of 
million and 
million in and  respectively 
mopu operations mopu revenues decreased

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
despite the change in the mix of turnkey wells drilled  overall operating margins have decreased 
domestic turnkey operators have been very aggressive in pricing gulf of mexico turnkeys  and competition is intense 
various operational problems also caused turnkey margins to decline 
five of the turnkey wells completed in and one turnkey well in progress at december  encountered downhole problems and as a result  the company recorded losses of million in the results of operations on these contracts 
two of the wells which completed in encountered downhole problems and as a result  the company recorded losses of million in the results of operations on these contracts

operating activities net cash of million provided by operating activities included million used for working capital and other requirements 
accounts receivable increased from december  to december  due primarily to daywork drilling receivables associated with the southwestern rigs acquired on may   drilling operations in colombia  mexico and qatar and the timing of cash receipts related to international daywork and turnkey operations 
notes and other receivables  current increased primarily due to an insurance claim related to an underground blowout on a domestic turnkey well 
prepaid insurance increased due to an extension of the policy period of insurance coverage from the prior year and increased insurance premiums 
other prepaid expenses increased primarily due to a deposit related to the agp acquisition which closed on january  accounts payable and other accrued expenses increased due to increased domestic and international operations and the timing of payments 
investing activities net cash of million used to fund investing activities included million of acquisition costs and related capital expenditures associated with the jack up drilling rig acquisitions completed during may  and the land drilling rig acquisition completed in september  in addition  cash was used for upgrade and renovation activities on other drilling rigs and mopus 
on january   the company completed the agp acquisition for a purchase price of million in cash 
the atena  renamed cliffs drilling  is currently operating in venezuela 
the company expects to refurbish at least of the land drilling rigs for operations in venezuela during in addition to the rig acquisitions completed in january   the company has capital expenditure requirements totaling approximately million during of this total  approximately million relates to projects commenced in which will complete in  million relates to refurbishment of the land rigs obtained in the agp acquisition  million relates to upgrades which will be funded by customers through improved dayrates or contract terms and approximately million relates to other capital expenditures  including drill pipe 
the company intends to fund these capital expenditure requirements with available cash  internally generated cash flow and amounts currently available under its revolving credit facility 
investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates increased from december  to december  due primarily to million paid for the acquisition of an equity interest in the windjv 
on june   cliffs drilling completed its two year bareboat charter as a workover rig in the us gulf of mexico 
the charterer exercised its option to purchase the unit for million 
the company recognized a million gain on disposition of the unit during june  financing activities cash of million was provided by financing activities and included million generated from the placement of senior notes  offset in part by cash used to fund debt issue costs which are reported as deferred charges and other in the consolidated balance sheets 
in conjunction with the acquisition of the southwestern rigs  the company issued the senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually during each may and november 
the senior notes do not require any payments of principal prior to their stated maturity on may   but the company is required to make offers to purchase senior notes upon the occurrence of certain events as defined in the indenture  such as asset sales or a change of control of the company 
the senior notes are not redeemable at the option of the company prior to may  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company  ranking pari passu in right of payment with all senior indebtedness and senior to all subordinated indebtedness  and are guaranteed by the company s direct and indirect subsidiaries 
the indenture under which the senior notes are issued imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on the company 
such restrictions affect  and in many respects limit or prohibit  among other things  the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  sell assets and make dividends or other payments 
on june   the company and ing modified and amended the company s million revolving credit facility to  among other things  increase the amount available under such facility to million

million 
the company from time to time purchases its common stock in the open market 
during  the company purchased  shares of its common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 
million  or approximately per share 
all of the acquired shares are held as common stock in treasury  less shares issued under certain benefit plans 
exchange rate gains and losses approximately of the company s revenues and a substantial portion of its operating income were sourced from its venezuelan operations during these operations are subject to customary political and foreign currency risks in addition to operational risks 
the company has attempted to reduce these risks through insurance and the structure of its contracts 
the company may be exposed to the risk of foreign currency losses in connection with its foreign operations 
such losses are the result of holding net monetary assets cash and receivables in excess of payables denominated in foreign currencies during periods of a strengthening us dollar 
the company s foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily attributable to the venezuelan bolivar 
venezuela instituted currency exchange controls during june   which continued through all of and substantially eliminated exchange losses attributable to the company s venezuelan operations during most of the company realized million in gains in connection with venezuelan brady bond transactions during the first quarter of  however  the venezuelan government allowed the bolivar to float relative to other currencies on april  significant devaluation of the bolivar occurred at that date  which subjected the company to exchange rate losses on its net monetary assets 
foreign currency exchange rate losses of million incurred during offset exchange rate gains realized during the first quarter of the effects of these transactions are reported as exchange rate gain loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company does not speculate in foreign currencies or maintain significant foreign currency cash balances 
the company will continue to be exposed to future foreign currency gains and losses if the currency continues to be volatile 
despite the political and economic risks in venezuela  the company believes that the country continues to be a favorable market for its services 
cautionary statements the ability of the company to fund working capital  capital expenditures and debt service in excess of cash on hand will be dependent upon the success of the company s domestic and foreign operations 
to the extent that internal sources are insufficient to meet those cash requirements  the company can draw on its available credit facility or seek other debt or equity financing  however  the company can give no assurance that such other debt or equity financing would be available on terms acceptable to the company 
in any case  the satisfaction of long term capital requirements will depend upon successful implementation by the company of its business strategy and future results of operations 
management believes it has successfully implemented the strategy to achieve results of operations commensurate with its immediate and near term liquidity requirements
