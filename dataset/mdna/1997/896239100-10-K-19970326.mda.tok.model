in the company had a net loss of million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per share  in in september  the company implemented a work force reduction of approximately and consolidated certain manufacturing facilities and services 
these actions reduced sales and general and administrative expenses by approximately in the fourth quarter  compared to the third quarter of results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data as a percentage of total revenue years ended december revenue operating expenses cost of sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring charges total operating expenses operating income loss nonoperating income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss revenue

the table below shows revenues under the company s new operating structure that was created in september prior periods revenues have been reclassified in order to make amounts comparable 
years ended december  total total total revenue revenue revenue in thousands commercial systems    software component technologies    aerospace    total revenue    commercial systems the commercial systems business unit revenues decreased in from and had a growth rate of in over the decrease in as compared to is primarily in the land survey and tracking vertical markets 
the decrease in land survey sales in compared to was due to a slowdown in sales in europe and japan 
europe experienced a downturn in shipments due in part to construction spending in the major economies of europe being lower than traditional levels 
shipments of the higher end real time kinematic rtk survey product in japan has slowed due to the japanese government s decision to evaluate rtk survey methods before certifying its use for official surveys 
the company is now selling at the low cost end of the market as opposed to the high cost end of the market 
shipments in the us  latin america  and asia pacific outside japan were higher than last year 
this decrease in land survey was partially offset by an increase in revenues in the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  which was due to increased acceptance of the company s products  extension of sales efforts into new geographic territories  and an increase in the number of field sales employees 
tracking revenues are lower in compared to  primarily due to lower sales to american mobile satellite corporation amsc 
in march  the company signed a large contract for the supply of galaxy gps land mobile satellite terminals to amsc  a reston  virginia  based company that provides a variety of voice and data services via satellite 
amsc contracted for delivery of product beginning in mid and continuing through late in the fourth quarter of  amsc requested that the company cease delivery  in part due to delays in amsc s completion of software 
shipments under the original contract were halted in the fourth quarter of and the contract was amended 
revenues from shipments to amsc under this contract during were  in the second quarter and  in the third quarter 
contract renegotiation fees of  were recognized in the first quarter of the amended contract between the company and amsc calls for production line shutdown fees for the time that trimble is not manufacturing product for shipment to amsc 
due to the uncertainty about amsc s ability to pay  revenues for products shipped and contractual shutdown fees were not recognized until collection was considered probable 
in the second quarter of  the company recognized  in revenue from products shipped in december and march  and  of shutdown fees  all of which have been paid 
in the third quarter of  the company recognized  of shutdown fees  all of which have been paid 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized  of shutdown fees  all of which have been paid 
on february   an agreement was signed between trimble and amsc to resume shipments of its galaxy gps terminals at the rate of units per month  beginning in march as a result of this agreement the company has dropped a complaint which was filed in october against amsc in the superior court of california in santa clara county 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more details 
in september  the company entered into a contract with caterpillar inc to develop and market products for the construction and mining markets 
the company agreed to develop  without funding from caterpillar inc  customized equipment starting in the fourth quarter of and to sell it exclusively to caterpillar for use in this market 
shipments are expected to start in the first half of the company also expects average selling prices will likely decline with increased competition 
in addition to the markets the company currently addresses in the surveying and mapping arena primarily land survey  the company is addressing new markets  including the mining and construction market 
if the company cannot adequately compete in new markets through the development and manufacture of new products  there can be no assurance that growth will continue 
in  commercial systems revenue was supplemented by million received under a contract with a customer whereby the company agreed not to compete  and sold exclusive distribution rights 
software and component technologies the software and component technologies business unit revenues have grown in from and in over the increase in from was due to a slight increase in demand 
the increase in from was due to alliances with philips car system and xanavi informatics corporation for in vehicle navigation and glenayre technologies in the timing market 
the software and component technologies market consists of oem original equipment manufacture and consumer products 
in  software component technologies revenue was supplemented by technology licenses of million 
aerospace aerospace product sales slight decrease from to reflects weak sales for military products in  compared to a strong sales for these sales were offset by strong sales for aviation products in  compared with weak aviation product sales for on september   the company received faa certification of the ht product allowing production and installation to begin late in the third quarter 
this product accounted for most of the increase in aerospace revenues for the second half of  compared to the second half of aslo  aviation product sales were higher in the second half of  as compared to  due in part to sales of product acquired from terra corporation see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company considers its aerospace products to be a long term growth opportunity 
it believes that success in this area will be dependent upon the success of a current strategic alliance with honeywell 
military sales are highly dependent on contracts which are subject to government approval and are  therefore  expected to continue to fluctuate from period to period 
the company believes that opportunities in this market have been substantially reduced by cutbacks in us and foreign military spending 
export sales from domestic operations  as a percentage of total revenue  were in  in and in sales to unaffiliated customers in foreign locations  as a percentage of total revenue  was in  in  and in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company anticipates that export revenue and sales made by its subsidiaries in locations outside the us will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenue  and  therefore  the company is subject to the risks inherent in these sales  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  governmental approval  tariffs or other barriers 
even though the us government announced on march   that it would support and maintain the gps system  as well as eliminate the use of selective availability s a a method of degrading gps accuracy  in certain foreign markets there may be a reluctance to purchase products based on gps technology  given the control of gps by the us government 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if the company were unable to continue to generate significant sales in locations outside the us no single customer  including the us government and its agencies  accounted for or more of total revenue in  or it is possible  however  that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by the company may adversely affect results of operations 
gross margin 
gross margin varies due to a number of factors  including product mix  domestic versus international sales  customer type  the effects of production volumes and fixed manufacturing costs on unit product costs and new product start up costs 
in  the gross margin percentage on product sales was  compared with in and in the margins are enhanced by the positive impact of non product revenues recognized from amsc of million in see results of operations revenue for more details 
the company has a history of recording such non recurring items in the past  including revenues of million in there can be no assurance that similar items will recur in the future 
the decrease in the gross margin percentages primarily reflects a shift in product mix from higher margin commercial systems sales to lower margin avionics and oem products  and decreases in the margins obtained on sales of commercial systems products 
in addition  because of mix changes within and among the business units  market pressures on unit selling prices  fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs and other factors  there is no assurance that current margins will be sustained 
while commercial systems products have the highest gross margins of all the company s products  their margins have decreased primarily due to the need to lower prices in response to competition 
the company expects competition to increase in its commercial systems markets and it is therefore likely that further price erosion will occur  with consequent lower gross margins percentages 
in the future  the company expects a higher percentage of its business to be conducted through alliances with strategic partners  eg honeywell and caterpillar  for example 
as a result of volume pricing and the assumption of certain operating costs by the partner  margins for this business are likely to be lower than sales directly to end users 
operating expense 
the following table shows operating expenses for the periods indicated  and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below years ended december  in thousands research and development    sales and marketing    general and administrative    restructuring charges  total    research and development 
research and development spending increased during  representing of revenue as compared with in both and the increase from to is due primarily to an increase in personnel and the related expenses which accompany an increase in the number of employees 
there was also an increase in the number of specialized engineering consultants and temporary employees 
the increase in research and development is part of the company s continuing aggressive development of future products 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased during  representing of revenue  in  and in the primary reason for the dollar increases in expenses since is an increase in personnel and advertising costs 
other less significant reasons for the increases are higher marketing related and field service support costs 
selling and marketing expenses are expected to decrease in the future as a percentage of revenue  as a result of the restructuring actions taken in september sales offices in china  egypt  italy and poland were closed  and the sizes of certain offices in the us has been reduced 
the company s future growth will depend on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which the company currently competes  and upon the company s ability to continue to identify and exploit new markets for its products 
in addition  the company has encountered significant competition in selected markets  and the company expects such competition to intensify as the market for gps applications receives acceptance 
several of the company s competitors are major corporations with substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and manufacturing resources 
increased competition is likely to result in reduced market share and in price reductions of gps based products  which could adversely affect the company s revenues and profitability 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased in over primarily as a result of the higher litigation and legal settlement costs incurred in the first six months of the year  as compared to the same period in  as well as an increase in the bad debt expense and amortization of goodwill related to the terra acquisition 
the company expects legal fees to continue to be high  due to the company s involvement in litigation matters 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in over was due to increased legal fees  information systems support costs  an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable  as well as an increase in administrative costs in the business units 
restructuring charges 
during the quarter ended september   the company recorded a restructuring charge of  an additional  was added in the fourth quarter of as of december    of restructuring costs had been paid 
components of this restructuring reserve included employee severance packages  the costs of redundant office space  and write downs of idle assets 
the company took this action in order to bring operating expenses into line with revenues and to restructure existing operations in a more efficient manner 
as part of the restructuring  the company reorganized itself into three business units commercial systems  software and component technologies  and aerospace 
there can be no guarantee that the results of the restructuring will be successful and will have the intended effect 
nonoperating income expense  net 
nonoperating income expense  net  includes interest income and expense  as well as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and  in  a royalty arbitration settlement charge 
foreign exchange losses were  in  compared with a gain of million in in the second quarter of the company adopted a policy of hedging its exposure to foreign currency transactions to minimize the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on consolidated results of operations 
gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward contracts offset gains and losses resulting from the underlying hedged transactions 
most of the foreign exchange gains recorded in were incurred in the period before this policy was in place 
interest income increased in due to higher interest income received on cash and short term investments in the first half of  compared with the first half of  primarily from the company s public offering proceeds in august interest income increased in over  primarily due to higher interest income received on higher levels of cash and short term investments resulting primarily from the company s public offering proceeds 
interest expense increased slightly in due to higher fees on unused lines of credit 
interest expense includes interest on a million note issued in august  and fees on unused lines of credit 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for details of long term debt and lines of credit 
during  the company recorded a charge of million to reflect an unfavorable court decision related to a dispute between the company and avion systems inc as to certain technology the company licensed from avion in see notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax provision 
the company s combined federal  foreign and state effective income tax benefit of in is less than the federal statutory tax rate of  primarily due to limitations on the utilization of the operating loss 
the income tax provision of in  and in is less than the statutory rate  primarily due to realization of previously reserved deferred tax assets 
the rate is higher than the rate  primarily due to higher foreign taxes 
inflation 
the effects of inflation upon the company s financial results have not been significant to date 
litigation the company is involved in a number of legal matters that occupy an increasing amount of management time and expense 
these matters are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
while the company does not expect to suffer significant adverse effects from this litigation  or unasserted claims  the nature of litigation is unpredictable  and there can be no assurance that it will not do so 
liquidity and capital resources in the cash used in operating activities was million 
cash provided by sales of common stock in represents proceeds from purchases made pursuant to the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans  and totaled million 
during the company has relied primarily on cash provided by financing activities and net sales of short term investments to fund operations  capital expenditures and other investing activities 
the company s ability to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on revenues and the rate of collections of accounts receivable 
in operating activities provided cash flows of million 
cash flow from financing activities consisted primarily of million from the sale of million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering  and million from issuances under various employee stock plans 
these sources of cash flow were used primarily to pay down long term debt of million and purchase property and equipment of million 
the remaining cash flow was used to increase cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in august  the company entered into a million unsecured line of credit agreement with two banks  it expires in july the agreement enables the company to borrow up to million provided that certain financial and other covenants are met 
the agreement provides for payment of a commitment fee of for the unused portion of the line of credit 
borrowings bear interest at the higher of i one of the bank s annual prime rate  and ii the federal funds rate plus 
in august the company terminated a prior million line of credit agreement originally entered into in january no borrowings were made under either the old or new lines of credit during and in february  the company announced that it had approved a discretionary program whereby up to  shares of its common stock may be repurchased to offset potential dilutive effects to earnings per share from the issuance of stock options 
the company intends to use existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to finance any stock repurchases under this program 
in   shares were purchased at a cost of  and the company intends to continue repurchasing its common stock under this program 
the company presently expects capital expenditures to be approximately million  primarily for production equipment  computer equipment  software  and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million in short term investments 
the company s long term debt consisted primarily of a million note obligation due in  and the company had no debt outstanding under its line of credit 
the company believes that its current cash balances  available bank financing  and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs in the foreseeable future 
certain other risk factors revenue has tended to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to the timing of shipments of products under contracts  the sale of licensee rights  and seasonal patterns favoring spring and summer for commercial systems business 
this pattern was not repeated in and the company can give no assurances that there will be any reversion to the seasonal revenue trends 
a significant portion of quarterly revenues occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of a quarter 
if orders are not received  or if shipments were to be delayed a few days at the end of a quarter  the operating results and reported earnings per share could be significantly impacted 
future revenues are difficult to predict  and projections are based primarily on historical models which are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 
the company has a relatively fixed cost structure in the short term which is determined by the business plans and strategies the company intends to implement in the markets it addresses 
this effective leveraging means that increases or decreases in revenues have more than a proportional impact on net income or losses 
the company estimates that a change in product revenue of million would change earnings per share by to cents 
a number of products that were previously being manufactured by terra have yet to be certified by the federal aviation authority 
unless the company receives this certification  revenues from sales of terra products may be lower than expected 
in the longer term  the company believes that the software and component technologies business unit will comprise a significant portion of the company s business 
the software and component technologies business unit differs in nature from most of the company s markets because volumes are high and margins relatively low 
software and component technologies customers are extremely price sensitive 
as costs decrease through technological advances  these advances will be passed on to the customer 
to compete in the software and component technologies market requires high volume production and manufacturing techniques 
customers expect high quality standards with very low defect rates 
the company is relatively inexperienced compared to competitors with far greater resources in such high volume manufacturing and associated support activities 
the value of the company s products relies substantially on the company s technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings 
the company recognizes that as new patents are issued or are brought to the company s attention by the holders of such patents  it may be necessary for the company to withdraw products from the market  take a license from such patent holders  or redesign its products 
the company does not believe any of its products infringe patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  but cannot be certain that they do not 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations 
such events could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues or profitability 
the company is continually evaluating alliances and external investments in technologies related to its business  and has already entered into alliances and made relatively small investments in gps related technology companies 
acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  or products and alliances entail numerous risks  including i the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value  ii diversion of management s attention  and iii loss of key employees of acquired operations 
any such problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
no assurances can be given that the company will not incur problems from current or future alliances  acquisitions  or investments 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will realize value from any such alliances  acquisitions  or investments
