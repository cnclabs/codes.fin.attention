item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data  the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the information described under the caption risk factors below 
overview the operating results of abiomed reflect the dual activities of commercial operations and investments in the research and development of new technologies 
since fiscal  the first full year marketing the bvs in the us  increasing new orders and reorders of the bvs have made product revenues the largest contributor to the company s operating results 
the company sells and supports the bvs through a team of domestic sales  clinical support and marketing people consisting of twenty eight people 
the company believes that this team and the effectiveness of the bvs in saving lives are the primary reasons for increases in product revenues in each of its first four years of domestic sales of the bvs 
research and development of new technologies and products is a significant portion of abiomed s operations 
total research and development costs  including costs of research and development under government contracts  have increased in each of the past three years 
in each of these years  the company s research and development costs have exceeded of product revenues 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenues represented by the respective line items set forth below of the company s consolidated statement of operations set forth below year ended march  revenues products contracts costs and expenses cost of products sold cost of contract research and development internal research and development selling  marketing  general and administrative total costs and operating expenses 
income from operations interest income and other provision for income taxes net income loss net income loss net income and income per share increased to  and for the year ended march  fiscal from  and in fiscal and from a net loss and net loss per share of  and in fiscal these increases primarily reflect increased revenues 
revenues consolidated total revenues  excluding interest income  for fiscal rose to a record  as compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal this represents increases of and for fiscal and respectively 
product revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and  in fiscal the and product revenue increases in fiscal and  respectively  were primarily attributable to growing us unit sales of the bvs consoles and disposable products  including increased blood pump reorders  and to increased average selling prices of bvs consoles and disposable products 
at march   the company s product backlog totaled approximately  the majority of the company s product revenues in the last three years have been to us customers 
international revenues represented  and of total product revenues in fiscal  and respectively 
the company s product revenues from its dental business  abiodent  increased in fiscal but were less than of total product revenues 
contract revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal and  in fiscal  representing increases of for both fiscal and contract revenues are based upon cost reimbursement and  therefore  these increases are reflective of the increased level of the company s research and development activities in each year 
the majority of the company s contract revenues  approximately in fiscal  was recognized in connection with the research and development for the company s implantable battery operated total artificial heart tah 
the tah revenue was earned under a two phase contract totaling approximately million awarded by the national heart  lung and blood institute nhlbi 
phase i of the contract ended in september phase ii of the contract was awarded in september with a total value of million over four years 
the funding for the company s government research and development contracts is subject to government appropriation 
for the first year of the tah contract  million was appropriated by the government 
as of march   the remaining balance of the tah contract and the remaining balance of appropriated funds under this contract were approximately million and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the government will not terminate or reduce or delay the funding for any of the company s contracts 
the company s spending for tah development has increased in each of the past two years and the company anticipates that this spending will further increase in fiscal the company also believes that its spending under the tah contract will exceed the remaining appropriated balance under this contract during its first quarter of fiscal the quarter ending june  and that no further amounts will be appropriated for the tah contract prior to october  as a result of the company s increasing and significant spending levels for the tah combined with the timing of government appropriations under the company s tah contract  the company anticipates that in coming fiscal quarters  including the first quarter of fiscal  its spending for tah development will exceed the appropriated reimbursement and revenue levels available under the tah contract for those fiscal quarters 
the company believes that certain of these tah costs may be reimbursable under the tah contract in and when such additional appropriation is received but that total tah expenses for fiscal will likely exceed the amount appropriated for the fiscal year 
see risk factors reliance on government contracts 
at march  the company was working on a number of contracts and grants representing a total contract and grant backlog of approximately million compared to a contract and grant backlog of approximately million as of march  of this march  backlog  approximately million is in support of phase ii of the tah and approximately million is for continued research and development of the implantable heart booster 
all such government contracts contain provisions making them terminable at the convenience of the government 
the company retains the rights  royalty free and clear  to manufacture and market the products developed under these government contracts and grants 
costs and expenses costs and expenses for fiscal increased to  compared to  and  in fiscal and respectively  representing increases of and for fiscal and these increases in fiscal and primarily reflect increased costs related to product sales  increased activity related to research and development grants and contracts and increased sales and marketing expenses to support increased revenues 
cost of product revenues represented approximately  and of product revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margins experienced in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable the mix of product sold  with a higher proportion of revenues derived from bvs consoles sold in fiscal compared to fiscal  and to increased costs of production of the disposable blood pump  including approximately  in direct costs and other indirect costs related to the company s voluntary recall during the third quarter of fiscal of certain production lots of disposable bvs blood pumps 
cost of research and development increased to approximately  in fiscal compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
these increases reflect increased activity under research and development contracts and grants which are billed on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
costs of internal research and development primarily relate to continued engineering support and improvement of existing products as well as regulatory support for all products 
the company anticipates that its spending for research and development will continue to increase  particularly as it relates to the tah 
in certain periods  as discussed above  this spending is likely to exceed the government appropriated balance under the tah contract from the nhlbi 
the company also believes that  at it moves closer to the development of the tah as a product  an increasing portion of the company s tah spending will be funded internally 
such tah spending outside the tah contract or in excess of the appropriated amount under the tah contract is likely to be significant 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to approximately  in fiscal from  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these increases primarily reflect increased costs associated with higher sales revenues  including the expansion of the us based sales team and clinical post sales support personnel 
interest and other revenues and expenses interest income  net of interest and other expenses  totaled approximately   and  for fiscal  and  respectively  and primarily represents income earned on short term investments 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company s balance sheet included approximately  in cash and marketable securities  a decrease of  over the company s  balance of cash and marketable securities at march  this decrease primarily reflects the company s investment in equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately  and approximately  used in operations  partially offset by approximately  in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
the march  cash and marketable securities balance includes approximately  in cash and  in investments all with maturities of less than one year 
working capital increased from approximately  at march  to approximately  at march  the primary operating sources of cash during fiscal were net income of approximately  depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately  an increase in accounts payable of approximately  and an increase in accrued expenses of approximately  these sources of cash were offset by an increase in accounts receivable of approximately  an increase in inventory of approximately  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of approximately  the increase in accounts receivable is attributable to increased revenues and extended collection periods for certain accounts 
the increase in accounts payable is primarily attributed to increased purchases and timing of purchases of direct materi als and capital equipment for manufacturing and r d 
net cash used by investing activities is primarily attributable to approximately  of purchases of capital equipment and leasehold improvements for manufacturing and r d 
as of march  the company had no borrowings or other debt 
the company has a  unsecured line of credit from a bank which expires september the line of credit  if used  bears interest at the banks prime rate 
although the company does not currently have significant capital commitments  the company believes that it will continue to make significant investments over the next several years to support the development and commercialization of its products under development 
in particular  the company has begun to increase its development and testing efforts related to its tah 
the company believes that the total cost of developing and commercializing the tah will exceed the amount available under its existing government contract and that additional funding will be needed for this development and commercialization 
the company is evaluating alternative sources of funding to address this need 
the company believes that its revenues and its existing resources are sufficient to meet its operating needs for the current fiscal year 
see risk factors future capital needs and uncertainty of additional funding 
risk factors this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of the company s plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
uncertainty of product development 
the company has developed and markets a limited number of products and believes that its future success will in large part be dependent upon its ability to develop and market innovative new products  such as the tah and heart booster 
the successful development of these products presents enormous challenges 
the tah  which is being designed to take over the function of a human heart  and the heart booster  which is being designed to provide permanent support to an ailing heart  must demonstrate that they can operate effectively and reliably within a patient over an extended period 
for many years  the company and others have been attempting to develop mechanical products that meet these needs and have not yet been successful 
initial testing of the tah  heart booster and other products being developed by the company will be conducted in simulated environments before they are tested in humans 
until the products have been clinically assessed there can be no assurance that any of these products will perform as expected in humans 
in addition  the company s product development will include all other risks associated with new product development  including unanticipated delays  expenses  technical problems or other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the commercialization of these new products 
successful development of these products will also require fda and corresponding foreign regulatory approvals 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in introducing products on a timely basis and within budget  if at all 
government regulation 
medical devices  including enhancements to existing medical products  cannot be marketed in the us without clearance or approval by the fda 
medical devices sold in the us must also be manufactured in compliance with fda good manufacturing practices  which regulate the design  manufacture  packaging  storage and installation of medical devices 
moreover  medical devices are required to comply with fda regulations relating to investigational research  labeling and post market reporting 
states may also regulate the manufacture  sale and use of medical devices 
the company s products are also subject to approval and regulation by certain foreign regulatory and safety agencies 
the process of obtaining and maintaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time consuming 
the company believes that regulatory oversight of medical devices is becoming more stringent in many foreign countries 
beginning june   in accordance with regulations of the european union  in order for medical devices to be marketed in europe  the product and the manufacturer must comply with the medical device directive which includes iso and product compliance 
the bvs and the company currently do not meet this requirement and there can be no assurance that the bvs or the company will be in compliance by june  many manufacturers of medical devices  including the company  have often relied on foreign markets for the initial commercial introduction of their products 
the more strict foreign regulatory environment could make it more difficult  costly and time consuming for the company to pursue this strategy for new products 
moreover  any fda  foreign or state regulatory approvals or clearances  once obtained  can be withdrawn or modified 
delay in the company obtaining  or inability of the company to obtain and maintain  any necessary us or foreign clearances or approvals for new or existing products or product enhancements  or cost overruns resulting from these regulatory requirements  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and prospects 
anticipated future losses 
the company plans to use significant resources to internally fund the development of the tah in amounts significantly in excess of the funding under the company s nhlbi development contract 
as a result  the company believes that it may again incur losses 
the amount and duration of these losses will depend upon a number of factors  including the company s ability to increase sales and profitability of its present products  to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for new products and product enhancements  to successfully manufacture and market these new products and enhancements  the timing and extent of the company s spending related to product development and the timing of government appropriations related to the company s nhlbi contracts 
the company anticipates that it spending under its nhlbi contract to develop the tah will  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  exceed the amount which the government has currently appropriated for that contract 
there can be no assurance that the government will appropriate the additional annual amounts scheduled under the nhlbi contract for the tah 
future capital needs and uncertainty of additional funding 
the company is working on the research and development of several long term products 
the company has stepped up its development of these products  particularly the tah  which will result in significantly increased internally funded research and development expenditures  including costs of clinical trials 
the company estimates that it will require significant additional funds in order to complete the development and achieve fda approval of the tah 
generally  estimates of long term project costs are extremely imprecise and cost overruns are common 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will not require significantly more resources to complete the development of the tah or any of its other products 
the company plans to fund this effort through a combination of its nhlbi tah development contract  existing resources  sales of securities and cash flow from sales of its existing products 
even if the company does not experience cost overruns  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain sufficient funds to complete the development of the tah or any other product 
moreover  the company may require additional funds to commence the manufacture and marketing of the tah or any of the company s other products under development in commercial quantities  if and when approved or cleared by the fda 
failure of the company to obtain any required additional funding could delay product development and otherwise materially and adversely affect the business of the company 
there can be no assurance that that the company would be able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms  if at all 
substantial reliance on bvs product line  early stage of bvs market development 
in the fiscal  sales of the bvs and related products and services represented more than ninety percent of the company s product revenues 
the company believes that this dependence on the bvs product line is likely to continue for at least the next several years  until the company is able to complete development and successfully market one or more of its other products under development 
the market for the bvs continues to be in the early stage of development 
the company has initially focused its marketing efforts on larger medical centers and hospitals  and has expended substantial efforts in educating and training physicians  technicians and nurses at those centers and hospitals in the use of the device 
the continued commercial success of the bvs will be dependent upon both the company s ability to sell the bvs to smaller hospitals and medical centers  which generally have more limited financial resources  and the increase of the use of the bvs at those medical centers and hospitals which have purchased the systems 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in marketing the bvs 
failure of the company to expand the market for and use of the bvs could have a material adverse affect on its business and prospects 
markets for products under development unproven 
most of the company s products under development  including the tah and heart booster  are targeting new and unproven markets 
as a result  it is likely that the company s evaluation of the potential markets for these products will materially vary with time 
in addition  the effective use of these products will likely require development of new surgical techniques by well trained physicians  which will initially limit the market for the company s products 
the timing and amount of reimbursement by health care insurers for the use of these products  once developed  will also have a significant impact on the market for these products 
other companies may also introduce products which will compete with these products  reduce the market for these products  or render these products obsolete 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to market any of its products under development successfully  if and when these products are developed 
failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and prospects 
dependence on third party reimbursement 
the company sells its medical products to physicians and medical institutions who are typically reimbursed for use of such products by government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
market acceptance of these products depends in large part on the extent to which reimbursement for the use of such products is available to the physicians and medical institutions 
the level of reimbursement provided by us government health agencies  private health insurers and many foreign health care insurance systems varies according to a variety of factors  including the insurer  location  medical procedure classification and cost 
for example  medicare reimburses for the surgical procedures in which the bvs is used  and incrementally reimburses physicians for use of the bvs 
however  medicare does not incrementally reimburse medical institutions for use of the bvs 
certain private payer insurance companies provide incremental reimbursement to both physicians and medical institutions 
the company is currently working with the health care finance administration hcfa  which establishes guidelines for the reimbursement of health care providers treating medicare and medicaid patients  to recommend the incremental reimbursement of medical institutions for use of the bvs 
the recommendations of hcfa frequently are also followed by private health care insurance providers 
as a result  the company believes that a hcfa recommendation to reimburse medical centers for the incremental cost of the use of the bvs will be important to promote the more widespread use of the bvs 
there can be no assurance that hcfa will approve such additional reimbursement on a timely basis  if at all 
no reimbursement levels have been established for most of the company s products being developed  including the tah and heart booster 
generally  reimbursement for the use of such products is not provided until the products are approved by the fda 
there can be no assurance that government health administration authorities or private health insurers will approve reimbursement for the use of these products  if and when approved by the fda  or that if reimbursement is provided  that the levels of reimbursement will be sufficient to support the widespread use of those products 
failure to obtain adequate reimbursement policies for the use of its products would have a material adverse affect on the company s business 
uncertainty of health care reform 
health care reform and medical cost containment have been areas of significant attention in the us and many foreign countries 
certain reform proposals and cost containment measures could limit the use of the company s products or reduce reimbursement available for such use 
as a result  such reforms or cost containment measures could materially and adversely affect sales of the company s products 
uncertainty in the medical community regarding the nature and effect of proposed health care reforms and cost containment measures may also have a material adverse effect on purchases of the company s products 
fluctuations and unpredictability of operating results 
significant annual and quarterly fluctuations in the company s results of operations may be caused by  among other factors  the overall state of health care and cost containment efforts  economic conditions in the company s markets  the expense and timing of the company s development efforts for a particular product or product enhancement  the potential need to recall or rework product from time to time  timing of government appropriations related to research contracts and grants  changes in insurance reimbursement policies for the company s products  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales  variations in the company s product mix and component costs  the timing of customer orders  adjustments of delivery schedules to accommodate customers  inventory levels of products at customers including inventory at distributors  changes in the government s funding policies under the company s existing contracts  pricing and other competitive conditions  and the timing of the announcement  introduction and delivery of new products and product enhancements by the company and its competitors 
customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
relatively few bvs system sales comprise a significant portion of the company s product revenues in each quarter 
therefore  small variations in the number of systems sold have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
the company also believes that sales of its bvs may be somewhat seasonal  with reduced sales in the summer months  reflecting hospital personnel and physician vacation schedules 
beginning in fiscal  the company anticipates potentially significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in contract revenues and research and development costs associated with its tah development due to the need for additional government appropriations under the nhlbi contract and to increased levels of company spending 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
reliance on government contracts 
the company often relies on external funding for its basic research and development  primarily through government research contracts and grants 
such funding has been responsible for the initial development of the majority of the company s current products and products under development 
in particular  in september  the company was awarded by the nhlbi a four year million extension to its contract for development of the total artificial heart  and in october the company was awarded a five year million contract from the nhlbi for development of the company s heart booster 
as of march   the company s total backlog of government contracts and grants was million 
such contracts and grants are not expected to be sufficient to bring the underlying products to market and for certain products  including the total artificial heart  the cost of product development in excess of the contract value is expected to be significant 
the company anticipates that it will continue to seek government contracts and grants to support development efforts 
funding for the company s government research and development contracts is subject to government appropriation  and all of these contracts contain provisions which make them terminable at the convenience of the government 
although the company has not experienced reductions  delays or termination of funding of its government contracts  recent concerns over the federal budget deficit has resulted in the decrease or delays in funding and termination of other government contracts and program 
there can be no assurance that the government will not terminate or reduce or delay the funding for any of the company s contracts 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining any new government contracts or further extensions to existing contracts 
a significant delay or reduction of funding under the company s government contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and prospects 
potential inadequacy of product liability insurance 
the company s business involves the risk of product liability claims inherent in the manufacture and marketing of life support systems 
there are many factors beyond the control of the company that could result in the failure of the bvs to sustain the life of a patient  the most important of which is the condition of the patient prior to the use of the product 
as a result  many of the patients using the bvs do not survive 
in addition  the effectiveness of the company s products could be adversely affected by the reliability of the physicians  nurses and technicians using and monitoring the use of the product  and the maintenance of the product by the company s customers 
the failure of the bvs or any other life support system under development by the company to save a life could give rise to product liability claims and result in negative publicity that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company currently maintains product liability insurance with an aggregate coverage limit of million per year  subject to certain deductibles and exclusions 
there can be no assurance that this insurance will be sufficient to protect the company from product liability claims  or that product liability insurance will continue to be available to the company at a reasonable cost  if at all 
the risk of product liability claims against the company may increase as the company introduces new products under development  particularly products such as the tah and heart booster intended for permanent life support 
the tah is being designed to support patients for their entire remaining lives  until either the tah ceases to work or is stopped due to failure of another vital organ 
as with all mechanical devices  the tah will have a finite life 
despite the company s best efforts to develop a reliable  zero defect  high quality tah  the eventual failure of the tah could give rise to product liability claims  regardless of whether the tah has extended or improved the quality of the patient s life beyond that expected without the use of the tah 
the heart booster  if developed  will result in similar product liability risk 
as a result of the additional product liability risks that will be associated with the tah  heart booster and other products under development by the company  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure product liability insurance for these products  when and if developed  or that such insurance will be available in sufficient quantities to protect the company at an acceptable cost 
the failure of the company to be able to obtain adequate product liability insurance  if any  for these products could have a material adverse effect on its business 
dependence on limited sources of supply 
the company relies on outside vendors to supply certain components used in the bvs and in its products under development 
certain of the components of the bvs are supplied by sole source vendors or are custom made for the company 
and  suppliers of certain components of the bvs have indicated that they intend to discontinue  or have discontinued  making such components 
in addition  certain of these components are supplied from single sources due to quality considerations  costs or constraints imposed by regulatory authorities 
there are relatively few additional sources of supply for such components and establishing additional or replacement suppliers for such components cannot be accomplished quickly 
in the past  certain suppliers have announced that  due to government regulation or in an effort to reduce potential product liability exposure  they intend to limit or terminate sales of certain products to the medical industry 
although the company does not expect any interruption of its current product production due to the lack of available supplies  there can be no assurances that  if such an interruption were to occur  the company would be able to find suitable alternative supplies at reasonable prices 
similarly  when and if the company reaches the clinical testing stage of its products under development  it may find that certain components become more difficult to source from outside vendors due to the product liability risk perceived by those vendors 
the company s inability to obtain acceptable components in a timely manner or to find suitable replacements at an acceptable cost would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
competition and technological change 
competition in the cardiac assist market is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards 
many of the companies developing or marketing cardiac assist products have substantially greater financial  product development  sales and marketing resources and experience than the company 
these competitors may develop superior products or products of similar quality at the same or lower prices 
moreover  there can be no assurance that improvements in current or new technologies will not make them technically equivalent or superior to the company s products in addition to providing cost or other advantages 
other advances in medical technology and biotechnology may reduce the size of the potential markets for the company s products or render those products obsolete 
to date  the fda has not approved any product other than the company s bvs for treatment of post cardiotomy shock 
approval by the fda of products that compete directly with the bvs would increase competitive pricing and other pressures and could adversely affect the company s revenue and income from sales of the bvs 
the company s customers frequently have limited budgets 
as a result  the company s products compete against the broad range of medical devices for these limited funds 
the company s success will depend in large part upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop new products to meet regulatory and customer requirements and to achieve market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in introducing products or product enhancements on a timely basis  if at all  that the company will be able to market these products and product enhancements once developed  or that the company otherwise will be able to compete effectively 
dependence on patents and proprietary rights 
the company s business depends significantly upon proprietary technology 
the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions to establish  maintain and protect its proprietary rights  all of which afford only limited protection 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s patent applications will be granted  that any patent or patent application will provide significant protection for the company s products and technology  or that any of the company s patent claims would be upheld if challenged 
in the absence of significant patent protection  the company may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy the company s products  processes or technology 
the company also protects its proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and non compete agreements with industry partners  consultants and all of its employees 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that the company s trade secrets and proprietary know how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
management of growth 
the company has undergone a period of growth  and its continued expansion  particularly to support a step up of its product development efforts  may significantly strain the company s management  financial and other resources 
due to the level of technical and marketing expertise necessary to support its ongoing research and development  manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts  the company must attract and retain highly qualified and well trained personnel 
there are a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions  and it may become increasingly difficult for the company to hire such personnel 
the company s expansion may also significantly strain the company s management  manufacturing  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s operations 
failure to manage the company s growth properly could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is highly dependent on the principal members of its scientific  sales  and management staff  the loss of whose service could have a material adverse effect on the company 
competition among medical device companies for highly skilled scientific  sales and management personnel is intense 
in addition  in order for the company to successfully develop its tah and other products under development  the company will have to continue to hire and train high quality employees 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain all personnel necessary for the development of its business 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its business 
international sales 
in fiscal  international sales accounted for of the company s product revenues 
the company s international sales are subject to certain additional risks  including risks of exchange rate fluctuations  us and foreign regulatory requirements and policy changes  foreign reimbursement practices and policy changes  political and economic instability  inventory management  accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  tariff regulations and seasonality of sales 
most foreign countries have their own standards and regulatory approval requirements for the company s products 
as a result  the company s introduction of new products and product enhancements into international markets can be costly and time consuming and there can be no assurance that the company will obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
although the company s international sales have been denominated in us dollars  the value of the u 
s 
dollar in relation to foreign currencies may adversely affect the company s sales to foreign customers 
to the extent that the company expands its international operations or changes its pricing practices to denominate prices in foreign currencies  the company will be exposed to increased risks of currency fluctuation
