the increase in gross margin in fiscal was largely attributable to the higher gross margin in multimedia chipset products 
in fiscal  the gross margin of mpeg boards and chipsets was recorded at and  respectively 
the comparatively low gross margin in fiscal and was primarily the result of inventory reserves and write offs in connection with the company s strategic move away from non multimedia products and the transition to a new generation of mpeg based products

although the company attempts to minimize the impact of such product transitions  the market for the company s products is volatile and subject to the impact of changes in technology and other competitive factors see factors affecting future operating results and  as a result  there is no assurance that the company will not have similar reserves and write offs in the future

the company completed its acquisition of active design corporation in fiscal  which resulted in a  non recurring merger expense charged to general and administration expenses

the company also experienced significant increases in its accounts receivable and inventory during fiscal  largely due to a higher sales volume and longer customer payment terms common in the oem market  as compared to revenue patterns in fiscal the company s primary sources of funds to date have been cash generated from operations  proceeds from common stock issuances  and bank borrowings under lines of credit 
the company believes that its current reserve of cash and equivalents and short term investments and the availability of funds under its existing cash and asset based banking arrangements will be sufficient to satisfy its cash needs for the next twelve months 
as of january   the company had million outstanding under a million bank line of credit that expires in september and is collateralized by funds on deposit in accounts that have been assigned to the lender 
the company also has a million bank line of credit available that expires in september and is secured by the company s accounts receivable  inventories  equipment  and intangibles 
beyond the next twelve month period  the company believes that to the extent it does not generate cash from operations  it may have to raise additional capital through either public or private offerings of its common stock or from additional bank financing 
there is no assurance that such capital will be available to the company 
factors affecting future operating results the company s annual and quarterly results have in the past and may in the future vary significantly due to a number of factors  including but not limited to new product introductions by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of the company s products shifts in demand for the company s products  gains or losses of significant customers  reduction in selling prices  inventory obsolescence  an interrupted or inadequate supply of semiconductor chips  the company s inability to protect its intellectual property  or loss of key personnel 
any unfavorable change in the foregoing or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
due to the factors noted above  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends of future periods 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfall until late in a fiscal quarter  which could result in even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
further  the company operates in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in volatility of the company s common stock price
