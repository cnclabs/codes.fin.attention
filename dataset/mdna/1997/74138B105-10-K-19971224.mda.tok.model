stac  inc stac or the company designs  develops  markets and supports high performance  easy to deploy  distributed business systems recovery software solutions for enterprise customers which implement the company s lossless data compression technologies 
in addition  through its majority owned oem networking products subsidiary hi fn  inc hi fn  the company designs  develops and markets semiconductor and software solutions to improve the efficiency  security and manageability of networks and to enhance the storage capacity of high capacity high speed storage devices 
stac also supports a remote access software suite  which is managed as a mature business unit 
the company intends to focus its development and marketing resources on the business segments it believes have the highest growth potential  and to continually evaluate its strategic objectives with respect to its remote access software business 
stac s products are sold through a variety of domestic and international channels 
stac s storage systems recovery software business is comprised of replica  a high performance  easy to deploy  distributed business systems recovery software product  which enables fast pc server replication and disaster recovery 
replica for netware was introduced in february  and replica for nt was made available in april the company intends to focus on the development of relationships with key system integration partners and is investing significant amounts of its product development  marketing and sales resources in replica and extensions to replica 
the company also develops and markets remote communications software which is comprised of reachout remote control software reachout  a remote access software suite which allows users to access a remote pc using another pc through the internet  or over isdn lines  modems or networks 
reachout works with microsoft corporation s windows nt  windows  windows x and dos operating systems 
hi fn is focused on improving the efficiency  security and manageability of networks by providing solutions in software and silicon to packet processing bottlenecks 
hi fn implements lossless data compression in software libraries and semiconductors  which are marketed and sold to manufacturers of routers  firewalls  remote access servers  isdn connectivity products  storage systems and printers 
currently  the majority of hi fn s sales are to a single storage system oem 
hi fn has also implemented data encryption standards in software and semiconductors for use with data compression to provide high performance  efficient and secure data transmission capabilities for its customers products 
hi fn s products are sold worldwide to oems both directly and through manufacturers representatives 
hi fn has licensed its data compression software to companies such as microsoft  cisco systems inc  netscape communications corporation  ascend communications inc  com corporation  and bay networks inc  all of which play significant roles in the development and marketing of internet and virtual private network products 
virtual private networks enable businesses to reduce their data communications costs by using the public networks  such as the internet  as an alternative to private leased data communication links 
in addition  hi fn  digital equipment corporation  and cisco have co authored a proposal to the internet engineering task force the ietf for the implementation of lossless data compression in the ip security ipsec protocol 
the ipsec is intended for implementation in a wide variety of networking equipment and will facilitate the deployment of virtual private networks 
however  there can be no assurance that these proposals will ultimately be adopted by the ietf  or that alternatives using other data compression technology will not be proposed and adopted 
stac has received royalties from microsoft and ibm corporation for licenses of its data compression technology since fiscal the company expects to receive million in royalties in the december quarter and million in the march quarter  after which the license agreements will be fully paid up 
on an after tax basis  the license fees from microsoft and ibm have contributed approximately million per quarter to net income 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this annual report 
fluctuations in annual and quarterly results may occur as a result of factors affecting demand for the company s products such as the timing of the company s and competitors new product introductions and upgrades 
due to such fluctuations  historical results and percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the company s results of operations and the percentage relationship of certain items to revenues during the periods shown 
unless otherwise indicated  references to years are to fiscal years which ended september revenues cost of revenues gross margin research and development purchased research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring operating income loss interest income income before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss revenues revenues increased by to million in compared to revenues  and increased by in to million compared to revenues of million 
the increase in and revenues was due to increased hi fn sales offset in part by a decline in software sales as discussed below 
net revenue millions software hi fn licenses total software sales  which are comprised of domestic and international sales and licenses through distribution  retailers  solution providers  oem and direct channels  accounted for million of revenues in  million of revenues in and million of revenues in software sales decreased by in from due primarily to declining sales of reachout which has reached a mature phase of the product life cycle and due to declining sales of stacker 
stacker sales continued to decline from comparable previous periods due primarily to the inclusion of disk compression in windows and dos and the availability of large capacity  low cost per megabyte hard disk drives 
the company has discontinued the sale of stacker products as of the end of fiscal these declines were partially offset by increased sales in the replica product line due to the new releases of that product discussed above 
software sales decreased by in from due primarily to declining sales of stacker as discussed above  offset by revenues from reachout and  to a lesser extent  from replica 
revenues from hi fn  stac s semiconductor subsidiary which develops  markets and sells semiconductors and software libraries derived from the company s data compression technology and from data encryption standards  were million in  million in and million in the increase in revenues in both and are due primarily to sales of the company s data compression coprocessors to providers of high speed networks and tape drives 
the majority of semiconductor sales in fiscal were from shipments of data compression coprocessors to quantum corporation  an oem producer of high speed high capacity tape storage devices 
royalties from licenses of stac s data compression technology to operating system vendors were million in and and million in in  and  royalty revenues were primarily from license agreements with microsoft and ibm  who are obligated to continue paying royalties under those licenses at the rate of million per quarter through december  and million in the march quarter 
international revenues  which are included above  are primarily from sales of software products 
international revenues were million  or of revenues in  and million  or of revenues in and the increase in international revenues in over is primarily due to sales of replica in the european marketplace 
international revenues were unchanged in from levels 
stac markets and sells to its european accounts from its office in the united kingdom and markets and sells to the other principal international markets through sales personnel in its san diego office and through relationships with distributors and resellers abroad 
gross margin cost of revenues consists primarily of stac s proprietary design semiconductors  which are manufactured by third party foundries for resale by stac  and of the user manuals  packaging  media and assembly associated with the company s software products 
gross margins were in  in and in the increase in s gross margin from that of was primarily due to the higher percentage of high margin semiconductor sales 
the decrease in s gross margin from that of was due to the increase of hi fn semiconductor revenues as a percent of total revenue 
semiconductor revenues have a lower gross margin than software revenues 
research and development the cost of product development consists primarily of salaries  employee benefits  overhead  outside contractors and non recurring engineering fees 
such expenses were million for  million for and million for the increases in product development in from that of and in from that of were due to the addition of personnel for development of new versions of reachout  development of the company s replica product line  and development of cd quickshare in the company expects to continue to invest in the development of products for which it believes there is a need in the market 
however  there can be no assurance that product development programs invested in by the company will be successful or that products resulting from such programs will achieve market acceptance 
purchased research and development for includes million recognized in connection with the october acquisition of california software  inc and the related investment in dynanet  inc 
purchased research and development for includes million related to the october acquisition of reachout from ocean isle software and million related to the march technology acquisition from crossware development corporation and rememory corporation 
selling and marketing expense selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits of sales  marketing and customer support personnel  and consulting  advertising  promotional and overhead expenses 
such expenses were million for  million for and million for the increase in marketing and sales expense in over that in was the result of the addition of personnel and program costs intended to create end user demand for the company s products 
there was no significant change in marketing and sales expense in from that of in july  the company reduced its sales and marketing personnel and  as a result  expects its sales and marketing expenses to decrease 
this reduction is consistent with the company s refocusing its sales and marketing efforts towards developing corporate enterprise customers  rather than individual end users  however  consolidated sales and marketing expenses are expected to remain the company s most significant ongoing operating expense 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries for administrative and corporate services personnel  legal  and other professional fees 
such expenses were million for  million for and million for the increase in expenses over those in are primarily due to the addition of management personnel and the costs of outside consulting services 
the decrease in expenses from those of was due to the inclusion in of a non recurring expense of million related to terminated acquisition activities 
restructuring charges as mentioned above  in july  the company reorganized its sales and marketing departments and recorded a restructuring charge of million 
the principal components of the charge include million for losses on property and equipment disposals  million for severance and employee related liabilities and million for lease termination and closure costs 
in may  the company closed its florida direct sales facility and consolidated us sales activities in its san diego  california headquarters 
in conjunction with the closure  the company recorded a restructuring charge to operations of million 
the principal components of the charge include million for lease termination and closure costs  million for intangibles written down  million for losses on property and equipment disposals  and million for severance and employee related liabilities 
interest income interest income was million in  million in and million in the increase in interest income in over that of and in over that of was primarily due to interest earned on higher investment balances as a result of net positive cash flow from operations 
the company invests the majority of its funds in tax exempt securities 
income taxes for  the company reported a provision for income taxes of million on income before income taxes of million  an effective tax rate of 
for  the company reported a provision for income for taxes of million on income before income taxes of million 
in  the company deducted purchased research and development of million for which  consistent with statutory guidelines  no tax benefit was recognized 
prior to the purchased research and development  the effective tax rate for was 
for  the company recorded a tax benefit on pre tax net income principally as the result of tax exempt interest earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the effective tax rates for both and are lower than the statutory federal and state rates due primarily to tax exempt interest earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
differences in effective tax rates among years is also affected by the proportion of earnings from interest income and foreign operations to total earnings and the different statutory tax rates associated with them 
quarterly trends and channel inventories the company historically has experienced significant fluctuations in its revenues and operating results  including net income  and anticipates that these fluctuations will continue 
the company operates with relatively little backlog of its software sales  and the majority of its software revenues each quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
consequently  if near term demand for the company s products weakens in a given quarter or if inventory of the company s products in the retail and distribution channels satisfies near term demand  the company s operating results for that quarter would be adversely affected 
in addition  when the company announces enhanced versions of its software products  the announcement may have the effect of slowing sales of the current version of the product as buyers delay their purchase 
quarterly results have been or may in the future be influenced by the timing of announcements or introductions of new products and product upgrades by the company or its competitors  distributor ordering patterns  product returns  delays in product development and licensing of the company s products and core technology 
in addition  new products typically have a lengthy evaluation period before any purchase is made 
hi fn s customers order semiconductor products to meet production schedules based on forecasts of demand for their products 
additionally  oems contract with third party manufacturers to build their products in large lot sizes to achieve manufacturing efficiencies 
as a result of these practices  oem semiconductor and finished product inventories can vary significantly depending on actual sales  the continuation of sales trends  and the timing of contractor manufacturing cycles with the result that demand for the company s semiconductor products may have cyclical increases and decreases 
seasonality the software industry has typically experienced some seasonal variations in demand  with sales declining somewhat in the summer months 
the company believes that its software sales are subject to similar seasonal variations which  when combined with the other factors described above  are likely to result in fluctuations in the company s quarterly results 
as a result  historical quarter to quarter comparisons should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
operating systems stac s reachout and replica products currently operate on a limited number of personal computer and network operating systems 
reachout supports microsoft windows nt  windows  windows x and dos  while replica supports windows nt and novell netware servers 
replica customers may require support of the unix operating system  which the company does not currently provide 
in addition  future versions of microsoft s windows operating systems may require significant changes to the company s products in order to maintain compatibility 
competition and risks associated with new product introductions the market for the company s products is intensely competitive 
increased competition could result not only in a decline in sales volume  but also in price reductions that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company began shipping replica back up and disaster recovery software for novell netware during the second quarter of fiscal and replica for windows nt in april replica competes with well established back up products from cheyenne software  inc  recently purchased by computer associates  inc  and seagate software  inc 
owned by seagate technologies  inc  legato systems  inc 
and veritas software corporation  all of which have established channels of distribution and installed customer bases 
resellers could choose not to sell replica over competitors products with the result that significant sales of replica could fail to materialize  or products similar to replica could be successfully introduced to resellers by the company s competitors 
in addition  microsoft s current operating systems incorporate back up functionality and future operating systems are expected to include some disaster recovery functionality 
also  replica is being introduced into sophisticated server environments and  while the company has invested significant resources in testing replica under a variety of conditions  configurations and circumstances  there are likely to be environments which have not been anticipated for which additional development of replica will be necessary 
the company s reachout product competes in the remote control software market against more established products such as symantec corporation s pcanywhere and traveling software  inc s laplink 
reachout also competes against remote access products from companies such as citrix  inc and shiva corporation 
further  microsoft could elect to incorporate remote control or additional remote access capabilities into its operating systems which are pre installed on most personal computers 
the company believes that the growth of the remote control market has decreased from the prior years growth rate and will have a negative effect on the company s ability to increase its remote control revenues 
the company s license agreement with ibm corporation grants ibm the right to implement  but not sublicense  the company s patented data compression technology in ibm hardware and software products 
also  microprocessor and chip set suppliers  customers and others could seek to expand their product offerings by designing and selling products using competitive data compression  or could rely on software implementations of data compression and data encryption  or use other technologies  any of which could render obsolete or adversely affect sales of hi fn s semiconductor and software products 
stock price volatility due to the factors noted above  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
shortfalls could be caused by shortfalls in revenues  timing of the receipt of technology license fees  and or increased levels of expenditures 
additionally  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in significant volatility of the company s stock price 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and marketable securities decreased by million to million at september  from that at september  the decrease was primarily attributable to cash used to purchase treasury stock of million  partially offset by cash generated from operations 
accounts receivable decreased by million to million at september  from that at september  working capital decreased by million to million at september  from that at september  during  the company paid million in dividends on its series a preferred stock 
the obligation to pay the preferred dividend terminated when the preferred stock was converted to common stock in november the company believes that existing cash balances and funds provided by operations will be sufficient to finance the working capital requirements of the consolidated companies for the foreseeable future
