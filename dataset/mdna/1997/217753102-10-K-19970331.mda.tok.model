the company s most advanced product in clinical development is integrilin tm antithrombotic injection 
in april  the company submitted a new drug application nda to the united states food and drug administration the fda seeking approval to market the integrilin tm product for use in helping to prevent acute cardiac ischemic complications in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca 
integrilin tm was studied in this setting in impact ii  a large  multi center phase iii clinical trial 
the company s worldwide partner for integrilin tm  schering plough corporation schering  submitted a filing for this indication in europe 
in february  the fda cardiovascular and renal drugs advisory committee the committee considered the company s filing in ptca 
the committee concluded that the impact ii trial of the integrilin tm product had shown positive results as an adjunct therapy in helping to prevent acute cardiac ischemic complications in patients undergoing ptca 
however  because the committee also decided that the results of the impact ii trial alone were not sufficient to forego the fda s customary requirement of two positive clinical trials prior to the approval of a new drug  the committee recommended against approval of integrilin tm at this time 
the company has received an action letter from the fda regarding the nda 
the not approvable letter identifies clinical and technical issues that need to be resolved  including the fda s conclusion that impact ii was not sufficiently robust as a single study to support approval 
in its letter  the fda noted that a study in unstable angina is ongoing and that the data should be provided which may add support to the findings of the impact ii study 
the company has notified the fda of the company s intention to file an amendment addressing the issues cited 
an amendment to the nda would need to include data from pursuit  a phase iii trial of integrilin tm for use in connection with unstable angina non q wave mi
