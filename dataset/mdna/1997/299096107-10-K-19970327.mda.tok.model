the business of the company is subject to national and worldwide economic and political influences such as recession  political instability  the economic strength of governments  and rapid changes in technology 
the company s operating results are dependent on its ability to rapidly develop  manufacture  and market innovative products that meet customers needs 
inherent in this process are a number of risks that the company must manage in order to achieve favorable operating results 
the process of developing new high technology products is complex and uncertain  requiring innovative designs and features that anticipate customer needs and technological trends 
the products  once developed  must be manufactured and distributed in sufficient volumes at acceptable costs to meet demand 
furthermore  portions of the manufacturing operations are dependent on the ability of suppliers to deliver components and subassemblies in time to meet critical manufacturing and distribution schedules 
constraints in these supply lines may adversely affect the company s operating results until alternate sourcing can be developed

any forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to risk of product demand  market acceptance  economic conditions  competitive products and pricing  difficulties in product development  commercialization  and technology  and other risks detailed in this filing

factors external to the company can result in volatility of the company s common stock price 
because of the foregoing factors  recent trends are not necessarily reliable indicators of future stock prices or financial performance
