overview hf bancorp  inc is a savings loan holding company 
its primary subsidiary  hemet federal savings loan  is a federally chartered savings loan which operates branch offices in riverside and northern san diego counties 
hfb was formed for the purposes of acquiring all of the stock of hemet federal savings loan upon that company s conversion from a mutual to a stock form on june  hfb had no operations prior to june  and  accordingly  the results of operations prior to such date reflect only those of the bank and its subsidiaries 
the company operates on a june fiscal year 
the company reported a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to net income of million during the prior fiscal year 
the decline in profitability primarily resulted from three factors a one time  million assessment by the fdic to recapitalize the saif 
a non recurring million charge to accrue expenses related to the termination of the company s defined benefit pension plan and its non qualified supplemental retirement restoration plan 
one time operating expenses associated with the integration of three branches purchased from hawthorne savings on june  and with the acquisition and assimilation of palm springs savings bank  with that transaction closing on september  saif assessment 
on september   the president signed into law the deposit insurance funds act of the funds act 
this legislation  among other things  imposed a special one time assessment on saif member institutions  including the bank  to increase the reserve ratio of the saif up to the federally mandated of covered deposits 
the fdic imposed a special assessment of basis points on saif assessable deposits held as of march   payable november   but accrued during the company s first fiscal quarter ending september the pre tax charge to the bank was million  which is deductible for both federal income and state franchise taxes 
the funds act also spread the financial obligations for the payment of the fico bonds across all saif and bif members  with bif deposits assessed at of the rate assessed against saif insured deposits 
full pro rata sharing of the fico payments between bif and saif members will occur on the earlier of january  or the date the bif and saif are merged 
the funds act also specifies that the bif and saif will be merged on january  provided no savings institutions exist as of that time 
as a result of the funds act  the bank s ongoing assessment rate for fdic insurance declined from basis points to basis points  excluding assessments in support of the fico bonds 
at june   the bank s assessable deposit base for fdic insurance totaled million 
the annualized savings resulting from the funds act therefore equates to approximately million pre tax 
defined benefit pension plan and retirement restoration plan terminations 
in the quarter ended june   the company s management and board of directors determined to terminate two retirement plans 
the defined benefit pension plan was a traditional pension program which provided employees with monthly retirement income based upon years of service and the employee s earnings during the sixty months prior to retirement 
this is the type of defined benefit program which has been terminated by many companies  including many of the company s competitors  over the past decade  in favor of defined contribution plans such as k programs 
the company s defined benefit pension plan cost the company approximately  per year in administrative costs for actuarial  trust  and audit support services  plus the periodic benefit expense recognition for retirement payments as calculated under sfas number employers accounting for pensions 
in contrast  defined contribution programs such as k plans can be provided at significantly lower administrative costs and are more portable than defined benefit plans 
the retirement restoration plan was a non qualified supplemental plan designed to compensate certain highly salaried employees for the impact of the wage caps under erisa  which are applicable to qualified plans such as the defined benefit pension plan 
other factors which influenced the company s decision to terminate the retirement plans included o the existence of the qualified esop plan  which generated  in periodic expense recognition during the fiscal year ended june  the combined expense of the terminated plans in addition to the esop placed the company s retirement benefits costs above peer institutions 
o the defined benefit pension plan investment assets had enjoyed significant returns during the past several years due to the rally in the capital markets 
these returns had reduced the funding shortfall associated with a plan termination 
continuation of the defined benefit pension plan would also have exposed those assets to reductions in value if the bull market experienced throughout most of the s reversed course 
o a significant number of employees from the hawthorne savings bank and pssb acquisitions would have entered the defined benefit pension plan on january   thereby increasing both the periodic expense recognition under sfas number and the cost of terminating the plan at some future date 
the company s management estimates the first year expense savings from the two retirement plan terminations at approximately  a figure which would have increased in future periods if the company continued to add employees and grant pay increases 
in addition  the final cost associated with the termination of the two retirement plans will not be ascertained until all of the plan assets have been distributed and all regulatory approvals have been obtained 
while the amount accrued represents management s best estimate of the total termination costs  various future events could produce an actual expense total either higher or lower than that accrued 
acquisition integration costs 
in fiscal  the company incurred significant non recurring operating costs associated with the integration of the three branches purchased from hawthorne savings bank and pssb  which included four branches in the coachella valley 
the one time costs included  but were not limited to  expenses for o computer systems conversion programming  testing  integration  and balancing o printing costs for replacement checks for customers o the write off of pssb assets not utilized in the continuing operation o overtime for staff involved in the integration and conversion efforts o telecommunications consulting  analysis  and design the hawthorne savings bank branch acquisition provided the company with  accounts representing million in deposits and a significant presence in the northern san diego county area 
the pssb acquisition brought the company a strong presence in the coachella valley  a net loan portfolio of million with a weighted average rate of  and a million deposit portfolio with a weighted average rate of 
since the two acquisitions  a significant percentage of the company s total revenues have been derived from the new markets  with the stronger property values and economic trends in those markets contributing to meaningful increases in loan production and average loan size  thereby bolstering the company s operating efficiency 
business strategy during fiscal  the company s management implemented several key strategies targeted at increasing long term shareholder returns while also enhancing the company s involvement in and contributions to the communities it serves 
the actions  which were also focused upon moving the company forward in its mission to evolve into a high performing  premier community bank  included o the aforementioned acquisitions  which provided opportunities for the company to prudently deploy some of its excess capital while also expanding into adjacent  and more vibrant  markets 
o the proliferation of some of the commercial banking products and services acquired via pssb into the other branches within the company s network 
these products and services included merchant bankcard  small business lending  and commercial demand deposit accounts 
o the extension of some of the historic hemet federal products and services into the new coachella valley branches  such as mutual fund and insurance product sales 
o the continued enhancement of the company s management team and board of directors  which included the appointment of richard s 
cupp as president  ceo  and director of the company and george p 
rutland as a director in july  these individuals bring many years of successful commercial and community banking experience to the company 
o the aforementioned termination of the two retirement plans 
o a continued focus on the company s efficiency ratio  with a series of efforts implemented to both enhance revenues and reduce operating costs 
examples of achievements in this regard during fiscal included expanded correspondent banking relationships with concomitant reductions in item processing costs and lost float  more sophisticated liquidity and cash management  renegotiated third party contracts  and replacement of under performing and higher cost vendors 
o aggressive management of the bank s portfolio of troubled assets  leading to expanded sales of foreclosed real estate in fiscal the company intends to implement additional steps to improve its financial performance during the upcoming fiscal year while continuing the long term strategy outlined above 
actions under consideration include alternative delivery channels  increased secondary market activity  enhanced capital utilization  product repricing  new services  and further modifications of the company s compensation and benefit programs 
however  there can be no assurance that any of such steps will be implemented  or if implemented  whether such implementation will improve the company s financial performance 
analysis of the results of operations overview the company reported a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended june   compared to net earnings of million during fiscal and a net loss of million during fiscal the decline in profitability during the most recent fiscal year stemmed from the significant  non recurring events described above 
excluding the charge for the saif recapitalization and the accrued expenses associated with the termination of the retirement plans  the company earned million  or per share in fiscal  an increase from earnings per share of in fiscal earnings in fiscal were also impacted by the initial amortization of the intangible assets see item analysis of financial condition intangible assets created in conjunction with the hawthorne savings bank branch purchase and the pssb acquisition 
a total of million in amortization expense associated with intangible assets was recorded in fiscal net income excluding the saif recapitalization charge  the expenses for the retirement plan terminations  and the amortization of intangible assets  analytically referred to as normalized tangible earnings  would have totaled million a significant improvement over prior fiscal year results 
net interest income net interest income is the net result of interest earned on loans  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities collectively interest earning assets interest paid on deposits and borrowings collectively interest bearing liabilities net hedging income or expense resulting from various off balance sheet positions net interest income is the single largest source of company earnings  consistent with the company s role as a financial intermediary 
net interest income is primarily affected by a 
the average volume  cash flow frequency  and repricing characteristics of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities b 
the absolute and relative levels and volatility of general market interest rates c 
the amount of non accruing loans and net non earning assets d 
the interest rate spread between the yields earned and the rates paid for the year ended june   net interest income totaled million  representing an increase of million  or  from million during fiscal net interest income in fiscal totaled million 
as detailed in the tables which follow  the significant expansions in net interest income achieved over the past two fiscal years primarily resulted from o the company s conversion to a public company at june   and the subsequent deployment of the million in capital raised o the purchase of the hawthorne savings bank branches in northern san diego county o the acquisition of palm springs savings bank o the gradual migration of the balance sheet towards one more representative of a community bank  combined with an expansion in the ratio of average loans to average deposits from in fiscal to in fiscal o a significant reduction in net hedging expense  as the company shifted its focus from purchasing securities hedged by off balance sheet positions to serving the household and small business needs of the communities in which it operates over the past three fiscal years  the company s net interest margin on average interest earning assets expanded from in fiscal to in fiscal to in fiscal reported net interest income in future periods will be favorably impacted by the conclusion of the amortization periods associated with losses on terminated interest rate swaps see item off balance sheet 
management intends to continue the company s emphasis upon serving its communities  thereby attempting to further improve the company s ratio of loans to deposits  which had climbed to at june  net interest income in future periods will also be favorably impacted by the company s success in providing expanded transaction account services to the households and small businesses located in its market areas 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will achieve future increases in its ratio of loans to deposits  or in its amount of transaction related deposit accounts

asset liability management asset liability management is often referred to as the management of interest rate risk irr 
interest rate risk and credit risk typically constitute the two greatest exposure factors for financial institutions 
the objective of irr management is to maximize the net income of the company while controlling the volatility of both net income and net portfolio value 
financial institutions are exposed to various types and sources of interest rate risk  including repricing risk 
this occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times and or at different magnitudes 
basis risk 
this risk stems from the divergent movement of various indices eg libor  year cmt underlying the repricing of a firm s assets and liabilities 
option risk 
this risk arises from the implicit options embedded in many financial products  such as a mortgage borrower s ability to refinance his loan when general market interest rates decline 
irr management focuses upon decisions to control or accept interest rate risk based on an understanding of the probabilities associated with the occurrence of various future scenarios 
stated another way  irr management encompasses the evaluation of the likely additional return associated with an incremental change in the irr profile of the institution 
as with credit risk  the complete elimination of interest rate risk would curtail the company s profitability  as the company earns its returns  in part  through effective risk management 
on the other hand  excessive interest rate risk would expose the company to potentially significant volatility in net income and market value  and possible regulatory response under safety and soundness considerations 
the company monitors its interest rate risk through an internal simulation model  various management reports  and the ots net portfolio value model 
the company employs a variety of tools to control its aggregate interest rate risk exposure  including both on and off balance sheet instruments see item management s discussion and analysis off balance sheet 
consistent with the static gap table displayed below  throughout fiscal  the company maintained a net liability sensitive position 
this means that  in aggregate  the company s sources of funding repriced faster and or of a greater magnitude than the company s assets 
this net liability sensitive position translates into expanded net interest income and average interest margins during periods of declining market interest rates 
conversely  this position presents the likelihood of constrained net interest income and average spreads during rising rate environments 
the following table presents the maturity and rate sensitivity of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of june  the static gap figures  as reflected in the following table  present the estimated difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repricing during future periods  adjusted for interest rate swaps

loan balances exclude non accrual loans 
static gap analysis such as that presented on the prior page provides only a limited  point in time view of the company s interest rate sensitivity 
the static gap analysis also does not reflect factors such as the magnitude versus the timing of future interest rate changes and asset prepayments  which are material to the company s cash flows due to its significant balance of mortgage related assets 
the actual impact of interest rate changes upon the company s net income and net portfolio value may differ from that implied by any static gap measurement 
in addition  the company s net interest income and net portfolio value under various future interest rate scenarios are affected by multiple other factors not embodied in a static gap analysis  including competition  changes in the shape of the treasury yield curve  divergent movement among various interest rate indices  and the speed with which interest rates change 
another means of identifying and quantifying interest rate risk is via the use of a computer simulation model that employs various mathematical techniques and business assumptions to value a company s financial position under current and multiple potential economic scenarios 
the company utilizes one such model internally  and compares its results to the interest rate risk management reports provided via the ots net portfolio value model 
net portfolio value refers to the estimated liquidation value of the company s financial positions  both on and off balance sheet  and therefore is not necessarily indicative of the value of the company as a going concern 
the information presented in the following table results from a lengthy series of assumptions about current and future economic  behavioral  and financial factors  including many factors over which the company has no control 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  prepayment rates on various loan portfolios ranging from to  prepayment rates on various mortgage related securities ranging from to  and a continuation of treasury rates as of june  under the constant interest rate scenario 
because of the inherent uncertainty regarding the accuracy of the assumptions utilized in both current and future periods  management can provide no assurance that the valuations presented in the following table are representative of what might actually be obtainable 
estimated net portfolio value of hf bancorp  inc at june  dollars in thousands estimated net portfolio value financial minus constant plus statement parallel interest parallel value rate shock rates rate shock assets     liabilities     off balance sheet   net portfolio value     a significant portion of the estimated increase in the net portfolio value of the company over its book value at june  derives from the bank s portfolio of low cost core deposits and from its portfolios of adjustable rate loans and securities  which were generally in high investor demand at june  conversely  the company s portfolios of fixed rate mortgage backed securities and callable agency debentures presented estimated market values below historical book values 
the above results of the computer modeling are directionally consistent with those indicated by the static gap table and the ots net portfolio value model 
the company is exposed to increases in general market interest rates and benefits from declines in general market interest rates primarily due to its portfolios of longer term  fixed rate  agency callable securities  customer residential mortgages  and mortgage backed securities  for which the company did not maintain a like amount of match funding at june  the results of the computer modeling also highlight the impact of the embedded options present in many of the company s mortgage related portfolios  whereby the portfolios amount of increase in value in declining rate environments is less than the amount of reduction in value in rising rate environments due to the ability and tendency of borrowers to refinance their loans  often without penalty  when general market interest rates fall 
during the year ending june   the company took a number of steps to reduce its sensitivity to increases in general market interest rates  including o the sale of million in long term  fixed rate mortgage backed securities o the development and marketing of additional core deposit products o the sale of a portion of fixed rate residential loan originations into the secondary market o the adoption of a loan origination program which encourages the generation of adjustable rate mortgages through favorable pricing to the consumer combined with incentives to the company s sales force o the introduction of new prime rate based adjustable rate loan lending products  including three different home equity lines of credit o the focus of secondary market loan and security purchases upon adjustable rate assets  or fixed rate assets with limited remaining lives provision for estimated loan losses implicit in lending activities is the risk that losses will occur and that the amount of such losses will vary over time 
consequently  the company maintains an allowance for credit losses by charging a provision for estimated credit losses to earnings 
loans determined to be losses are charged against the allowance for credit losses 
the company s allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to provide for estimated losses inherent in the existing portfolio  including commitments under commercial and standby letters of credit 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  management estimates the amount of potential loss for each loan that has been identified as having greater than standard credit risk  including loans identified as nonperforming 
loss estimates also consider the borrower s financial data and the current valuation of collateral when appropriate 
in addition to the allowance for specific problem credits  an allowance is further allocated for all loans in the portfolio based on the risk characteristics of particular categories of loans including historical loss experience in the portfolio 
additional allowance is allocated on the basis of credit risk concentrations in the portfolio and contingent obligations under off balance sheet commercial and standby letters of credit 
the company s provision for estimated loan losses declined from million in fiscal to  in fiscal  after totalling million in fiscal the fiscal reduction stemmed primarily from the following factors o a cessation in the decline in real estate values in the company s primary lending markets  with some markets demonstrating price appreciation during the most recent fiscal year o  in recoveries of prior charge offs o in excess of of the company s loan portfolio consisting of residential mortgages at june  the company has enjoyed a relatively favorable credit experience with home loans o only of the company s loan portfolio at june  was composed of credits that were either unsecured or secured by collateral other than real estate or deposit accounts o a continuing reduction in total classified assets commencing in the second quarter of fiscal see credit quality loan loss provisions in future fiscal years may be higher than those recorded in fiscal if the company succeeds in its strategic plan of expanding the loan portfolio in order to better serve the communities in which it operates and in order to better utilize the company s capital position 
the potential increase in future loan loss provisions may  however  be offset by the enhanced asset yields obtained via servicing household and small business credit needs 
other income expense other income has three major components non interest income from ongoing operations  such as savings fees  loan servicing income  and commissions earned from the sale of mutual funds and insurance related products income and expenses associated with foreclosed real estate and real estate held for investment  including provision for real estate losses  rental income from foreclosed properties while such are being marketed for sale  and operating costs for real estate including insurance  maintenance  and real property taxes gains and losses on sales of loan servicing  securities  and other assets and liabilities non interest income from loan operating fees increased from  during fiscal and  during fiscal to  during fiscal due to the impact of the two major acquisitions and the significant expansion in the company s loan portfolio 
savings fee income also increased significantly  from  in fiscal and  in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the volume of deposit accounts added via the two acquisitions and because of the company s successful marketing for additional deposit transaction accounts 
in addition  the company has benefitted from the closure of riverside county branches by major commercial banks 
the company s loss from real estate operations declined  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  as real estate values in the company s primary market areas had generally bottomed  and in some cases commenced improving  by the fiscal year 
the current fiscal year s results also compare favorably to the  loss from real estate operations reported in fiscal for information concerning the company s real estate development results  see subsidiary activities  below 
net gains on the sale of securities designated as available for sale increased from zero in fiscal to million in fiscal  as the company partially restructured its balance sheet to improve capital utilization  eliminate all mutual fund investments  and reduce interest rate risk see item management s discussion analysis asset liability management 
net gains on loans held for sale rose from zero in fiscal and fiscal to  in fiscal  as in fiscal the company commenced selling a portion of its residential fixed rate loan production into the secondary markets in order to manage interest rate risk 
in fiscal  the company commenced the amortization of the core deposit intangibles generated as a result of the two acquisitions 
a total of million in core deposit intangible amortization was recorded in fiscal  including twelve months of amortization for the core deposit intangible associated with the northern san diego county branch purchases and nine months of amortization for the core deposit intangible associated with the pssb acquisition 
subsidiary activities first hemet corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of hf financial corporation  in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank 
first hemet corporation provides trustee services for the bank  is engaged in real estate development  and receives commissions from the sale of mortgage life insurance  fire insurance and annuities 
for the fiscal years ended june    and  first hemet corporation had million  million  and million in total assets  respectively 
at june   first hemet corporation maintained the following real estate development assets vista bonita 
this is a residential lot subdivision located in hemet  california  which first hemet corporation is seeking to sell on a bulk basis 
at june   first hemet corporation s net investment in this property was  which has been reduced by a valuation allowance of  mayberry estates 
this real estate investment consists of six one half acre residential lots located in hemet  california 
first hemet corporation is actively marketing the property for bulk sale 
at june   first hemet corporation s net investment in this project was  which has been reduced by a valuation allowance of  because of first hemet corporation s real estate development activities  ots regulations require the bank to deduct from regulatory capital its investment in first hemet corporation  which at june  amounted to million 
following the sale of the above two real estate investments  the company intends to discontinue real estate development activities for the foreseeable future 
general administrative expenses general administrative expenses excluding the saif special assessment and the costs associated with the defined benefit and retirement restoration plan terminations increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  after rising million between fiscal and fiscal the significant increase in fiscal stemmed from two sets of factors the many non recurring operating costs borne by the company to integrate the two acquisitions  including data processing conversion expenses  check printing costs  and the write off of acquired assets not utilized in the ongoing business of the company the ongoing costs of operating nineteen branches  a headquarters facility  and a stand alone loan center  versus twelve branches and a headquarters facility  as a result of the two acquisitions and the significant expansion in credit originations generated by the company over the most recent fiscal year salaries and related expenses constitute the greatest portion of the company s general administrative expenses 
during fiscal  salaries and employee benefits costs excluding the termination costs for the two retirement plans rose to million from million in fiscal and million in fiscal while this increase in cost has primarily resulted from the growth of the company  management has taken the following steps to control salaries and benefits costs in future fiscal years o the aforementioned termination of the defined benefit pension plan and the retirement restoration plan o a requirement that employees pay a greater percentage of their medical insurance costs o the elimination of redundant positions during fiscal following the integration of pssb with the company occupancy and equipment expenses were relatively constant in fiscal and at million 
these expenses increased to million in fiscal due to the addition of seven full service branches and the establishment of the loan center 
similarly  data processing costs increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal before rising significantly to million in fiscal  as the company s volume of customer deposit accounts alone expanded from less than  at june  to nearly  at june management remains intently focused upon controlling general administrative expenses  as highlighted by the termination of the two retirement plans as of june  in the coming fiscal year  management intends to pursue other initiatives aimed at reducing the company s efficiency ratio to a level more in line with its peer institutions 
these initiatives include  but are not limited to  alterations in the company s delivery of products and services  further modifications to benefits plans  a transition to a greater reliance upon incentive based compensation  and outsourcing functions currently performed internally 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to implement these initiatives or  if implemented  that they will have the desired effect of significantly reducing general administrative expenses 
income taxes the company s nominal combined federal and state tax rate is approximately 
differences between this rate and the effective tax rate for each fiscal year arise from o certain operating expenses for which there is limited federal and or state tax deductibility o revisions to tax expenses recognized for prior fiscal years o adjustments to valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets under sfas number see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
analysis of financial condition overview the company reported total assets of million at june  this represented an increase of million  or  from total assets of million at june  during fiscal  total assets increased million  or  from total assets of million at june  the increase in total assets in fiscal was largely generated by the pssb acquisition  while the rise in total assets in fiscal primarily resulted from the purchase of the three branches from hawthorne savings bank 
the overall composition of the company s assets changed significantly in fiscal  with a reduction of the excess liquidity present at the conclusion of the prior fiscal year  a significant increase in the loan portfolio resulting from both enhanced origination volume and expanded loan purchases  and a migration in the securities portfolio to more interest rate sensitive investments 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  the evolution toward more transaction accounts continued within the deposit portfolio 
these aggregate balance sheet changes were reflective of the company s strategic plan of developing into one of southern california s premier community banks 
securities portfolio the company maintains a portfolio of investment securities in order to serve as a source of liquidity  to generate income primarily net interest income  and to contribute to the management of interest rate risk 
note and note of the consolidated financial statements included in this form k set forth information concerning the composition  estimated fair value  and maturity distribution of the securities portfolio at june  and at june   securities totaled million  down from million at june   as in fiscal the company worked to redirect cash flows from the security portfolio into customer loans in order to bolster net interest income  serve the company s expanded market area  and better utilize the bank s strong risk based capital position 
general trends in the security portfolio during fiscal included the focus of new purchases on adjustable rate securities or securities with limited durations  such as seasoned agency fixed rate balloon securities  where the then outstanding entire principal balance is payable at a given date one or more years in the future 
this focus for new purchases was complemented by the sale of longer term fixed rate instruments  the liquidation of all of the company s mutual fund investments  and the sale of all of the company s treasury securities 
the focus upon more interest rate sensitive securities resulted from the company s aggregate interest rate risk profile  which was a net liability sensitive position throughout the fiscal year 
the treasury securities represented a less advantageous investment than other alternatives given their relatively low yields  the bank s high liquidity  and the bank s strong risk based capital position 
the securities portfolio at june  included three significant concentrations million in callable agency bonds 
these securities are fixed rate  and present the issuer with the option to prepay the debentures at various points in time or on various periodic cycles eg quarterly 
the issuer would typically prepay the bonds when current market interest rates for bonds with similar remaining terms fall below the cost of the company s securities 
therefore  in purchasing these securities  the company obtained comparatively higher interest rates in exchange for forfeiting any significant capital appreciation above par in the event general market interest rates decline 
million in gnma adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
these securities reprice annually based upon a margin over the one year treasury constant maturities index as published by the federal reserve 
the company has attempted to relatively uniformly distribute the annual repricing dates of these securities in order to avoid exposure to interest rate movements at any one point in time 
million in fnma fixed rate  thirty year mortgage backed securities with a weighted average coupon rate of and a weighted average remaining maturity of months carried in the held to maturity portfolio 
substantially all of the company s securities other than the callable debentures consist of securities backed by mortgages 
the cash flows  total return  and final maturities associated with mortgage backed securities can be significantly impacted by the speed at which the underlying mortgages prepay 
mortgages tend to repay faster as interest rates fall  and slower as interest rates rise 
as a result  the company may be subject to prepayment risk resulting from greater funds available for reinvestment at a time when available yields are lower 
conversely  the company may be subject to extension risk resulting in lower cash flows being available for reinvestment at a time when available yields are higher 
while the company undertakes efforts to diversify these risks  such as by purchasing multiple pools of securities with different coupons and interest rate reset dates  the company remains exposed to volatility in the fair market value  net interest income  and total returns stemming from its mortgage backed securities 
the company intends to concentrate future securities purchases upon adjustable rate and low duration securities as part of its interest rate risk management program 
while such securities may often present lower initial yields than are available via longer term  fixed rate instruments  the company s management believes that shareholder value is best maximized over time by effectively managing interest rate risk 
however  there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of adjustable rate and low duration securities at acceptable prices will be available to the company in future periods 
loans at june   the company reported total net loans receivable of million 
this represented an increase of million  or  over million in net loans receivable at june  in conjunction with the pssb acquisition  million in net loans were added in fiscal the company s loan originations have increased quite significantly over the past several years  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase in originations has stemmed from the rebuilding of the company s retail via internal offices and wholesale via mortgage brokers loan production networks 
in addition  loan purchases expanded from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal  as the company s management moved to better deploy the bank s strong risk based capital position

in conjunction with the pssb acquisition  the company acquired a small business loan portfolio and commercial business lending expertise  which management has been leveraging throughout the branch system since the conclusion of the acquisition 
the company has been marketing a more comprehensive small business service line during the last six months of fiscal  which includes not only commercial lines of credit  but also demand deposit account analysis  integration with third party payroll service providers  merchant bankcard services  deposit collection via courier  and safe deposit boxes 
in fiscal  the company commenced originating home equity line of credit heloc loans under three separately priced and marketed programs or lower loan to value credits with commitments up to  loan to value credits with commitments up to  or lower loan to value credits with commitments over  these revolving credit lines are priced based upon the wall street journal prime rate  reprice monthly  provide annual fees after the first year  present early closure fees  and are originated at no cost to the consumer in the case of the first two programs 
in addition  all heloc s receive credit reviews at least annually 
at june   the company had million in heloc credit commitments outstanding 
the company also commenced originating consumer loans for autos  boats  and recreational vehicles for its own account during fiscal in prior periods  the company referred such business to third parties in exchange for a fee 
in fiscal  the company s management intends to evaluate the provision of credit cards to its consumer and business customers  either of its own account or via a third party  in order to offer a complete community banking product line to its clients 
the company continues to originate construction  apartment  and commercial real estate loans 
a majority of the company s construction loans are associated with the construction of single family residences 
the company also offers fully amortizing loans for the purchase of land and developed housing lots 
in fiscal  management intends to pursue the origination of a greater volume of high credit quality apartment and commercial real estate loans in order to better utilize the bank s strong risk based capital position and high available liquidity 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in generating such originations 
in addition  commercial real estate and multifamily loans  even though prudently underwritten  are generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than one to four family mortgage loans

since the company lends primarily in southern california  its real estate loan collateral is concentrated in this region 
this concentration is considered when determining the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan and lease losses alll 
commencing in the second half of fiscal  the company began pursuing the purchase of residential loan pools which included at least some properties in northern california  as a means of starting to diversify its geographic concentration 
however  despite these efforts  the vast majority of the company s real estate collateral was located in riverside and san diego counties at june  the following table sets forth at june   the amount of gross loans receivable  including non performing loans  and whether such loans have fixed or adjustable interest rates

during the past fiscal year  the company has emphasized the origination and purchase of loans tied to adjustable rate indices other than cofi in order to diversify its portfolio and because of concerns regarding the long term status of the cofi  as the number of savings institutions in the th district continues to decline in conjunction with merger and acquisition activity 
as the determination of the cofi becomes concentrated in fewer institutions  funding decisions by a relatively few large institutions could potentially further reduce the correlation of cofi to changes in general market interest rates and the company s cost of funds 
credit quality general 
although the company s management believes that non performing loans are generally well secured and reserved  other real estate owned is properly valued  and potential losses are provided for in the alll  there can be no assurance that future deterioration in economic conditions or collateral values will not result in future credit losses and associated charges against the company s income 
in regards to real estate owned via foreclosure  although all such properties are being actively marketed  the company s management cannot predict when these properties will be sold or what the terms of sale will be when they are sold 
it is the company s general policy to maintain recent within eighteen months appraisals for all foreclosed properties 
non performing assets 
at december   gross non performing assets  which include non performing loans  real estate acquired via foreclosure  and repossessed consumer assets  totaled million 
this represented an increase of million from total non performing assets of million at june  during fiscal  non performing assets decreased million  or  from a total of million at june  the significant increase in non performing assets in fiscal resulted primarily from loans originated by pssb prior to its acquisition 
approximately million of the million in non performing loans at june  were originated by pssb prior to the acquisition 
in conjunction with its due diligence of pssb  the bank s management and third party consultants identified the weaknesses in the pssb credit portfolio and required pssb to recognize an additional million in loss reserves immediately prior to the consummation of the acquisition

since the pssb acquisition  the company s management has diligently worked to reduce the classified asset total through various means including aggressive collection efforts  foreclosure with subsequent property sales  and settlement of troubled loans for less than the principal balance owed 
total classified assets have declined from million at september  immediately following the pssb acquisition to million at june   as detailed in the following table

the company adopted sfas number  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan as amended by sfas number  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures as of july  and recognized no impact upon adoption 
the company has historically defined a loan as impaired when it meets one or more of the following criteria o it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement o the loan is ninety or more days past due o the loan is placed on non accrual status although less than ninety days past due o a specific valuation reserve has been allocated against the loan o the loan has been classified as substandard or worse by an internal credit review process at june   the company had impaired loans totaling million  which have related specific reserves of million 
of this million  million was fully current in regards to the timely payment of principal and interest 
total impaired loans at june  were million 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans during the twelve month period ending june  was million 
the increase in impaired loans during fiscal was disproportionately represented by the portfolio of loans originated by pssb prior to its acquisition  as highlighted in the following table which presents information as of june  pssb originations prior to other acquisition originations total dollars in thousands impaired loans with a current paid to date number of loans principal balance    specific reserves impaired loans without a current paid to date number of loans principal balance    specific reserves  total impaired loans number of loans principal balance    specific reserves  the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in this form k present additional information concerning the company s impaired loans 
intangible assets the purchase of three branches from hawthorne savings and the acquisition of pssb each generated intangible assets 
the following tables provide information concerning the initial amount of such intangible assets  their periodic amortization against income  and their current balances as of june  under ots regulations  intangible assets reduce regulatory capital  resulting in lower capital ratios than would otherwise be the case

the total payments due under the contract were capitalized as an adjustment to the core deposit intangible associated with the pssb acquisition  as the potential cost of the contract  which existed prior to the acquisition  was included in the initial valuation of the core deposits acquired 
the payments due under the contract were not capitalized at the date of acquisition due to uncertainty regarding whether the contract would be triggered  ie whether the executive would remain with the company 
this adjustment to the core deposit intangible will be amortized over the remaining initial life of the core deposit intangible 
because the payments are taxable to the executive  the company can deduct the payments for tax purposes on a faster schedule than they will be recognized for book reporting purposes  thus generating a deferred tax liability under sfas number deposits the company reported total deposits of million at june  this represented an increase of million  or  over total deposits of million at june  the increase in deposits stemmed primarily from the pssb acquisition 
total deposits at june  were million  with the increase during fiscal primarily associated with the purchase of the three hawthorne savings bank branches 
the following table presents the deposit activity of the company for the periods indicated 
for the fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands beginning balance   branch deposits purchased   customer deposits   customer withdrawals   withdrawals in excess of deposit   interest credited on deposits   net increase in deposits   ending balance   at june   the company had outstanding million in certificate of deposit accounts in amounts of  or more  maturing as presented in the following table 
average nominal amount rate dollars in thousands maturity period three months or less  over three through six months  over six through months  over months  total  the bank is currently eligible to accept brokered deposits  and has in place agreements with two investment banking firms to obtain brokered deposits should the need for such funds arise and should the relative pricing of such funds compare favorably to alternative sources of liquidity 
however  at june   the bank had no brokered deposits outstanding 
the company s mix of deposits has changed over recent years 
for example  at june   non interest bearing checking accounts constituted of total deposits 
by june   this proportion had increased to 
transaction account non certificate products comprised of total deposits at june   following the hawthorne savings bank branch acquisitions  which were heavily populated with certificate accounts 
this percentage increased to at june  consistent with the objective of serving as a premier community bank  the company in recent years  and particularly in fiscal  has emphasized business operating accounts  consumer demand deposit accounts  hour telephone banking  atm access  and ach services  thereby gradually evolving the deposit portfolio toward a reduced concentration in certificate of deposit products  which are typically more price sensitive than transaction accounts 
the company intends to continue encouraging the migration of its deposit portfolio in the coming fiscal year  taking advantage of market dissatisfaction with the service levels provided by large and merging competitors while also improving shareholder returns through lower cost and more stable funding 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in this regard 
borrowings at june  the company had million in total borrowings  composed of two standard term advances from the fhlb san francisco 
this was a decline of million from the million outstanding at june   as the company during fiscal prepaid a million advance  at no prepayment penalty  whose rate exceeded the bank s marginal return on liquid investments at the time 
from time to time  the bank utilizes other types and sources of borrowings  including reverse repurchase agreements and putable fhlb advances 
during the upcoming fiscal year  the bank s management intends to employ a broader range of wholesale borrowings in an effort to increase the bank s net interest income  control interest rate risk  and fund the potential balance sheet expansion associated with the more effective deployment of the company s capital 
the following table presents certain information regarding the company s borrowed funds at or for the periods ended on the dates indicated at or for the year ended june dollars in thousands fhlb advances average balance outstanding during period    maximum amount outstanding at any month end during period    balance outstanding at end of period    weighted average interest rate during period weighted average interest rate at end of period other borrowings average balance outstanding during period  maximum amount outstanding at any month end during period  balance outstanding at end of period weighted average interest rate during period weighted average interest rate at end of period total borrowings average balance outstanding during period    maximum amount outstanding at any month end during period    balance outstanding at end of period    weighted average interest rate during period weighted average interest rate at end of period liquidity liquidity is actively managed to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet the ongoing needs of both the company in general and the bank in particular 
liquidity management includes projections of future sources and uses of funds to ensure the availability of sufficient liquid reserves to provide for unanticipated circumstances 
for the bank  the primary sources of liquidity are o deposits o principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed  and investment securities o retained earnings o fhlb advances o other borrowings  including reverse repurchase agreements for the bank  the primary uses of funds include o loan originations o customer drawdowns on lines of credit o loan purchases o customer withdrawals of deposits o interest paid on liabilities o operating expenses the bank s investment portfolio is structured to provide an ongoing source of cash from scheduled payments and anticipated prepayments from mortgage backed securities  in addition to cash flows from periodic maturities  typically from securities with balloon final payments 
the company s strategy over the past year has been to reinvest available monthly cash flows  to the extent economically and operationally feasible  into new whole loan originations and purchases  in order to bolster net interest income and better utilize the bank s strong risk based capital position 
in the coming year  the company s management intends to pursue the acquisition of short term  unsecured lines of credit from the institution s correspondent banks  as an additional means to provide for contingent liquidity needs 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in securing such lines of credit 
at june   the bank maintained untapped borrowing capacity at the fhlb san francisco in the amount of million 
in addition  due to the company s relatively low loan to deposit ratio of at june   the company maintained significant excess collateral in both loans and securities  collateral which is available for either liquidation or secured borrowings in order to meet future liquidity requirements 
at june   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  compared to million at june   and million at june  the figure at june  represented a more normalized amount  as the figures at the two prior year ends were each inflated by particular events 
at june   the company had recently acquired the three branches from hawthorne savings bank and had not yet completed the longer term deployment of cash received 
at june   the company had just accomplished its initial public offering  and had also not yet completed the longer term investment of the proceeds 
it is management s intention  while ensuring adequate cash availability for operating needs  to constrain cash and cash equivalent balances in favor of higher yielding assets  subject to meeting all regulatory liquidity requirements 
ots regulations currently present two liquidity requirements 
the key requirement is based upon cash  cash equivalents  and certain short term investments equaling at least of deposits plus short term borrowings 
the bank s regulatory liquidity ratio for the month of june  was  placing the bank in compliance 
liquidity needs for hfb on a stand alone basis are met through available cash  periodic earnings  and cash flows from its investment portfolio 
capital resources the bank s position as a well capitalized financial institution under the pca regulatory framework is further enhanced by the additional capital present at the hfb holding company level 
the value of the additional capital in the holding company was highlighted during june   when hfb downstreamed million in capital to the bank in preparation for the financial impact of the retirement plan terminations 
at june   the consolidated gaap capital position of the bank was million  while the consolidated gaap capital position of the company was million 
despite the presence of capital in excess of current regulatory requirements  the company does not presently intend to evaluate the initiation of cash dividend payments until the core profitability of the company improves and the company displays a more regular stream of improved earnings per share 
off balance sheet over the past decade  the company has utilized a variety of financial instruments to control its interest rate risk and manage its net interest margin  including off balance sheet transactions such as interest rate agreements including swaps  caps  and floors 
the company originally entered into its existing off balance sheet positions to synthetically adjust the duration of the company s liabilities to more closely match that of its assets 
on july   the bank terminated four interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million  invoking a termination fee of million which  for accounting purposes  is being amortized to interest expense over the individual remaining contract lives of each swap 
during the twelve months ended june   the company amortized million of the deferred loss to interest expense  and charged interest expense for million related to current existing interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the comparable figures for the prior fiscal year were million and million  respectively 
the year to year decrease in recognition of the deferred loss stemmed from the conclusion of the amortization periods for two of the terminated swaps during fiscal the end of the amortization period associated with another terminated swap will occur in fiscal  with the accounting impact of the final terminated swap finishing in fiscal the conclusion of these amortization periods will result in the company s reporting a reduction in interest expense and effective cost of funding  all else held constant

unlike industrial companies  the company s assets and liabilities are nearly all monetary in nature 
consequently  relative and absolute interest rates present a greater impact on the company s performance and condition than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
the company s operating costs  however  are subject to the impact of inflation  particularly in the case of salaries and benefits costs  which typically constitute approximately one half of the company s total general administrative expenses

o sfas number earnings per share o sfas number disclosure of information about capital structure o sfas number reporting comprehensive income o sfas number disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information the above statements are primarily related to the disclosure and reporting requirements applicable to the company 
as such  the company s management does not believe that the adoption of these statements will have a significant impact upon the company s financial condition or results of operations
