the owner participant has the right to require the company or the company s designee to purchase the owner participant s beneficial interest 
this right cannot be exercised by the owner participant until january and continues for a period of four years thereafter 
the company s obligation  if the right is exercised  would be to take title to the beneficial interest in the trust  or find another investor  suitable to the noteholders who financed these facilities  to take such title 
in either case the company s obligations as lessee under the lease would not change 
the company would be obligated  whether or not the right is exercised  to make payments called for under the existing lease of approximately million annually through the year  a payment of million in january and nominal annual payments of  through in addition  the company is obligated to make contingent rental payments based upon the consumer price index 
there are presently several alternatives available to the owner participant and the company relative to the additional contingent rental payments 
the earliest potential payment of approximately million could be due as early as january if the owner participant exercises the right to sell the facility to the company 
if this right is not exercised  and the owner participant does not elect the one time payment of contingent rent of approximately million  the determination of the additional contingent rental payments will be based upon movements in the consumer price index during the period september to september with an annual cap on the consumer price index movement of per year

the company plans to issue a call for redemption on april  of the outstanding convertible preferred stock 
although an additional dividend is payable as a premium for a call of such stock  the terms of the redemption are such that  given the range in which the company s common stock has traded recently  holders of such convertible preferred stock would likely find it more advantageous to convert the preferred shares into common shares prior to redemption  in which case no additional dividend premium would be paid by the company 
the conversion or redemption of such convertible preferred stock will eliminate the preferred dividend payment on such convertible preferred stock following the date of redemption or conversion  which will have a positive effect on the company s cash position  and increase common stock outstanding by approximately million shares
