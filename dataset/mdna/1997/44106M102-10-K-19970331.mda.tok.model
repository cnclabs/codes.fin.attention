the company completed its initial public offering of shares and acquired an additional hotels on august  since it has been recently formed and has limited historical financial data  the company believes it is meaningful to an understanding of its present and ongoing operations to discuss the company s pro forma results of operations as well as its historical results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
pro forma results and percentage relationships set forth in the financial highlights section and in such financial statements may not be indicative of the future operations of the company 
historical and pro forma results of operations year ended december  versus pro forma year ended december  the company s assets increased to million as of december  from million at december  the increase primarily resulted from three hotel portfolio acquisitions completed during in march and april of  the company acquired courtyard by marriott r hotels for million and residence inn r by marriott hotels for million 
in may  the company acquired wyndham garden r hotels for million 
these acquisitions were funded through the use of cash on hand  borrowings on the company s line of credit  and the net proceeds form the offering of  shares in april total revenues in were million versus pro forma revenue of million 
total revenues were comprised principally of base and percentage rent of million and ff e reserve income of million in versus million and million  respectively  in the pro forma period 
the company s results of operations in are reflective of the growth in the number of owned hotels to  from at year end the leases for the company s hotels at december  call for base rent of million annually  versus million for the hotels owned at december  during  the company earned revenue of approximately million share in percentage rents from its portfolio of courtyard hotels  reflective of continued increases in total hotel sales at these properties 
total expenses in were million  including interest expense and depreciation and amortization of million and million  respectively  versus pro forma expenses of million  including depreciation and amortization of million 
a portion of the hotels purchased in were financed with proceeds from the company s line of credit which was ultimately repaid with prepayable floating rate mortgages 
such debt financing in gave rise to the million of interest expense referred to above  versus zero for pro forma  when the company did not use third party debt 
the substantial increase in the number of hotels owned by the company has also proportionately increased the company s general expense levels  including depreciation and amortization and general and administrative expenses 
net income in was million per share and cash available for distribution for the period was million per share  based in both cases on average outstanding shares for the period of  this compares with pro forma net income of million per share and cash available for distribution of million per share  based in both cases upon  outstanding shares 
this growth in cad is primarily related to the effects of the company s hotel acquisitions and related financing activity as well as growth in percentage rent to million in from million in the pro forma period 
during april  the company completed an offering of  common shares of beneficial interest raising net proceeds of approximately million to fund its acquisitions and more than doubling its equity capitalization and shares outstanding 
cash flow provided by used for operating  investing and financing activities was million  million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  february  inception through december  total revenues from inception through december  were million  which included base and percentage rent of million and ff e reserve income of million 
total expenses for the period were million  including interest expense and depreciation and amortization of million and million  respectively 
net income for the period was million per share and cash available for distribution for the period was million per share  based in both cases on average outstanding shares for the period of  from inception until completion of its initial public offering on august   the company was a owned subsidiary of hrp and was initially capitalized with million of equity and million of debt 
the debt was provided by hrp at rates which were lower than the market rates which the company would have paid on a stand alone basis 
accordingly  the company does not believe that its results of operations while it was a wholly owned subsidiary of hrp are comparable to subsequent periods 
cash flow provided by used for operating  investing and financing activities was million  million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  pro forma year ended december  the pro forma results of operations assume that the company s formation transactions  the initial public offering of shares and the acquisition and leasing of the hotels and related transactions all occurred on january  on this pro forma basis  total revenues would have been million principally base and percentage rents of million and ff e reserve income of million 
total expenses would have been million including depreciation and amortization of million and general and administrative expenses of million 
net income would have been million or per share  and cash available for distribution would have been million or per share  based in both cases upon  shares outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of cash to fund its dividends and day to day operations is the base and percentage rent it receives 
base rent is paid monthly in advance and percentage rent is paid either monthly or quarterly in arrears 
this flow of funds from rent has historically been sufficient for the company to pay dividends and meet day to day operating expenses 
the company believes that its operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet its operating expenses and dividend payments 
in order to fund acquisitions and to accommodate occasional cash needs which may result from timing differences between the receipt of rents and the need to pay dividends or operating expenses  the company has entered into a line of credit arrangement was with dlj mortgage capital  inc dljmc 
the line of credit is for up to million  all of which was available at december  drawings under the line of credit are secured by first mortgage liens on certain of the company s hotels 
funds may be drawn  repaid and redrawn until maturity  and no principal repayment is due until maturity 
the line of credit matures on december   however  upon request and subject to certain terms and conditions  the company has the right but not the obligation to convert amounts outstanding at maturity  if any  into an amortizing mortgage loan due on december  interest on borrowings under the line of credit are payable until maturity at a spread above libor  and interest during the extended term  if any  will be set at market rates at the time the loan is extended 
during  subsidiaries of the company issued million of commercial mortgage backed securities notes in an unregistered a offering 
the notes are non recourse notes sold to the public and secured by the company s subsidiaries assets including residence inn by marriott r and wyndham garden r hotels 
the notes carry interest that floats with one month libor plus a spread and are due december   but may be prepaid by the company at any time without penalty 
in connection with this issuance of notes  the company entered into interest rate cap agreements for million notional amount with a major financial institution the cap counterparty which limit the company s maximum interest rate exposure to on this debt 
the company expects to use existing cash balances  borrowings under the line of credit and or net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future hotel acquisitions 
to the extent the company borrows on the line of credit  the company will explore various alternatives in both the timing and method of repayment of such amounts 
such alternatives may include incurring long term debt 
on december   the company s shelf registration for up to million of securities  including debt securities  was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission sec 
an effective shelf registration enables hpt to issue specific securities on an expedited basis by filing a prospectus supplement with the sec 
on january   the company acquired a room full service hotel in salt lake city  utah  for million 
the hotel is leased to wyndham hotel corporation and has been rebranded as a wyndham r hotel 
the company s net cash funding for this acquisition was approximately million for which it used cash then on hand  which was generated primarily from the notes offering 
although there can be no assurance that the company will consummate any debt or equity security offerings  the company believes it will have access to various types of financing in the future  including debt or equity securities offerings  with which to finance future acquisitions 
seasonality the company s hotels have historically experienced seasonal differences typical of the hotel industry with higher revenues in the second and third quarters of calendar years compared with the first and fourth quarters 
this seasonality is not expected to cause fluctuations in the company s rental income because the company believes that the revenues generated its hotels will be sufficient for the lessees to pay rents on a regular basis notwithstanding seasonal fluctuations 
inflation the company believes that inflation should not have a material adverse effect on the company 
although increases in the rate of inflation may tend to increase interest rates which the company may be required to pay for borrowed funds  the company has a policy of obtaining interest rate caps in appropriate circumstances to protect it from interest rate increases 
in addition  the company s leases provide for the payment of percentage rent to the company based on increases in total sales  and such rent should increase with inflation
