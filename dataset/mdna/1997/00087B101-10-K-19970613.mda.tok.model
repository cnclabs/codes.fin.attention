results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal operating income increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  as a result of higher sales and gross profit margin  despite additional costs relating to the startup of new branch operations 
operating earnings at acrs and hcs were particularly strong compared to fiscal operating losses and non recurring costs associated with the opening of five branches in fiscal amounted to more than  net income also increased significantly  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal year  with higher interest costs offset by a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
sales increased  from million to million  in fiscal compared to fiscal same store sales at the branches in operation in the first quarter of fiscal increased in both fiscal and  with the balance of the increase in fiscal attributable to sales from fcs  eti  three branches of tsi purchased or opened in late and a second branch of vsi in memphis

the gross margin percentage at each of the company s newest operations  eti and fcs  is higher than the overall average  because of minimal hvacr equipment sales during fiscal at these companies 
in the hvacr industry  the profit margin on sales of equipment  such as condensing units  furnaces and heat pumps  is generally less than on sales of parts and supplies 
in addition  eti provides engineering services in connection with sales of its control systems  and is able to command a higher gross margin on its sales with such value added services 
lfi  which manufactures most of the products that it sells  also obtains a much higher gross margin on its sales than the company s wholesale operations  but because only two months of lfi s operations were included in the company s fiscal results  this factor had little impact on the company s overall margin in fiscal selling  general and administrative costs sg a as a percentage of sales declined to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal with payroll costs representing and of sg a expenses and of sales in fiscal and  respectively  the company focuses on increasing the sales volume of each of its branch operations as a means to generate higher gross profit without a proportional increase in number of employees or amount of non payroll expenses 
however  sg a expenses as a percentage of sales are generally high during the first year of a new branch operation as sales volume gradually increases 
the costs associated with opening new branches caused sg a expenses to remain at a higher percentage of sales in fiscal than will be expected as such branches become more seasoned 
additionally  the company recorded a non recurring charge of  during fiscal for performance based compensation pursuant to the employment contract of its chief executive officer 
beginning in fiscal  the company earned commission revenue from a supplier by providing warehousing and shipping services to another distributor of the supplier 
this arrangement has been modified by the supplier such that revenues in calendar will be earned at a rate approximately equal to of the rate in calendar net energy services income increased from fiscal to fiscal as the company continued to provide services on a month to month basis to its remaining customer  following the expiration of its energy services contract in management does not expect to negotiate another contract with the customer  but the customer is partially dependent on the company for the proper operation of its hvacr systems

see liquidity and capital resources  below 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that a further reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was appropriate given expectations of higher future taxable income and  as a result  recorded an additional tax benefit of  in april  the company acquired the assets and liabilities of ach supply  inc ach  a wholesale distributor of hvacr products with two branch operations in the los angeles area

fiscal compared to fiscal operating income declined  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  because of lower gross margins on sales  startup costs associated with the opening of new branch operations  and increased inventory shrinkage

because tsi and vsi sell substantially more hvacr equipment than other products  and because their primary equipment supplier provides incentives to its distributors to induce a greater volume of sales at lower gross margins  their sales tend to depress the company s consolidated gross margin percentage 
in addition  the increase in janitrol equipment sales at hcs  as described above  reduced hcs s gross margin percentage by almost in fiscal compared to the gross margin percentage at acrs also declined in  as the company gained market share in part by negotiating bulk sales to customers at low margins of products that could be shipped directly to the customer from the manufacturer

current assets increased from to  principally in accounts receivable and inventory 
accounts receivable represented days of gross sales at the end of fiscal  compared to days of sales in receivables at the end of fiscal because of slow sales in february and extended payment terms that were provided to certain customers in fiscal of the million increase in inventory   was attributable to an increase in pre season shipments of air conditioning equipment received by acrs from its primary supplier  and million was located at operations started up or acquired in fiscal the remainder of the increase in inventory was acquired in anticipation of greater sales than the preceding year

the company made capital expenditures of million in fiscal  of which  was for land in las vegas on which the company intends to construct an office warehouse to replace its existing leased premises  and  was for leasehold improvements  equipment and vehicles for new branches 
the remainder of capital expenditures was principally for the addition or replacement of vehicles under capital leases 
the purchase price of the assets and liabilities of chs is estimated at million of which million will be financed by the bank under the new revolving credit facility described above  and million will be financed by the seller 
the company expects to conclude the acquisition of chs in the second quarter of fiscal in addition  the increased facility should provide the funds necessary to finance the expected growth of existing operations in fiscal management is engaged in discussions to sell the land that it owns in las vegas and in temple  texas to buyers who would construct buildings meeting the company s specifications and lease the completed facilities to the company under long term leases 
the purchase of the las vegas land was partially financed by the seller  whose note matures in september the company has approximately million in tax loss carryforwards and million in tax credit carryforwards 
such operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will substantially limit the company s federal income tax liabilities in the near future 
certain provisions of the internal revenue code code regulate the amount of additional stock that the company could issue without resulting in a change in ownership control  as defined in the code 
should such a change in control be deemed to occur  the company s ability to utilize its operating loss and tax credit carryforwards would be severely restricted 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality the company s sales volume and  accordingly  its operating income vary significantly during its fiscal year 
the highest levels of sales occur during the times of the year when climatic conditions require the greatest use of air conditioning  since the company s operations are concentrated in the warmer regions of the united states 
accordingly  sales will be highest in the company s second quarter ending august  and will be lowest in its fourth fiscal quarter 
the acquisition of chs  which is based in denver  may offset some of the company s existing seasonality 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
generally  manufacturer price increases attributable to inflation uniformly affect both the company and its competitors  and such increases are passed through to customers as an increase in sales prices
