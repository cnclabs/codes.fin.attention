item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the section entitled risk factors 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net revenues  certain consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated 
september  net revenues gross profit income from operations income before income taxes net income net revenues 
the company s net revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal net product revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal the increase in net product revenues in and was primarily a result of increases in commercial product revenues 
the decrease in net product revenues in was due to decreased commercial product revenues combined with a continued decrease in the company s military business 
license fees and technology transfer revenue from aisin seiki co  ltd 
aisin was million in and declined by  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the company does not expect this license agreement and manufacturing relationship with aisin to extend beyond february commercial product revenues  driven by increased unit sales  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal increases in unit volumes in each period resulted from stronger demand for the company s products primarily in the video multimedia  communications and data processing markets 
the company s commercial product average selling prices remained flat from to  but decreased by during the company expects the average selling prices of its commercial products to continue to decrease over time 
the company s military product revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and decreased to million in fiscal the decrease in military product revenues between and was a result of a unit volume decrease which was partially offset by an increase in average selling prices 
the decrease in product revenues between and was due to a unit volume decrease combined with an decrease in average selling prices 
on july  the company announced that it would discontinue its military hybrid product 
this product line accounted for  and of product revenues in  and  respectively 
orders for these discontinued products will be accepted through mid with last shipments from the factory expected through q  sales of dieletric isolation products represented approximately of the company s net product revenues in fiscal and in the process for manufacturing dielectrically isolated integrated circuits is more complex than processes for junction isolation bipolar manufacturing  and the number of foundries that have the capability to produce dielectrically isolated semiconductor wafers is limited 
the company has been informed that its existing dielectric isolation foundry will discontinue supplying this technology in late the company is currently developing an alternative source for this technology 
the loss of this foundry prior to locating a second source or developing alternate technology would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
export revenues were  and of net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in export sales was primarily the result of the development of japanese  taiwanese and korean markets for the company s products 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
gross margin 
the company s gross margin decreased from in to in and decreased slightly to in the decrease in gross margin from fiscal to resulted from reductions in average selling prices and increases in unfavorable manufacturing yield variances associated with third party foundry services 
the decrease in gross margin from fiscal to resulted from continued reductions in average selling prices combined with increasingly unfavorable manufacturing yield and overhead variances and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
manufacturing yield variances are primarily associated with third party foundries while overhead variances are predominantly due to capacity utilization 
while the company is working on programs to reduce these manufacturing variances  there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter similar difficulties in the future  and gross margin may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal the increases in research and development from to was primarily the result of costs associated with additional employees and consultants and  to a lesser extent  increased expenditures for mask sets  silicon and other materials 
the decrease in research and development expenses in was due to lower spending on prototype materials  consulting services and contract services 
the company expects to incur higher absolute research and development expenses in the future  although these expenses are expected to remain relatively constant as a percentage of net revenues 
there can be no assurance  however  that net revenues will grow at the same rate as the anticipated research and development expenses 
marketing  sales  general and administrative expenses 
marketing  sales  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased an additional to million in fiscal for  selling and administrative expenses included added compensation expenses for additional personnel  increased sales commissions due to increased sales  increases in the level of advertising expenses  and  higher absolute marketing  sales  general and administrative expenses due to reporting and other requirements of a public company 
in  selling and administrative expenses increased due to added compensation expenses for additional personnel  increased sales commissions due to increased sales and increases in the level of advertising expenses 
in  selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to costs related to the company s new administrative offices 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in the increase of interest income in each year resulted from investing proceeds from the company s initial public offering in october in cash equivalents and short term investments 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
provision for taxes on income 
provisions for taxes on income for fiscal  and were lower than the statutory rate principally due to the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards offset by alternative minimum taxes  state taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
at september   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  that expire in the years through in addition  the company had federal general business credit carryforwards of approximately  that expire in the years through and foreign tax credit carryforwards of  that expire in through under certain provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the availability of the company s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation if it should be determined that there has been a change in ownership of more than of the value of the company s stock 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting future results elantec s operating results have been  and in the future may be  subject to fluctuations due to a wide variety of factors including the timing of or delays in new product and process technology announcements and product introductions by the company or its competitors  competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in the mix or markets in which products are sold  availability and costs of raw materials  reliance on subcontractors  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  industry wide wafer processing capacity  political and economic conditions in various geographic areas  and costs associated with other events  such as underutilization or expansion of production capacity  intellectual property disputes  litigation  or environmental regulation 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has been subject to significant economic fluctuations at various times that have been characterized by rapidly fluctuating product demand  periods of over and under capacity  and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
a material change in industry wide production capacity  shift in industry capacity toward products competitive with the company s products  rapidly fluctuating demand  or other factors could result in a rapid decline in product pricing or unit volumes which could adversely affect the company s operating results 
from time to time  the company has experienced production difficulties that have caused delivery delays and quality problems 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience manufacturing problems and product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  changes to its process technologies  ramping production  installing new equipment at its facilities and constructing new facilities in milpitas  california 
the company has initiated an extensive production expansion at its primary manufacturing facility in milpitas  california 
the expansion  when completed  will result in a significant increase in fixed and operating expenses 
these additional expenses could reduce gross margins 
specifically  the company would anticipate incurring substantial operating costs and depreciation expense relating to the expanded facility before production of substantial volume is achieved 
if revenue levels do not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expense levels  or if the company is unable to achieve gross margin greater than or comparable to the company s current products  the company s future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
additionally  the project faces a number of substantial risks including  but not limited to  project termination  delays in construction  cost overruns  equipment delays or shortages  manufacturing start up or process problems  or difficulties in hiring key managers and technical personnel 
new products  process technology and start up costs associated with the milpitas wafer fabrication facility will require significant research and development expenditures 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner  that new products will gain market acceptance or that new process technologies can be successfully implemented 
if the company is unable to develop new products in a timely manner  and to sell them at gross margins at least comparable to the company s current products  the future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
part of the company s future bipolar product development strategy may include the development of an alternative form of silicon on insulator soi technology called bonded wafers 
the company currently believes that  if successful  the bonded wafer technology could provide technologically advanced products at a lower cost than the current dielectric isolation complementary bipolar technology 
however  there can be no assurance that bonded wafer technology can be successfully accomplished in a timely manner or that it will provide the desired improvements over the company s current technology 
significant delays or cancellation of the development of the bonded wafer technology and or manufacturing problems associated with transferring the company s current product line to this technology could have a material adverse affect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  delays or cancellation of the development of this technology could adversely affect the company s new product development program 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
in recent years  there has been a growing trend of companies to resort to litigation to protect their semiconductor technology from unauthorized use by others 
the company believes its products do not infringe upon any valid patents 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s position in these matters will prevail 
there can be no assurance that additional future claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights will not be asserted against the company 
the intellectual property claims that have been made  or may be asserted against the company in the future  could require that the company discontinue the use of certain processes or cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products 
additionally  the company may incur significant litigation costs and damages to develop noninfringing technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms or to develop noninfringing technology without a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing process 
although the company believes that its activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
there can be no assurance that regulatory changes or changes in regulatory interpretation or enforcement will not render compliance more difficult and costly 
any failure of the company to control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances  or otherwise comply with environmental regulations  could subject it to significant future liabilities 
the company s common stock has experienced substantial price volatility and such volatility may occur in the future  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of the company  the companies in the semiconductor industry or in the markets served by the company  or announcements by the company or its competitors regarding new product introductions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies stock in particular 
these factors may adversely affect the price of the common stock 
the company has initiated a year remediation plan which is expected to make the company s operating and ancillary systems year compliant 
this plan includes implementing financial application software that is year compatible 
the software has been purchased and the project is expected to be complete during fiscal the costs of implementing such a plan are not expected to be material to the company s operating results 
however  failure to implement the year remediation plan prior to the year could have a material adverse affect on the company 
liquidity and capital resources from fiscal through fiscal  the company financed its operations primarily from cash provided by operating activities and lease financing 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal resulted primarily from net income of million and depreciation of million  offset in part by increased working capital  principally from increased accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal resulted primarily from net income of million and depreciation of million  offset in part by increased working capital  again principally from increased accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal resulted primarily from net income of million and depreciation of million  offset in part by increased working capital  principally from increased inventories and decreased deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash provided by investing activities was million in the company s investing activities in fiscal was principally the purchase of property and equipment 
in addition to property and equipment purchases  million of net cash was invested in available for sale investments in in  purchases of property and equipment were more than offset from net sales of available for sale investments of million 
cash purchases of property and equipment totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in at september   there were outstanding commitments for capital expenditures of approximately million 
the company plans to spend approximately million on capital expenditures during fiscal  primarily on expanding manufacturing capabilities in milpitas  california 
net cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal financing activities in fiscal were primarily repayments on capital lease obligations and long term debt 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal in october fiscal  the company raised net proceeds of approximately million by issuing common stock in its initial public offering 
this financing activity was partially offset by payments on long term debt during of million  primarily on long term notes and capital leases 
in  net cash used in financing activities was million due to repayments on capital lease obligations and long term debt 
at september   the company had working capital of million and cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
at september  the company also had non revolving lease credit lines for up to million that can be utilized to finance up to of certain capital equipment 
the non revolving lease lines of credit expire in december and march three  to year capital leases have been negotiated under the lines 
at september    was outstanding  and approximately  remained available under the lines 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents  its current line of credit and cash from operations will be sufficient to support its operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
any major change in the nature of the company s business  such as the acquisition of products  the design of products not currently under development or the need for significant unplanned capital expenditures  could change the company s capital requirements 
to the extent the company requires additional cash  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to the company  or at all
