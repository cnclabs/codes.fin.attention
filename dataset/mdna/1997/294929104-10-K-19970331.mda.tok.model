item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of the company s operations the company s principal income producing asset is an interest in hda in which it is a co managing partner 
hda owns el comandante  the only licensed thoroughbred racing facility in puerto rico  which it leases to ecoc  and of the capital stock of galapagos  which leases and operates a race track in the dominican republic 
hda formed s e in november to own and operate the television stations  sold a interest in s e to paxson in august and sold the remaining to paxson in january the company also owns all of the outstanding stock of vjc  an inactive company and a former applicant for licenses to own and operate a thoroughbred racing and wagering facility in virginia 
see item introduction 
overview of hda s operations substantially all of hda s revenues through were derived from rent paid by ecoc pursuant to the el comandante lease see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company and item el comandante lease 
commencing in  hda began to generate revenues from the dominican republic racing operations of galapagos  principally consisting of commissions on wagering for races held at v centenario and el comandante simulcasted races  and from television operations of s e 
hda revenues in also reflect the sale of a interest in s e 
ecoc had significant growth in revenues from through which resulted largely from the conversion  commencing in november and completed in  of over otb agencies to an on line computerized wagering system  the increase in otb agencies to at december  and the television broadcasting of all of its races 
until november  ecoc televised only sunday races 
with the automation of the otb agencies  ecoc began televising all of its races throughout puerto rico via commercial television 
a total of agencies were on line at december  and applications for additional agencies are in various stages of processing 
at the same time that it was automating the otb agencies  ecoc expanded its betting program to offer one additional daily double wager and four additional exacta wagers  and in added another daily double wager 
the otb agencies are able to participate in the expanded betting program  including win place bets which could not be made at agencies prior to automation 
in august ecoc introduced a jackpot pool pool pote which is paid out only in the event a single bettor wins the regular pick six pool 
four percent of the regular daily pool pay out is added to the pool pote if no single bettor wins 
whenever the pool pote reaches million as it did in july  the regulations of the racing board require  to be paid out as part of the regular pick six pool wager on the next sunday or holiday following the date the pool pote reaches million 
ecoc has asked the puerto rico racing board racing board to permit two new wagers in  a trifecta and a pick pool wager 
the racing board has not yet responded to ecoc s request 
the automation of otb agencies  the expanded betting program  the pool pote  and the daily broadcasting of races resulted in substantial increases in wagering from million in to million in as betting page opportunities became more attractive and more convenient to wagering patrons 
wagering decreased to million in and remained at the same level in ecoc s management attributed the decrease to i regulatory changes in otb agents commissions and ii more frequent  and therefore lower  payouts in on el comandante s pick six jackpot wager which caused bettors to shift to other wagers for which ecoc receives lower commissions 
in february ecoc increased its race days from four to five days a week and at the same time reduced the number of races per day  resulting in an increase to approximately races per week from approximately races per week 
the average daily wagering handle decreased  as expected  but the extra day compensated for the decrease 
the extra race day per week provides an extra pick pool wager each week  this wager is favored by bettors and provides a higher commission to ecoc than other wagers 
consequently the mix of wagers in improved ecoc s percentage of the total wagers it received as commissions 
as a result ecoc increased its commissions by million in with no significant increase in handle 
ecoc management is forecasting a modest million increase in handle of which million is from el comandante live racing and million from simulcasted races to the dominican republic 
the forecasted increase in live racing handle is based on an expected approval in of two new bets  the trifecta and pick pool bet 
the increase in simulcasting handle is expected from wagering at additional otb agencies to be developed by galapagos in the dominican republic

on march   the company acquired an additional profits interest in hda
