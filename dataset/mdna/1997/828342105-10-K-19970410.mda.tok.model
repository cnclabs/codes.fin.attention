net cash used in investing activities was  as the company acquired three businesses in net cash generated from financing activities in was  the company s principal credit facility is a  revolving credit agreement with a bank  of which the full amount had been drawn as of december  borrowings under this facility are based upon a borrowing base which is defined as of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventories 
this credit facility extends for a period of three years to april  with interest at prime defined as the wall street journal southwest edition prime rate  at december  
borrowings under this facility are guaranteed by the company s chairman of the board and his spouse 
there are no material long term commitments associated with the company s capital expenditure plans 
consequently  the company has a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of such expenditures as circumstances warrant 
in addition to the revolving credit facility  the company has a  term note from the same bank 
at december    was outstanding and interest is at prime 
repayment of this term note begins in april  with the final payment being due in june this note is also guaranteed by the company s chairman and his spouse 
at december   the company s borrowings on its revolving credit facility exceeded the borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable and inventories by approximately  as a result  the company is in violation of the loan agreement with the bank

 of these debentures have been converted by the holders through march  the company s chairman has also converted  of debentures which had been purchased in a separate offering which was made pursuant to regulation d

while the company has experienced losses since its inception in  such losses in the earlier years were due to the low volume of annual revenues consistent with the start up nature of the company s business
