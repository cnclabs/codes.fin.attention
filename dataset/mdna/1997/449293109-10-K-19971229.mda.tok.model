introduction the company s net revenues in recent years have increased due to a variety of factors  including acquisitions and increased sales volumes in both existing and acquired business lines 
the april wedco acquisition occurred during a cyclical downturn in the plastics industry and followed a period during which the domestic management of wedco was focused upon the sale of wedco and related matters 
the company believes as a result of these factors  wedco experienced declines in the utilization of machinery and equipment which resulted in the underabsorption of certain overhead costs in several of wedco s domestic facilities 
consequently  during its fiscal year ended march   wedco experienced a decline in both revenues and gross margins in comparison to its historical performance 
as part of the strategy initiated with the wedco acquisition  the company acquired psi which solidified the company s domestic petrochemical size reduction market share and added management expertise  continued to emphasize its european petrochemical processing business through acquisition and expansion of the company s distribution business and established a domestic sales force 
the company also implemented a plan of consolidation involving the closure of three domestic petrochemical processing plants 
the houston  texas and long beach  california plants were closed during the second quarter of fiscal and the maywood  illinois plant was closed during the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the above initiatives and the reduction of expenses  overall operating results of the company s size reduction businesses have improved as compared to the combined results of wedco and psi for the year earlier periods prior to these companies being acquired by the company 
the company s revenue is classified within two categories oilfield services and petrochemical processing 
oilfield services revenues include revenues derived from i exploration sales and services  new tubular goods inspection  ii production sales and services reclamation  reconditioning and inspection of used tubular goods and sucker rods  iii corrosion control services coating of tubular goods and sucker rods  and iv other sales and services oilfield engine sales and services in canada 
petrochemical processing revenues include revenues derived from i grinding petrochemicals into powders size reduction  including other ancillary services and grinding equipment manufacturing  ii compounding sales and services  which includes the manufacture and sale of concentrates  and iii distributing plastic powders 
distribution revenues primarily include the operating results of the ico polymers companies and the distribution operations of rotec and verplast  all of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the company and operate in europe 
these operations utilize the company s size reduction and compounding facilities to process petrochemical products prior to sale 
revenues are recorded as the services are performed or  in the case of product sales  upon shipment to third parties 
cost of sales and services is primarily comprised of compensation and benefits to non administrative employees  occupancy costs  repair and maintenance  electricity  equipment costs  supplies and purchased raw materials 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to the sales and marketing  executive management  accounting  management information systems  human resources and other administrative employees of the company  other sales and marketing expenses  communications costs  systems costs  insurance costs and legal and accounting professional fees 
liquidity and capital resources the following are considered by management as key measures of liquidity applicable to the company as of september cash and cash equivalents   working capital   current ratio debt to capitalization 
to 
to cash and cash equivalents increased  during fiscal year  primarily the result of the june issuance of the  senior notes  due senior notes and cash generated by operating activities 
these cash inflows were partially offset by cash used for investing activities  including acquisitions made during the year  and dividends on the company s common and preferred stock 
the company s working capital and current ratio has increased from  and  respectively  at september  to  and  respectively  at september  these improvements are primarily due to the issuance of the senior notes which also resulted in an increase of the company s debt to capitalization ratio from 
to to 
to the company issued the senior notes on june  and received proceeds  net of offering costs  of approximately  the debt matures june  and interest is payable on june and december of each year commencing december  during fiscal  the company used a portion of the proceeds to retire approximately  of existing indebtedness and used  in connection with the verplast acquisition 
capital expenditures totaled  during fiscal of these capital expenditures   related to the oilfield services business segment and  related to the petrochemical processing segment 
the remaining  were general corporate expenditures 
petrochemical processing expenditures totaling  related to the capacity expansion of the company s laporte  texas compounding facility see item business petrochemical processing 
the company believes that the remaining proceeds of the senior notes offering  cash flow from operations  and borrowing under the company s credit facility will be sufficient to fund its anticipated capital expenditure requirements 
cash flows from financing activities increased to sources of  during fiscal from uses of  in fiscal the increase is primarily due to the issuance of the senior notes  offset by an increase in debt repayments and common stock dividends 
during the three years ended september   the company acquired sixteen businesses 
these acquisitions required significant investment by the company in cash  company common stock issued to the former owners of the acquired businesses and indebtedness effectively assumed by the company 
many of the changes of the september  balance sheet from september  are a result of these acquisitions 
the company anticipates it will continue to seek acquisitions in the future 
as of november   the company had approximately  in additional borrowing capacity available under various credit arrangements 
of this amount   is available under the company s domestic credit facility and the remainder is available under various foreign facilities

   year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues 
consolidated revenues increased  or during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase resulted from an increase in both oilfield services revenues and petrochemical processing revenues 
oilfield service revenues increased  or during fiscal versus revenues improved within all oilfield service business lines and such growth  rather than being due to acquisitions  was primarily driven internally 
as a result of an increasing domestic rig count which increased demand for the company s services  exploration sales and services revenues increased  or in fiscal compared to a majority of this increase resulted from an increase in revenues for the company s houston  texas facility which benefitted from increased drilling activity in the gulf of mexico 
production sales and services revenues increased  or driven by modestly higher average oil and gas prices in fiscal versus much of these revenue gains were due to increased demand for the company s services in the west texas and canadian markets 
corrosion control sales and services revenues increased  or in fiscal compared to this improvement resulted from increased drilling activity  the success of the company s new product lines and  to a lesser extent  higher average sales prices 
other sales and services consist of revenues generated by the company s canadian subsidiary  shearer  relating to the reconditioning and selling of engines used in connection with oil well pumping equipment 
petrochemical processing sales and services revenues increased  or in fiscal compared to this increase is almost entirely due to the timing of the fiscal and petrochemical processing acquisitions 
since all of these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  the company included  in the consolidated statement of operations  the acquired companies results of operations only from the date of acquisition 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements which includes unaudited pro forma financial information 
during the year ended september   sales to a single customer within the petrochemical processing segment accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated revenues 
costs and expenses 
gross profit calculated as total revenues minus total costs of sales and services  as a percentage of revenues in fiscal declined to from in within the oilfield service business  gross profits as a percentage of revenues improved due to increased sales volumes which resulted from increased utilization of operating facilities and  to a lesser extent  modest average price improvements within some of the company s oilfield services markets  without a proportionate increase in costs and expenses 
the overall decline in gross profits  as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal as compared to is attributable to the increase in compounding sales and distribution of material revenues which generate lower gross profits as a percentage of revenues 
generally  gross profits as a percentage of revenues are higher within the company s size reduction operations  which are performed on a toll basis  as compared to the company s oilfield service operations 
conversely  the gross profits as a percentage of sales of the company s concentrate manufacturing included in compounding sales and services revenues and distribution of material revenues tend to be significantly lower  due to the significant raw material cost component included in these revenues 
selling  general and administrative costs increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was due to the timing of the fiscal and acquisitions and to a lesser extent  higher legal expenses and higher corporate administrative expenses  offset by lower bonus expenses 
also  fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses included capital based state franchise taxes which were not included in fiscal selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease was also the result of the fiscal and acquisitions and the increase in distribution revenues resulting from the establishment of the ico polymers companies in europe 
these factors have resulted in the company s corporate expenses being spread across a greater revenue base 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase resulted from additions of property  plant and equipment and goodwill due primarily to the acquisitions made during fiscal and operating income 
operating income improved to  in fiscal from an operating loss of  in fiscal oilfield services operating income increased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal improvement within the oilfield service business was driven by the increase in revenues and gross profit margins and the  charge for inventory writedowns in fiscal a similar inventory charge was not required in fiscal petrochemical processing sales and services operating income improved to  in fiscal from a loss of  in this increase in petrochemical processing operating income resulted from the timing of the fiscal and petrochemical processing acquisitions  the charges relating to sfas impairment  and non recurring compensation arrangements  which were unnecessary in fiscal general corporate expenses declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decline resulted primarily from non recurring and other litigation charges  and non recurring compensation arrangements  in fiscal  neither of which was required in fiscal additionally  legal expenses and corporate administrative expenses were higher and bonus expenses were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal interest income expense 
net interest expense was  in fiscal compared to net interest income of  in fiscal the change is due to the issuance of the  senior notes  the utilization of cash balances and the assumption of debt in connection with the fiscal and acquisitions 
the company s interest expense in fiscal and future years will be significantly higher than in fiscal  due to the june issuance of senior notes 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate increased to during fiscal compared to in fiscal this change was the result of an increase in non deductible goodwill amortization which  unlike fiscal  was not offset by a reversal of the company s valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
as non deductible goodwill amortization continues to increase  resulting from future acquisitions  the company would anticipate that future effective tax rates  likewise  would increase 
the company s effective tax rate will also vary as a result of the mix of domestic and foreign pre tax income since  currently  the company s domestic effective tax rate is higher than the average effective tax rate of foreign operations 
see note segment and foreign operations information to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has for tax return purposes  and  in net operating and capital loss carryforwards  respectively  which expire between and  and  in investment  alternative minimum and other tax credit carryforwards 
all of the tax credits are expected to expire unused  except for  in alternative minimum tax credits  which have no expiration 
foreign currency translation 
the fluctuations of the us dollar against the dutch guilder  swedish krona  british pound  italian lira  canadian dollar  and the french franc have impacted the translation of revenues and income of the company s european petrochemical processing operations over the past two years 
the table below summarizes the impact of guilder  pound and krona currency fluctuations ie material fiscal currency exposures during the twelve months ended september  compared to the exchange rates used to translate the five months ended september  net revenues  operating income  pre tax income  net income  gains and losses from the translation of certain balance sheet accounts are not included in determining net income  but are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity 
as a result of the dollar s fluctuation against applicable foreign currencies  stockholders equity decreased by  in fiscal year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues 
revenues increased  or  in the fiscal year ended september  from the same period in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of the company s entry into the specialty petrochemical processing business via the acquisitions of wedco april and psi july exploration revenues decreased  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a shift in the classification of the services provided to customers within the company s lone star  texas facility 
historically  the lone star facility provided mostly new pipe inspection 
during late fiscal  the company began providing mostly used tubular goods inspection at this facility 
accordingly  in fiscal  lone star revenues were classified as production services revenues versus fiscal  when these revenues were included in exploration services revenues 
after eliminating the effect of this reclassification  fiscal revenues increased  or as compared to fiscal demand for exploration services is affected by domestic drilling activity 
the domestic rig count averaged for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to during fiscal  an increase of 
in addition  the company s exploration revenues increase in fiscal was due in part to the full year effect of the acquisition of spinco in june production revenues increased  or  in fiscal from fiscal  primarily due to the reclassification of lone star  texas revenues discussed above 
after eliminating the effect of the reclassification of lone star revenues  production services revenues increased  or 
the increase resulted from generally high oil prices in fiscal which increased the demand for production services 
oil prices ranged from a high of per barrel to a low of per barrel during fiscal compared to a high of per barrel and a low of per barrel during fiscal revenues from corrosion control services increased  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase resulted primarily from greater demand for the company s services in the louisiana and west texas corrosion control markets 
revenues from other services decreased  or  from fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of a decline in oilfield engine sales and reconditioning revenues in canada  due to a slowdown in oilfield activity in western canada 
the remaining decrease was the result of an equipment sale recognized in fiscal  with no comparable sale in fiscal costs and expenses 
cost of sales and services as a percentage of net revenues increased to during fiscal versus for the same period in fiscal such costs exclude sales  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  interest costs and expenses  other income and expense and the following fiscal operating expenses non recurring compensation arrangements  non recurring litigation and writedown of inventories 
within the oilfield service business  costs of sales and services increased to calculated as costs of sales and services divided by revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the gross margin decline within the oilfield services segment was due to in order of magnitude a softening of prices in the houston inspection and west texas coating markets  the recognition of million in product sales during fiscal which carried gross margins greater than the company s traditional oilfield sales and services  and the reclassification of certain employee expenses to cost of sales during fiscal which had been recognized as selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal the reclassification of the employee expenses was based upon the applicable employees job functions 
the effects of lower margins in the company s oilfield service business were partially offset by the higher margins generated by the specialty petrochemical processing business 
this business which  in fiscal  primarily provided size reduction and compounding services on a toll basis  generally generates higher gross margins as a percentage of net revenues than the company s oilfield services business 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased from  during fiscal to  during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal these changes are primarily due to the wedco and psi acquisitions which increased both revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses  but had the effect of lowering these costs as a percentage of revenues 
the company also experienced decreases in the following sg a categories for fiscal versus fiscal in order of magnitude insurance costs  moving expenses primarily related to several employee relocations in and payroll costs due to the reclassification of certain employee costs explained above 
these lower costs were offset by  in expenses relating to litigation costs incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal in relation to certain baker hughes litigation see item legal proceedings 
depreciation and amortization increased from  for the year ended september  to  for the year ended september  the increase was primarily due to increases in property  plant and equipment and goodwill due to the wedco acquisition as well as capital expenditures made during the year 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which the company adopted in the first quarter of fiscal sfas no 
established accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles  and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used and for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of 
the new statement requires the value of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles  and goodwill to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if this change in circumstances or other initial indication has occurred  the next step in determining whether an asset has been impaired is performed using the expected future undiscounted cash flows of assets  grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows  compared to the carrying value of those assets 
if the undiscounted cash flow value is less than the net carrying value  the amount of impairment is then measured by comparing the discounted cash flows with the corresponding carrying values of the assets evaluated 
the company s previous policy was to evaluate the realizability of long term assets on an aggregate basis based on undiscounted cash flows 
the company accumulated cash flow information at the lowest asset grouping levels for which there were identifiable cash flows 
these levels were represented by separate operating locations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  based on the consolidation plans  the company was required to consider impairment which resulted in a write down of long lived assets of  the sfas no 
write down related entirely to the wedco facilities which  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to close in fiscal more than two thirds of the write down reduced the carrying value of goodwill created by the april acquisition of wedco 
the remaining charge related to machinery and equipment within the facilities to be closed 
see business petrochemical processing size reduction services and note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
non recurring compensation charges of  in fiscal related to previous acquisitions made by the company 
most of the expense consists of severance and consulting fee obligations resulting from the wedco acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined these expenses would not benefit the company in the future 
inventory writedowns of  in fiscal consisted of a reduction in the carrying value of inventory  within the oilfield service operations  which partially related to the acquisition of baker hughes tubular services  inc bhts in september in fiscal  the company incurred  in non recurring litigation charges 
during the fourth quarter and subsequent to year end  the company determined that it was probable that certain legal matters of the company would result in a charge to income and that these charges could be reasonably estimated 
eight five percent of the charge relates to the settlement of the litigation of a dispute concerning the assumption of certain liabilities in connection with the acquisition of bhts in september of the remaining charges   related to a personal injury claim made against the company 
see business legal proceedings 
operating income 
operating income decreased from operating income of  for the year ended september  to an operating loss of  for the year ended september  the decrease is due to the changes in revenues  selling  general and administrative  depreciation and amortization and unusual items during fiscal versus fiscal as explained above 
net interest income decreased from  in fiscal to during fiscal this change resulted from the debt assumed in connection with the wedco acquisition  a lower average cash balance and lower yields on the company s high quality commercial paper portfolio 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the company decreased its valuation allowance through the fiscal provision to reflect its ability to benefit from temporary differences 
in connection with the purchase price accounting for the wedco acquisition  the company reversed the remaining valuation allowance against net tax assets expected to be realized  resulting in a decrease in acquired goodwill 
net income 
for the year ended september   the company had a net loss of  as compared to net income of  for the year ended september  due to the factors described above
