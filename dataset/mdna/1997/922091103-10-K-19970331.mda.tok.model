item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in october to develop software to enable businesses to improve their customer service 
the company was engaged principally in research and development from inception through december  the company introduced its first product  vantive support  in july  and introduced vantive quality and the oracle version of vantive support in the fall of the company introduced vantive helpdesk in august  vantive sales in early  and vantive fieldservice in early license fees for the company s software products consist of i a per server fee based on the specific vantive enterprise application s licensed and ii a fee based on the maximum number of concurrent or named users allowed to access those applications 
most of the company s revenues to date have resulted from non recurring license fees based on sales of concurrent user licenses 
the remaining revenues are primarily attributable to service revenues  which include post contract support  consulting and training revenue 
of these service revenues  only post contract support revenues are expected to be recurring 
post contract support revenues accounted for approximately of total revenues in because concurrent user fees are not application specific  the breakdown of revenues attributable to specific applications for customers that have purchased more than one application cannot be precisely determined by the company 
however  the company believes that most of its revenues have been derived from fees associated with vantive support and  to a lesser degree  vantive helpdesk 
in any period  a significant portion of the company s revenues may be derived from large sales to a limited number of customers 
however  no customer accounted for or more of total revenues in or as significant sales to a particular customer are typically non recurring  the company does not believe its future results are dependent on recurring revenues from any particular customer 
the company s revenues are derived from software license fees and fees for its services 
license revenues consist of license fees for the company s products as well as fees from sublicensing third party software products 
the company generally recognizes license fees upon shipment of software products if there are no significant post delivery obligations  if collection is probable and if the license agreement requires payment within one year 
if significant post delivery obligations exist or if a product is subject to customer acceptance  revenues are deferred until no significant obligations remain or acceptance has occurred 
revenues from services have to date consisted primarily of consulting revenues  post contract support revenues and  to a lesser extent  training revenues 
consulting and training revenues generally are recognized as services are performed 
post contract support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the support period  which is typically one year 
if post contract support services are included free or at a discount in a license agreement  such amounts are allocated out of the license fee at their fair market value based on the value established by independent sale of such post contract support services to customers 
if a transaction includes both license and service elements  license fee revenue is recognized upon shipment of the software  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the base product and the payment terms for licenses are not subject to acceptance criteria 
in cases where license fee payments are contingent upon the acceptance of services  revenues from both the license and the service elements are deferred until the acceptance criteria are met 
see note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
international revenues  or revenues derived from sales to customers in foreign countries  accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenue in  and  respectively 
the company believes that its continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of its international operations 
to successfully expand international sales  the company must establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers 
to the extent that the company is unable to do so in a timely manner  the company s growth in international sales  if any  will be limited  and the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
as the company continues to expand its international operations  significant costs may be incurred ahead of any anticipated international revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  future increases in the value of the us dollar could make the company s products less competitive in foreign markets 
as the company increases its foreign sales  it may be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  increases in duty rates  exchange or price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies 
additional risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs of localizing products for foreign countries  lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes a number of forward looking statements which reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated

the decrease in cost of service revenues as a percentage of the related service revenues from to was primarily due to economies of scale realized as a result of a higher level of service activity and due post contract support revenues constituting a higher proportion of total service revenues 
the cost of services as a percentage of service revenues may vary between periods due to mix of services provided by the company and the resources used to provide these services 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million  or of revenues  in to million  or of revenues  in and to million  or of revenues  in these increases in absolute dollars were primarily related to the expansion of the company s sales and marketing resources  increased commissions expenses as a result of higher sales levels and increased marketing activities  including direct mail  trade shows and other promotional expenses

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million  or of revenues  in to million  or of revenues  in and to million  or of revenues in general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars during these periods primarily due to the addition of staff and information system investments to support the growth of the company s business during these periods 
the company expects general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars 
provision for income taxes 
the company s provision for state and federal income taxes in was immaterial due to cumulative operating losses 
the provision for income taxes for was  and  in  based upon an estimated effective tax rate of approximately and  respectively  resulting primarily from state and federal alternate minimum and foreign taxes 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company expects its effective tax rate to increase in financial condition total assets as of december  increased million from december  the increase was primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets  and property and equipment 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million  primarily due to increased net income 
net accounts receivable increased million primarily due to increased sales activity 
net property and equipment increased million primarily due to equipment purchases associated with supporting the growth of the company s business during this period 
current liabilities as of december  increased million from december  the increase was due to increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to increased expense levels and accruals associated with a higher transaction volume and deferrals of revenues related to post contract support 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided million in the primary source of these funds was net income and increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenues  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets

investing activities used cash of million in  primarily for the purchase of capital equipment 
investing activities used cash of million in  primarily for the purchase of short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities and  to a lesser extent  for the purchase of capital equipment 
the company does not currently have any material commitments for capital equipment acquisitions 
financing activities provided cash of million in the primary source of these funds was proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of outstanding stock options  partially offset by payments on capital lease obligations 
financing activities provided million in  principally due to proceeds from the company s initial public offering completed in august at december   the company s principal sources of liquidity were its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
the company believes that existing cash and short term investments balances and potential cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months 
while operating activities may provide cash in certain periods to the extent the company experiences growth in the future  operating and investing activities may use cash  and consequently  such growth may require the company to obtain additional sources of financing 
business risks this report includes a number of forward looking statements which reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated 
in this report  the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  future and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
future operating results uncertain 
the company has experienced significant growth in revenues in recent periods 
the company does not believe that the historical growth rates of revenues  or the corresponding general declines of operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  will be sustainable or are indicative of future results 
in addition  the company s limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
the company s future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for the company s products  the level of product and price competition  the ability of the company to develop and market new products and to control costs  the ability of the company to expand its direct sales force and indirect distribution channels and the ability to attract and retain key personnel 
the company is currently investing  and intends to continue to invest  significant resources to develop its sales strategy  which could adversely affect the company s operating margins 
in this regard  the company has recently hired and continues to hire significant numbers of direct sales personnel and has developed relationships with several high end integrators and resellers  including eds  deloitte touche  price waterhouse  kpmg peat marwick  and hbo and company 
competition for sales personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its existing sales personnel or that it can attract  assimilate and retain additional highly qualified sales personnel in the future 
the strategy also depends  in large part  on attracting and retaining appropriate third party relationships 
there also can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain appropriate high end integrators  resellers and other third party distributors to market the company s products effectively 
further  the company believes  based on interactions with its customers and potential customers  that the purchase of its products is relatively discretionary and generally involves a significant commitment of capital 
as a result  in the event of any downturn in any potential customer s business or the economy in general  purchases of the company s products may be deferred or canceled  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company was not profitable prior to  and there can be no assurance that the company will remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results have in the past varied and may in the future vary significantly depending on factors such as the size  timing and recognition of revenue from significant orders  increased competition  the timing of new product releases by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of the company s products  changes in the company s and its competitors pricing policies  the mix of license and service revenue  budgeting cycles of its customers  seasonality  the mix of direct and indirect sales  changes in operating expenses  changes in company strategy  personnel changes  foreign currency exchange rates and general economic factors 
the company is currently investing  and intends to continue to invest  significant resources to develop its sales strategy  which could adversely affect the company s operating margins 
in this regard  the company has recently hired and continues to hire significant numbers of direct sales personnel and has developed relationships with several high end integrators and resellers  including eds  deloitte touche  price waterhouse  kpmg peat marwick and hbo and company 
competition for sales personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its existing sales personnel or that it can attract  assimilate and retain additional highly qualified sales personnel in the future 
the strategy also depends  in large part  on attracting and retaining appropriate third party relationships 
there also can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain appropriate high end integrators  resellers and other third party distributors to market the company s products effectively 
further  the company believes  based on interactions with its customers and potential customers  that the purchase of its products is relatively discretionary and generally involves a significant commitment of capital 
as a result  in the event of any downturn in any potential customer s business or the economy in general  purchases of the company s products may be deferred or canceled 
a significant portion of the company s revenues in any quarter are typically derived from non recurring sales to a limited number of customers 
accordingly  revenues in any one quarter are not indicative of revenues in any future period 
in addition  like many software applications businesses  the company has generally recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of each quarter  with these revenues concentrated in the last weeks of the quarter 
any significant deferral of purchases of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition in any particular quarter  and to the extent that significant sales occur earlier than expected  operating results for subsequent quarters may be adversely affected 
product revenues are also difficult to forecast because the market for customer asset management software products is rapidly evolving 
the company s sales cycle is typically six to nine months and varies substantially from customer to customer 
the company expects that sales derived through indirect channels  which are harder to predict and may have lower margins than direct sales  will increase as a percentage of total revenues 
the company operates with little order backlog because its products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result of these factors  quarterly revenues for any future quarter are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenues 
in particular  the company is currently investing  and intends to continue to invest  significant resources to develop its sales strategy  which includes hiring significant numbers of direct sales personnel  and developing relationships with high end integrators and resellers 
if revenues are below expectations  operating results are likely to be adversely affected 
net income may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenues  because a significant portion of the company s expenses do not vary with revenues 
the company may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities 
in particular  if new competitors  technological advances by existing competitors  or other competitive factors require the company to invest significantly greater resources in research and development efforts  the company s operating margins in the future may be adversely affected 
the foregoing statements regarding the company s future revenues and net income are forward looking statements  and actual results may vary substantially depending upon a variety of factors described in this paragraph and elsewhere in this report 
because of these factors  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
rapid technological change and product development risks 
the customer asset management market is subject to rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete 
as a result  the company s position in its existing markets or other markets that it may enter could be eroded rapidly by product advances 
the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate 
the company s growth and future financial performance will depend in part upon its ability to enhance existing applications  develop and introduce new applications that keep pace with technological advances  meet changing customer requirements  respond to competitive products and achieve market acceptance 
for example  the company s customers have adopted a wide variety of hardware  software  database  internet based and networking platforms  and as a result  to gain broad market acceptance  the company must continue to support and maintain its products on a variety of such platforms 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers by supporting existing and emerging hardware  software  database  internet based and networking platforms and by developing and introducing enhancements to its products and new products on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
the success of the company s products may also depend  in part  on the ability of the company to effectively distribute its products through the internet 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully change other aspects of its business  such as its distribution channels or cost structure  if technological changes in its market require such change 
the company s product development efforts are expected to require  from time to time  substantial investments by the company in product development and testing 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments 
the company has in the past experienced development delays  and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such delays in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new or enhanced products  including but not limited to  vantive version  vantive version and vanweb in addition  there can be no assurance that such products will meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance or that the company s current or future products will conform to industry requirements 
if the company is unable  for technological reasons  to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain errors that may be detected at any point in the products life cycles 
the company has in the past discovered software errors in certain of its products and has experienced delays in shipment of products during the period required to correct these errors 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found  resulting in loss of  or delay in  market acceptance and sales  diversion of development resources  injury to the company s reputation  or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

international operations  foreign currency fluctuations 
international revenue  or revenue derived from sales to customers in foreign countries  accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenue in  and  respectively 
the company believes that its continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of its international operations 
to successfully expand international sales  the company must establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers 
to the extent that the company is unable to do so in a timely manner  the company s growth in international sales  if any  will be limited  and the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
as the company continues to expand its international operations  significant costs may be incurred ahead of any anticipated international revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  future increases in the value of the us dollar could make the company s products less competitive in foreign markets 
as the company increases its foreign sales  it may be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  increases in duty rates  exchange or price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies 
additional risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs of localizing products for foreign countries  lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition 
the customer asset management software market is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and subject to rapid change 
because the company offers multiple software applications which can be purchased separately or integrated as part of vantive enterprise  the company competes with a variety of other businesses depending on the target market for their applications software products 
these competitors include a select number of businesses targeting the enterprise level and department level customer asset management markets  such as aurum software  inc  clarify  inc  onyx software  scopus technology and siebel systems  inc some of which have only recently entered these markets 
the company also competes with a substantial number of small private businesses and certain public businesses which offer products targeted at one or more specific markets  including the customer support market  the help desk market  the quality assurance market and the sales and marketing automation market  such as remedy corporation and software artistry  inc in addition  the company believes that existing competitors and new market entrants will attempt to develop fully integrated customer asset management information systems 
the company also competes with third party professional service organizations that develop custom software and with internal information technology departments of customers which develop customer interaction applications 
among the company s current and potential competitors are also a number of large hardware and software businesses that may develop or acquire products that compete with the company s products 
in this regard  sap ag  the baan company and oracle have each introduced a customer support module as part of their application suites 
in addition  oracle has recently announced the creation of a network of third party dealers that will sell oracle s application suites exclusively to medium sized businesses 
the company expects large software vendors in the erp market may enter the customer asset management market 
these competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company 
the company also expects that competition will increase as a result of software industry consolidations 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of the company s prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
the company also expects that competition may increase as a result of both new software start ups entering the market as well as existing software industry vendors which may be planning to enter the market for customer asset management applications 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced operating margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than can the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not materially adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting its market include product features such as adaptability  scaleability  ability to integrate with products produced by other vendors  functionality  ease of use  product reputation  quality  performance  price  customer service and support  the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts and company reputation 
although the company believes that its products currently compete favorably with respect to such factors  there can be no assurance that the company can maintain its competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial  marketing  service  support  technical and other resources 
management of expanding operations  dependence upon key personnel 
the company s ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will require the company to continue to improve its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and expand  train and manage its employee workforce 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so successfully 
the company s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has recently hired a significant number of employees  including senior sales  marketing  research and development  and finance personnel  and in order to maintain its ability to grow in the future  the company will be required to significantly increase its total headcount 
in addition  the company s future performance depends in significant part upon attracting and retaining key technical  sales  senior management and financial personnel 
in particular  delays in hiring sales or research and development personnel may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers or the inability to recruit other additional senior management could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition for such personnel is intense  and the inability to retain its key technical  sales  senior management and financial personnel or to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical  sales  senior management and financial personnel in the future on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
increased use of third party software 
the company currently markets a proprietary application development environment for its customers to tailor its applications 
this application development environment is also used by the company to build and modify its applications products 
while the company believes  based on interactions with its customers and potential customers  that it currently derives significant competitive advantage from this proprietary application development environment  it believes that competitive pressures  technological changes demanded by customers  and significant advances in the sophistication of third party application development tools such as visual basic for applications will require the company to make greater use of third party software in the future 
in particular  the company has recently announced that vantive encyclopedia  a web based marketing encyclopedia based on firstfloor s java based server  and configuration capabilities  based on calico technology s configuration engine  will be available with vantive version the company has also announced that it has entered into a development partnership with peoplesoft with the goal of developing joint applications 
vantive is currently integrating manufacturing and distribution applications available from peoplesoft with the vantive fieldservice application 
the greater use of third party software could require the company to invest significant resources in rewriting some or all of its software applications products utilizing third party software and or to enter into license arrangements with third parties which could result in higher royalty payments and a loss of product differentiation 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to successfully rewrite its applications or enter into commercially reasonable licenses  and the costs of  or inability or delays in  doing so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
a recently defeated ballot initiative in california would have subjected corporations and their directors and officers to increased risk of suit and may prohibit corporations from indemnifying officers and directors and expose directors and officers of corporations to increased risk of personal liability 
such a law could increase litigation expenses and the cost of related insurance and adversely affect the financial position and results of operations of the company 
in addition  the increased risk of personal liability could interfere with the ability of the company to attract and retain directors and officers  which in turn could adversely affect the company s competitive position 
dependence on emerging markets for customer asset management software  product concentration 
the company s future financial performance will depend in large part on the growth in demand for individual customer asset management applications as well as the number of organizations adopting comprehensive customer asset management software information systems for their client server and web computing environments 
to date  much of the company s license revenues have resulted from sales of individual applications  particularly vantive support and vantive helpdesk 
the markets for these applications are relatively new and undeveloped  and failure of these markets to develop would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  the company is investing in the sales  field service and quality automation markets 
should these markets fail to develop  not accept the company s products  or cause the company to lose new business and or customers in its traditional markets  the company would experience an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company believes that an important competitive advantage for its software applications is their ability to be integrated with one another and with other back office applications software into a customer asset management information system 
if the demand for integrated suites of customer asset management applications fails to develop  or develops more slowly than the company currently anticipates  it could have a material adverse effect on the demand for the company s applications and on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  any other factor adversely affecting the demand for the company s existing applications  particularly vantive support  vantive helpdesk and vantive quality  or newer applications such as vantive on the go  vantive sales or vantive fieldservice could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
need to expand distribution channels and successfully leverage third party relationships 
an important element of the company s distribution strategy is to expand its direct sales force  to create additional relationships with third parties and to dedicate certain direct sales resources and leverage third party relationships toward key vertical markets 
an important element of the company s product development strategy is to integrate with applications from erp vendors 
the company is currently investing  and intends to continue to invest  significant resources toward these strategies  which could adversely affect the company s operating margins 
in this regard  the company has recently hired and continues to hire significant numbers of direct sales personnel 
competition for sales personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its existing sales personnel or that it can attract  assimilate and retain additional highly qualified sales personnel in the future 
the strategy also depends  in large part  on attracting and retaining beneficial third party relationships 
in this regard  the company has developed relationships with several high end integrators and resellers  including eds  deloitte touche  price waterhouse  kpmg peat marwick and hbo and company  and announced a partnership with peoplesoft  an erp vendor 
there also can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain appropriate high end integrators  resellers  other third party distributors or erp vendors 
the company s agreements with these third parties are not exclusive and  in many cases  may be terminated by either party without cause 
in addition  many of these third parties sell or co market competing product lines 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any of these parties will continue to represent or recommend the company s products 
there also can be no assurance that the company will effectively identify key vertical markets 
the inability to recruit  or the loss of  important direct sales personnel  high end integrators  resellers  other third party distributors or erp vendors  or the failure to effectively identify key vertical markets  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
possible volatility of stock price 
future announcements concerning the company or its competitors  quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by the company or its competitors  proprietary rights or other litigation  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or other factors could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially  particularly on a quarterly basis 
in addition  stock prices for many technology companies fluctuate widely for reasons which may be unrelated to operating results of such companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  market and political conditions such as recessions or military conflicts  may materially and adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on licensed technology 
vantive licenses technology on a non exclusive basis from several businesses for use with its products and anticipates that it will continue to do so in the future 
the inability of the company to continue to license these products or to license other necessary products for use with its products or substantial increases in royalty payments under third party licenses could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the effective implementation of the company s products depends upon the successful operation of these licensed products in conjunction with the company s products  and therefore any undetected errors in such licensed products may prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of the company s products  delay new product introductions and or injure the company s reputation 
such problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on proprietary technology  risks of infringement 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secrets laws  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that such measures will be adequate to protect the company from infringement of its technology 
the company presently has no patents or patent applications pending 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  attempts may be made to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
in particular  as the company provides its licensees with access to the data model and other proprietary information underlying the company s licensed applications  there can be no assurance that licensees or others will not develop products which infringe the company s proprietary rights 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult  and while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
the company is not aware that any of its products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties  although the company has in the past  and may in the future  receive communications alleging possible infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
the company expects that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the company s target markets grows and the functionality of products in such markets overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

product liability 
the company s license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions intended to limit the company s exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible that the limitation of liability provisions contained in the company s agreements may not be effective 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of products by the company and the incorporation of products from other businesses may entail the risk of such claims 
a successful product liability action brought against the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition
