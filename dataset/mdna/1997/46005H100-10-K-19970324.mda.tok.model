item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains or refers to forward looking information including future revenues  products  and income and is based upon current expectations that involve a number of business risks and uncertainties 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statement include  but are not limited to  technological innovations of competitors  changes in health care regulations and reimbursements  litigation claims  changes in foreign economic conditions or currency translation  product acceptance  government approvals or changes in government regulation of the company s products  as well as other factors discussed in other securities and exchange commission filings for the company 
financial condition during the year ended december   imtc and the murex group collectively referred to herein for consolidated financial purposes only as the company  returned to profitability  maintained positive working capital and secured a million line of credit to meet its capital needs 
litigation and technology disputes the murex group s business utilizes newly developed technologies that include patents on processes and devices 
these types of technologies are the focal point for the biotechnology industry 
the ownership and patentability of such processes or devices have become increasingly complex  resulting in competitive claims of ownership within the industry 
imtc and several subsidiaries of the murex group were involved in several lawsuits  including technology patent issues  which were settled during the company is not presently the defendant in any material judicial proceeding 
the company has remaining obligations related to these matters  which have been accrued in the consolidated financial statements 
the company is vigorously pursuing its patent infringement suit in which the company is the plaintiff against abbott  and continues to defend one uk inland revenue claim  both of which are discussed below 
on july   mdc filed a patent infringement suit against abbott laboratories seeking injunctive relief against abbott and damages for infringement of a patent held by mdc for a particle bound binding component immunoassay 
the suit alleges that two abbott systems  the abbott imx immunoassay and the abbott axsym system  infringe one or more claims of the patent 
during  the uk inland revenue questioned the tax basis of inventory  accounts receivable and property  plant and equipment related to the purchase of assets from wellcome 
if the inland revenue is successful in its argument  a tax charge of up to million could arise 
management believes it has meritorious defenses against the claims of the inland revenue and  therefore  has not recorded a provision for losses related to this matter 
during october  her majesty s customs and excise tax required mdl to pay approximately  in value added tax vat related to its central cost allocation agreements with its subsidiaries 
management believed this assessment was incorrect and lodged an appeal 
in july  the uk tribunal ruled in the company s favor and this assessment was withdrawn 
in addition to receiving a refund of the  assessment  the company received compound interest and expenses related to defending its position 
liquidity and capital resources the company has sufficient cash resources and adequate working capital to carry on its current business and meet existing capital requirements 
cash and working capital totaled million and million  respectively at december  the company used million cash from operating activities  mainly to fulfill its obligations under the chiron and class action settlements obtained during on november   the company entered into a three year  million asset based line of credit facility with bank of america  which is collateralized by the accounts receivable and inventory of its us  us and barbados subsidiaries 
as of december   there was million of availability remaining under this facility  net of a letter of credit outstanding of the credit facility was drawn upon for  among other things  payments associated with the innogenetics alliance  working capital and ongoing business activities 
on december   management entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the lender that fixed the interest rate at for a notional principal amount of million 
the company s working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors the results of research and development  the levels of resources devoted to the establishment and expansion of marketing and manufacturing  technological developments  and the timing and costs of obtaining approvals for new products 
depending on the outcome of these factors  the company may need to raise additional funds in the future for use to fund acquisitions  complete products in development  and for general purposes 
there are no assurances that such funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
mdc completed a non exclusive  out licensing transaction during the second quarter of by licensing technology acquired as part of the acquisition of the diagnostics division of wellcome to abbott 
this transaction provided mdc with a million minimum license fee to be paid over four years 
mdc received  million  million and million in  and  respectively 
mdc received the final million of the guaranteed million minimum license fee in january furthermore  mdc earned an additional  and  in and  respectively  as a result of minimum royalty levels being exceeded 
the underlying revenue stream associated with this licensing agreement has been growing at approximately per year 
it continues to remain strong and growing and the company expects the minimum royalty levels to continue to be exceeded until the expiration of the patent in the year therefore  as of  the company anticipates receiving at least million per year from this licensing arrangement 
during february  mdc entered into an exclusive distribution  development and license agreement with innogenetics to develop and market gene probe products for the monitoring of patients and the classification of viral diseases 
under the terms of the agreement  mdc paid million during and will pay million during to innogenetics for the exclusive rights to distribute innogenetics lipa products  excluding hcv  for years 
mdc will also pay innogenetics a royalty of of the murex group s net sales of innogenetics products 
also under this agreement  mdc shall fund agreed upon research and development programs  beginning in and for each of the following years in an amount equal to of the murex group s net sales of innogenetics products  subject to a cap 
the company anticipates that its current capital resources  availability under its line of credit facility  and anticipated profitability will enable it to maintain planned operations for the foreseeable future 
management outlook the key to the company s growth is the ability to identify new needs in the marketplace  and to expeditiously meet these needs through access to appropriate innovations and technologies  and to rapidly incorporate them into the murex group s product line 
however  there can be no assurance that murex group will successfully add a significant number of new products to its product line 
the broadening of the company s focus into the emerging diagnostics monitoring market should support revenue growth in the coming years 
the innogenetics distribution  developing and licensing agreement gives the murex group access to the rapidly growing gene probe market for monitoring patients and the classification of viral diseases 
patient monitoring has become an important and critical element of patient care and treatment 
as a result  demand for superior and unique monitoring tests is rapidly growing 
the company believes it can capture a significant portion of this emerging market by strategically positioning murex in key segments of the market including aids patient treatment  transplant recipients and other immune compromised patients 
as the company s relationship with innogenetics demonstrates  management believes strategic ventures and licensing arrangements position the company for the future and play an important role in the achievement of management s corporate objectives 
the company s worldwide marketing and distribution capabilities motivate companies like innogenetics  digene and eurogenetics to partner with the company in licensing agreements and product development and  thereby  contribute to the flow of new and creative products 
the company s alliances provide the murex group with access to technology  strengthand allow the company to further penetrate its existing markets in blood screening and clinical diagnostics 
throughout and in the years to come  the company will actively seek out acquisitions  strategic business alliances and other opportunities that will support the company s future 
recent murex group product innovations  such as sam tm  and tests for htlv  syphilis and e coli  should contribute to future sales growth 
in addition  new and enhanced products  created through the company s in house research and development endeavors  strengthened the company s broad line of well established virology and bacteriology products and allowed the company to enter new markets in targeted areas around the world 
in addition to relying on research and development and licensing of core technologies  management s operation strategy will also focus on quality  customer service  reducing costs and improving cash flows 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  increased to  over the previous year s revenues of  this increase is mainly due to a  net increase in product sales as a result of the newly acquired innogenetics product line  growth of sales in eastern europe  south america and southeastern asia as well as the acquisition of the company s canadian distributor 
the net increase in product sales represents an actual increase using a constant currency basis of  which was partially offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of  license fees and royalties revenues increased to  from in the previous year  primarily as a result of abbott exceeding the minimum royalty level as defined in the agreement 
gross profit on product sales was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of products grew  as a result of increased sales  increased use of direct distributors  especially for the newly acquired innogenetics products  and increased sales of purchased in products which have lower gross profit margins 
furthermore  the strengthening of the british pound relative to the us dollar throughout caused the translated dollar equivalent cost of manufacturing in the uk to increase 
total operating costs and expenses  excluding cost of products sold  of  for the year ended december  reflect a net decrease of  over the year ended december  research and development costs for were reduced by  due to added efficiencies in internal costs and the company shifting its focus to forming strategic business alliances such as innogenetics 
general and administrative expenses increased  to  for as compared to  for this increase is due to the legal  employee compensation and other expenses associated with settling the company s hcv patent litigation during the third quarter of sales and marketing expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of  was driven by new product introductions  including the innogenetics lipa product line  expansion into the monitoring market and further strengthening of the company s overall distribution network 
the foreign exchange loss for the year ended december  was  versus a gain of  for the loss is primarily attributable to the strengthening of the british pound to its four year high  as mbl the dartford  england manufacturing facility carries intercompany receivables in the local currencies of the various murex group territories 
this foreign exchange loss was further exacerbated by the weakening of the south african rand 
as a result of the settlement with chiron and ortho  a reversal was made to royalty accruals made in prior years  which resulted in a net credit to royalty expense of  for the year ended december  during september  the company recorded a rebefore tax 
the restructuring was driven by a need to reposition the company for its movement into the patient monitoring business 
the world wide plan will result in personnel reductions of approximately people from various functions 
the restructuring charge consists predominantly of costs for employee severance and other benefits  of which  remained accrued at december  management expects the restructuring to be completed by the end of the first quarter of net interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to net interest income of  for the year ended december  due to the increase in long term debt from the new line of credit arrangement and the factoring of italian receivables 
the loss on liquidation of investee of  represents sdl s net loss for the year ended december   net of the estimated gain upon ultimate liquidation 
as of december   imtc and its subsidiaries represented predominantly all creditors of sdl  therefore  in the financial statements  the subsidiary is assumed to be fully liquidated 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  product sales for the year ended december  were  versus  for the comparable prior year 
product sales were  behind s product sales primarily due to the reduction of hcv sales in europe and changes in the worldwide diagnostics market 
the actual sales decrease using a constant currency basis was  largely offset by the positive foreign exchange impact of  revenues for the year ended december  included  of a sell in of hcv tests in anticipation of uk and german injunctions 
the changes in the worldwide diagnostics market have also adversely affected sales including a healthcare workers strike in spain  declines in overall healthcare spending in several western european countries due to changes in reimbursement programs that resulted in fewer diagnostic test kit orders and buying group consolidations in the united states 
the murex group is combating these issues by expanding its business into growth markets which include africa  the middle east and central and south america and by entering strategic alliances which enhance the murex group s product lines and add innovative technology 
license fee revenues of  for represent the present value of the abbott license agreement earned in the second quarter 
gross profit on product sales for the year ended december  was  as compared with for in  cost of products sold increased  particularly in the third and fourth quarters  because of higher costs associated with producing hcv screening tests which caused an erosion of the murex group s gross profit margin 
pricing pressures due to healthcare policies in europe and the necessity of licensing some products with lower margins also contributed to the decline in gross profit 
total operating expenses  excluding cost of products sold  of  for the year ended december  reflect a net increase of  over the year ended december  the weakness of the us dollar in increased total expenses by approximately  over general and administrative expenses  excluding bad debt expense  increased  to  for the year ended december  the murex group s legal and professional fees associated with its hcv litigation increased  over the prior year 
the total increase in general and administrative expense was less than the hcv legal expense increase because general and administrative expenses in also included expenses associated with the abbott licensing in may and employee incentive  retirement and termination payments 
bad debt expense increased  to  for primarily as a result of credit losses on eastern european sales 
sales and marketing of  for the year reflects a  increase over the amounts 
this increase was a result of increased presence by the murex group in the german  eastern european  african  middle eastern and south american markets 
foreign exchange gain for the year ended december  of  reflects a  increase from the foreign exchange loss of  the increase is primarily attributable to the strengthening of values in german mark  french franc  spanish peseta  and italian lira currency based amounts due to mdl 
the decrease in royalties expense from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  is due to lower sales of products with high royalty rates 
the increase in interest income versus the prior year is a result of interest related to the abbott license and higher overall cash in the company during interest expense for the year ended december  of  represented a decrease of  from this net decrease is due to management s decision to voluntarily reduce factoring of italian receivables during
