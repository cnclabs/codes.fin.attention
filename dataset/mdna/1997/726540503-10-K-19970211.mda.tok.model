item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general for the three years ended december   the company reported significant increases in proved reserves  production and cash flow from oil and natural gas producing activities 
such increases are primarily the result of exploitation activities in the la basin properties  the acquisition during of the remaining interest in  and exploitation of  the sunniland trend properties and the fourth quarter acquisition and subsequent exploitation of the illinois basin properties 
these three core areas are comprised primarily of crude oil properties and together account for approximately of the company s year end proved reserves 
see item  business acquisition and exploitation current exploitation projects 
results of operations for the year ended december   the company reported net income before nonrecurring items of million  or 
per share  on total revenue of million 
this compares with net income of million on total revenue of million in and net income of 
million on total revenue of million in earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization ebitda increased in to million from the million reported in and from the million reported in cash flow from operations cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities increased to million in  and above the million and million reported in and  respectively 
cash flow and ebitda are also presented before nonrecurring items 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  million excluding nonrecurring items  as compared to million for and million in the improvement in operating results is primarily attributable to increased production volumes and expanded unit operating margins in the upstream segment and continued growth in the downstream segment 
nonrecurring items in include an million extraordinary charge million net of tax associated with the early redemption of the company s senior subordinated notes due the notes  a million charge related to the settlement of two lawsuits filed during and and an million tax benefit related to the reversal of a portion of the valuation reserve against the company s net deferred tax asset 
after giving effect to such nonrecurring items  the company reported net income for of million  or

the company s unit gross margin increased to per boe in  an improvement of and over the amounts reported for and  respectively 
unit gross profit  which deducts all pre interest cash costs attributable to the upstream segment  was per boe for  up and over the and amounts  respectively 
the significant increase in production volumes is attributable to the company s acquisition and exploitation activities 
as a result of exploitation activities conducted over the last three years  average net daily production from the la basin properties increased to approximately  boe per day  up boe per day  or over and  boe per day  or over the level 
net production from the company s sunniland trend properties averaged approximately  barrels of oil per day in  a increase compared to  barrels per day in and over the  barrels per day in the sunniland trend s production includes the impact of production from two key wells drilled and completed in a development well was drilled in the raccoon point field and was completed and placed on production in late march 
during  daily gross production from this well averaged around  barrels of oil per day 
a short radius horizontal well was placed on production in mid november and averaged approximately  barrels of oil per day during the company owns a working interest and an approximate and net revenue interest in each of these wells  respectively 
at december   these wells accounted for approximately of the company s daily production from the sunniland trend properties 
due to the high volume of production that is generated by very few wells in the sunniland trend  abrupt or abnormal declines or downtime due to mechanical  marketing  or other conditions on any of the properties in this area could have a significant impact on production 
the year to year comparisons of production volumes and unit margins were affected by sales of nonstrategic properties  the acquisition of the company s illinois basin properties in the fourth quarter of and the acquisition of the remaining interest in the sunniland trend properties effective may  net production attributable to properties sold totaled 
million boe  or an average of approximately  boe per day  during and 
million boe  or an average of approximately  boe per day  in oil and natural gas revenues increased to million in as compared to million in and million in due to increased production volumes and higher average product prices 
the company s average product price  which represents a combination of fixed and floating price sales arrangements and incorporates location and quality discounts from the benchmark nymex crude oil price  increased to per boe in as compared to in and approximately as compared to per boe in the increased average product price was primarily attributable to increased crude oil prices  the higher quality illinois basin production  a reduction in the quality and location differentials for the sunniland trend and illinois basin production and the december purchase of a production payment which previously burdened the price on the la basin properties 
financial swap arrangements and futures transactions entered into by the company to hedge production are included in the foregoing prices 
such transactions had the effect of decreasing the overall average price per boe received by the company by and 
in and  respectively  and increasing the average price by

million is related to the company s downstream activities 
approximately of the company s crude oil production was hedged throughout at an average nymex crude oil price of approximately per barrel  and accordingly  the company did not receive the full benefit of the higher nymex crude oil price 
the company routinely hedges a portion of its crude oil production

average unit production expenses declined approximately to per boe versus per boe in and versus per boe in however  unit production expenses for each of the company s three core areas decreased at greater percentages during from the levels  with the la basin declining  the sunniland trend declining and the illinois basin declining 
such relationship is caused by the illinois basin properties  which have higher unit production costs than the company s other two core properties 
the illinois basin properties were acquired effective november   thus significantly skewing the weighted average expenses between the two periods 
unit production expenses for the illinois basin properties  which averaged per boe in the fourth quarter of  averaged approximately per boe during the significant reduction in production expenses for the illinois basin properties was a result of operational modifications implemented throughout the reductions in production expenses in the sunniland trend and la basin were attributable to increased production from fields with a component of fixed production costs that do not increase with incremental production  reimbursements received in for electricity overcharges relating to the la basin properties in the previous year and improved operating practices 
total production expenses increased to million from million and million in and  respectively  primarily due to the acquisition of the illinois basin properties 
unit g a expense in the upstream segment decreased for the fourth consecutive year 
unit g a expense decreased to 
per boe during from 
per boe during unit g a expense was per boe in  per boe in and per boe in these reductions were directly attributable to increased production levels and to the company s ongoing cost reduction and cost control efforts 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a per boe declined to in from in and in primarily as a result of the company s acquisition and exploitation activities 
primarily as a result of increased production levels  total dd a for the year ended december  was million as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the company s downstream segment reported gross margin revenues less direct expenses of purchases  transportation  storage and terminalling of million for the year ended december   reflecting an approximate increase over the million reported for the period and an approximate increase over gross revenues from this segment were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
gross profit gross margin less downstream g a expenses increased  totaling million versus million in  and versus the million in such results are directly attributable to continued growth in base business activities of marketing and terminalling crude oil and strong crude oil demand throughout aggregate marketing and terminalling volumes averaged  barrels per day in versus  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in downstream g a expenses for and were relatively constant at million for each period  while the level for totaled approximately million 
the increase in downstream g a expense in was attributable to the continued expansion of the company s marketing and terminalling activities 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest  for increased to million as compared to million in and million in  primarily due to higher borrowing levels related to the company s acquisition  exploitation  development and exploration activities 
during  and  the company capitalized million  million and million of interest  respectively 
the company and certain of its officers and directors and a former director and officer were named in two class action lawsuits filed in and seeking an aggregate of approximately million in compensatory damages and punitive damages in an unspecified amount for alleged violations of the federal securities laws and state common law arising out of certain alleged misrepresentations and omissions in the company s disclosure regarding its onshore natural gas exploration activities 
during  the company settled such cases for a cash payment of approximately million 
approximately million of such amount was paid by the company s insurance carrier and million was paid by the company 
taking into account prior costs incurred by the company to defend these suits  and for which the company agreed to relinquish its claims for reimbursement against its insurance company  this settlement resulted in a charge to first quarter earnings of million 
effective in  financial accounting standard fas requires companies to record an asset or a liability  as appropriate for its net tax position as a result of differences between financial reporting standards and tax reporting requirements 
the company adopted fas in and at such time recorded a net deferred tax asset of approximately million  but also recorded a valuation reserve against the full amount of such asset to reflect management s uncertainty  based on all information then available  with respect to the realization of such asset 
in the first quarter of  the company reduced its valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of an million credit to deferred income tax expense 
based on recent and anticipated improvement in the company s outlook for sustained profitability  management believes that it is more likely than not that it will generate taxable income sufficient to realize million of unreserved tax benefits associated with certain of the company s net operating loss nol carryforwards prior to their expiration 
the reserve adjustment incorporates management s assessment of the significant  cumulative progress made by the company over the last four years to reduce unit expenses  increase unit gross margins and substantially increase its production and proved reserves through its acquisition and exploitation activities 
from to  unit g a expenses declined  unit gross profit increased and production and proved reserves increased and  respectively 
such reassessment is also reinforced by the refinancing of the notes in march and the increased liquidity and flexibility provided by such refinancing 
the remaining deferred tax asset was not recognized primarily due to limitations imposed by the irs regarding the utilization of nols generated prior to certain of the company s subsidiaries being acquired and the uncertainty of utilizing the company s investment tax credit itc carryforwards 
while the company s tax planning strategies address certain of these restrictions on the application of subsidiary nols  management is currently uncertain as to the extent such strategies will be successful and therefore concluded that a reserve for these amounts was appropriate 
estimates of future taxable income generated using future net cash flows contained in reserve reports prepared by independent consulting firms in accordance with regulations prescribed by the sec also indicate that the unreserved portion of such deferred tax asset will be realized 
such reserve data was utilized in calculating the standardized measure presented in the company s year end financial statements 
see item  properties oil and natural gas reserves 
despite the significant turnaround achieved over the last four years and the current outlook for profitability  due to the uncertainties in the oil and natural gas industry  including but not limited to forecasting production  proved reserves  product prices  production expenses and similar events beyond management s control  there can be no assurance that the company will generate any earnings or specific level of continuing earnings 
the company had carryforwards of approximately million of regular tax nols at december   which expire as follows million  million  million  million  million  million  million   million  million  million and thereafter through million 
approximately million of the regular tax nol carryforwards at december   may only be utilized to the extent certain subsidiaries that generated the nols have taxable income 
see item  business federal taxation 
for the year ended december   the company recognized a net deferred tax benefit before extraordinary item of million 
such amount consists of a million deferred tax provision on the company s income before extraordinary item and the million valuation allowance reduction previously discussed 
in addition  the company reported a million deferred tax benefit as an extraordinary item 
such deferred tax benefit was attributable to the million pre tax first quarter extraordinary loss from the early redemption of the notes 
although the company recorded net income for and  no provision for income taxes was reflected during these years  but rather the valuation allowance discussed above was adjusted 
capital resources  liquidity and financial condition on march   the company sold million of senior subordinated notes due  series a  bearing a coupon rate of the series a notes 
such notes were issued pursuant to a rule a private placement at approximately of the principal amount thereof to yield 
on august   the company exchanged a total of million principal amount of the series a notes for senior subordinated notes due  series b  the series b notes 
the series b notes are substantially identical including principal amount  interest rate  maturity and redemption rights to the series a notes for which they were exchanged  except for certain transfer restrictions relating to the series a notes 
the series a notes and the series b notes collectively  the notes are redeemable  at the option of the company  on or after march  at of the principal amount thereof  at decreasing prices thereafter prior to march   and thereafter at of the principal amount thereof plus  in each case  accrued interest to the date of redemption 
in addition  prior to march   up to million in principal amount of the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  from time to time  at of the principal amount thereof  with the net proceeds of any public equity offering as both are defined in the indenture under which the notes were issued the indenture 
the indenture contains covenants including  but not limited to the following i limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness  ii limitations on certain investments  iii limitations on restricted payments  iv limitations on dispositions of assets  v limitations on dividends and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries  vi limitations on transactions with affiliates  vii limitations on liens  and viii restrictions on mergers  consolidations and transfers of assets 
in the event of a change of control and a corresponding rating decline  as both are defined in the indenture  the company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the repurchase 
the notes are unsecured general obligations of the company and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the company and are guaranteed by all of the company s principal subsidiaries 
proceeds from the sale of the notes  net of offering costs  were approximately million and were used to redeem the notes at of the million principal amount outstanding and  together with amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility  to retire bridge indebtedness associated with the illinois basin acquisition 
prior to redemption  the notes had an average remaining life of three years and scheduled maturities of million in each of and the company has a million revolving credit facility with a group of five banks the lenders 
the revolving credit facility is secured by the oil and natural gas properties of the company and is guaranteed by all of the company s subsidiaries other than pmct  inc pmct  which guarantees are secured by substantially all of the oil and natural gas properties of the company and its subsidiaries and the stock of all guaranteeing subsidiaries 
the cushing terminal is not pledged as security for any of the company s debt 
the borrowing base is currently set at million and is subject to borrowing base availability as determined from time to time by the lenders in good faith  in the exercise of the lenders sole discretion  and in accordance with customary practices and standards in effect from time to time for oil and natural gas loans to borrowers similar to the company 
such borrowing base may be affected from time to time by the performance of the company s oil and natural gas properties and changes in oil and natural gas prices 
the company incurs a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the borrowing base 
the revolving credit facility  as amended  matures on may   at which time the remaining outstanding balance converts to a term loan which is repayable in twenty equal quarterly installments commencing august   with a final maturity of may  the revolving credit facility bears interest  at the company s option of either libor plus or prime rate as defined therein 
at december   outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility were million 
an additional million was reserved against the issuance of a standby letter of credit 
the revolving credit facility contains covenants which  among other things  prohibit the payment of cash dividends  limit the amount of consolidate debt  limit the company s ability to make certain loans and investments  and provide that the company must maintain a specified relationship between current assets and current liabilities 
during  plains marketing increased its uncommitted secured demand transactional line of credit the transactional facility with five banks to million 
the purpose of the transactional facility is to provide standby letters of credit to support the purchase of crude oil for resale and borrowings to finance crude oil inventory which has been hedged against future price risk 
the transactional facility is secured by all of the assets of plains marketing and is guaranteed by the company 
the company s guarantee is secured by a million standby letter of credit issued on behalf of the company 
at december   approximately million in letters of credit were outstanding under the transactional facility 
none of the company s letters of credit under the transactional facility have ever been drawn 
generally  purchases secured by the letters of credit and receivables generated from the sale of crude oil are settled on a monthly basis 
pmct has established a million sublimit the sublimit within the transactional facility for standby letters of credit and borrowings to finance crude oil purchased in connection with operations at the cushing terminal 
under the terms of the sublimit  all purchases of crude oil inventory financed are required to be hedged against future price risk on terms acceptable to the lenders 
standby letters of credit and borrowings under the sublimit are secured by all of the assets of pmct and are recourse only to the subsidiary 
letters of credit under the transactional facility are issued for up to seventy day periods and bear fees of per annum 
borrowings incur interest at the borrower s option of either i the base rate plus or ii libor plus 
all financings under the transactional facility  which expires in november  are at the discretion of the lenders 
aggregate cash borrowings by both subsidiaries are limited to million 
at december   no letters of credit or borrowings were outstanding under the sublimit 
at december   the company had a working capital deficit of approximately million 
the company has historically operated with a working capital deficit due primarily to ongoing capital expenditures that have been financed through cash flow and the revolving credit facility 
the working capital deficits at december  and  were million and million  respectively 
the company has made and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploitation  development  exploration and production of oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  the company has financed these expenditures primarily with cash generated by operations  bank borrowings  and the sale of subordinated notes  common stock and preferred stock 
the company intends to make an aggregate of approximately million in capital expenditures in  including approximately million on the development and exploitation of its la basin  sunniland trend and illinois basin properties  approximately million on exploration and higher risk exploitation activities primarily in the sunniland trend and the la basin and approximately million for various other capital items 
in addition  the company intends to continue to pursue the acquisition of underdeveloped producing properties 
the company believes that it will have sufficient cash from operating activities and borrowings under the revolving credit facility to fund such planned capital expenditures 
changing oil and natural gas prices the company is affected by changes in crude oil prices which have historically been volatile 
although the company has routinely hedged a substantial portion of its crude oil production and intends to continue this practice  substantial future crude oil price declines would have a negative impact on the company s overall results  and therefore its liquidity 
furthermore  low crude oil prices could affect the company s ability to raise capital on terms favorable to the company 
in order to manage its exposure to commodity price risk  the company has routinely hedged a portion of its crude oil production 
for  the company has entered into various fixed price and floating price collar arrangements 
such arrangements generally provide the company with downside price protection on approximately  barrels of oil per day at a nymex crude oil price of approximately per barrel but permit the company to receive the benefit of increases in the nymex crude oil price up to per barrel on  of such barrels per day 
thus  based on the company s average fourth quarter oil production rate  these arrangements generally provide the company with downside price protection for of its production and upside price participation for of its production up to per barrel  while of such production and excess volumes  if any  remain unhedged 
in addition  the company also has a fixed price arrangement on  barrels per day for at a nymex crude oil price of per barrel 
management intends to continue to maintain hedging arrangements for a significant portion of its production 
such contracts may expose the company to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances

financing activities during include net payments from short term borrowings of million related to the transactional facility 
such amounts were borrowed to finance the purchase of crude oil inventory in which was sold in financing activities include proceeds from the sale of capital stock of million  
million and million in  and  respectively 
such proceeds in and were primarily from the exercise of employee stock options while the proceeds were primarily from the issuance of the preferred stock which was converted into common stock in commitments although the company obtained environmental studies on its properties in the la basin  sunniland trend and illinois basin and the company believes that such properties have been operated in accordance with standard oil field practices  certain of the fields have been in operation for approximately years  and current or future local  state and federal environmental laws and regulations may require substantial expenditures to comply with such rules and regulations 
consistent with normal industry practices  substantially all of the company s oil and natural gas leases require that  upon termination of economic production  the working interest owners plug and abandon non producing wellbores  remove tanks  production equipment and flow lines and restore the wellsite 
the company has estimated that the costs to perform these tasks is approximately million  net of salvage value and other considerations 
such estimated costs are amortized to expense through the unit of production method as a component of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization 
results from operations for  and include 
million  million and million  respectively  of expense associated with these estimated future costs 
for valuation and realization purposes of the affected oil and natural gas properties  these estimated future costs are also deducted from estimated future gross revenues to arrive at the estimated future net revenues and the standardized measure disclosed in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
