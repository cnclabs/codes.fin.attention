polymicro  now a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  continues to operate its facility in phoenix  arizona 
spnc has been engaged in the research and development of products to treat cardiovascular disease since in  spnc commenced sales of its cvx registered trademark laser unit and fiber optic catheters to approved clinical investigational sites in the united states and to european medical centers 
on february   spnc received approval of its pma and shortly thereafter began selling its cvx registered trademark laser unit and certain fiber optic catheters in the us market 
historically  spnc s revenues and results of operations have fluctuated depending on several factors  including fda regulation of the number of approved clinical sites and the number of patients treated  the revenue mix between laser units and catheters  the costs incurred in expanding manufacturing capacity  spnc s ability to improve production yields resulting from modifications in the manufacturing process  the expenses incurred in developing sales  expenses of marketing and customer service  and the expenses related to product development and clinical trials 
spnc expects that future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate depending on the factors listed above as well as the market acceptance of spnc s products  the timing of new product introductions  the level of research and development activity  the increase in sales and marketing expenses  the implementation of health care reform  and competition 
in addition  the price of each cvx registered trademark  laser unit is significant and  therefore  a relatively small change in unit volume may cause a significant fluctuation in revenues 
spnc believes that uncertainties in the structure of health care delivery and payment systems have had  and may continue to have  an adverse effect on revenues 
while spnc believes that the laser angioplasty procedure offers a less costly alternative for the treatment of certain types of heart disease  there can be no assurance that hospitals will be willing to make the expenditures for new capital equipment 
furthermore  alternatives to laser angioplasty exist and the industry is subject to technological change  including the introduction of new competing therapies 
therefore  the future demand for laser angioplasty products is uncertain 
if spnc is unable to increase revenues from the sale of lasers and catheters  it is likely that it will be unable to achieve break even operations from its interventional cardiology business
