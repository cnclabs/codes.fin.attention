the company used such net proceeds  along with an aggregate of million received by the company concurrent with the ipo from an officer of the company and a selling stockholder in repayment of indebtedness owing by such officer and selling stockholder to the company  to reduce its outstanding indebtedness under the line of credit 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company s net cash used in operations primarily related to increases in working capital requirements to support growth in the company s business during these periods 
these increased working capital requirements were partially funded by cash generated by the company s operations

the company anticipates that its total investment in upgrades and additions to facilities for fiscal will be approximately million to million 
working capital increased to million at march  from million at march   an increase of million which was primarily attributable to increases in inventory and accounts receivable which were partially offset by increases in accounts payable 
during fiscal years and  the company generally maintained an accounts receivable balance of approximately and days of sales  respectively 
this increase is primarily related to an increased concentration of receivables from large retail computer and office product superstores  who generally take longer to pay 
during fiscal years and  the company maintained an inventory turnover rate of approximately turns  excluding inventory owned by the company related to pfs  its subsidiary which provides product fulfillment and distribution services to third parties 
the levels of such inventory is generally managed by the third party and thus is not indicative of the inventory turnover maintained by the company s core wholesale business

the line of credit was to mature in april in fiscal year  the company applied the net proceeds of the ipo  together with certain other amounts received concurrently therewith  to reduce outstanding debt under the line of credit 
as a result of this reduction in the indebtedness and the company s reduced borrowing needs  in may  the company entered into a new agreement with certain banks for a new three year unsecured revolving line of credit facility the new facility 
under the new facility  the company could borrow initially up to million until april  and up to million thereafter until maturity 
this facility was amended during fiscal year to increase the borrowing limit to million 
availability under the new facility is based upon amounts of eligible accounts receivable  as defined 
as of march   the company had borrowed million under the new facility 
also  as of march   million was available for additional borrowings 
the new facility matures in may and accrues interest  at the company s option  at the prime rate of a bank or a eurodollar rate plus an adjustment ranging from to depending on the company s financial performance 
a commitment fee of to is charged on the unused portion of the new facility 
the new facility contains various covenants including  among other things  the maintenance of certain financial ratios including the achievement of a minimum fixed charge ratio and minimum level of tangible net worth  and restrictions on certain activities of the company  including loans and payments to related parties  incurring additional debt  acquisitions  investments and asset sales 
during fiscal year  approximately million  or  of the company s net sales were sold through the company s canadian  mexican  australian and us export operations  including latin america 
the company believes that international markets represent further opportunities for growth 
the company attempts to protect itself from foreign currency fluctuations by denominating substantially all of its non canadian and non australian international sales in us dollars 
in addition  on an annual basis  the company has entered into various one year forward canadian currency exchange contracts in order to hedge the company s net investment in  and its intercompany payable applicable to  its canadian subsidiary 
there have been no material gains or losses incurred by the company relating to these contracts 
in may  the company entered into a new million us one year forward canadian currency exchange contract to replace the previous contract which matured during that same month

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective october   the company acquired  with cash and common stock  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of lasercharge pty ltd lasercharge 
lasercharge is an australian wholesale distributor of computer and office automation supplies and accessories 
the acquisition of lasercharge was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and  accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets and liabilities assumed based on the fair values at the date of acquisition 
the company believes that the integration of lasercharge into the company s business operations will not require significant working capital nor create other significant financing needs 
the company believes it will be able to satisfy its working capital needs for fiscal year  including such additional working capital as may be required by existing or additional pfs logistics contracts  as well as business growth and planned capital expenditures  through funds available under the new facility  trade credit  lease financing  internally generated funds and by increasing the amount available under the new facility although the company has presently neither requested nor received any commitment to do so 
in addition  although the company has no plans to do so  and depending on market conditions and the terms thereof  the company may also consider obtaining additional funds through an additional line of credit  other debt financing or the sale of capital stock  however  no assurance can be given in such regard 
the company may attempt to acquire other businesses to expand its product line and or in the call center or public warehousing industries in connection with its efforts to grow its pfs subsidiary 
the company currently has no agreements to acquire any such businesses 
should the company be successful in identifying an acquisition candidate  however  the company may require additional financing to consummate such a transaction 
acquisitions involve certain risks and uncertainties  therefore  the company can give no assurances with respect to whether it will be successful in identifying such a business to acquire  whether it will be able to obtain financing to complete such an acquisition  or whether the company will be successful in operating the acquired business 
inventory management the company manages its computer consumables supplies inventories held for sale in its wholesale distribution business by maintaining sufficient quantities of product to achieve high order fill rates while at the same time maximizing inventory turnover rates 
inventory balances will fluctuate as the company adds new product lines and makes large purchases from suppliers to take advantage of attractive terms 
to reduce the risk of loss to the company due to supplier price reductions and slow moving inventory  the company s purchasing agreements with many of its suppliers  including most of its major suppliers  contain price protection and stock return privileges under which the company receives credits against future purchases if the supplier lowers prices on previously purchased inventory or the company can return slow moving inventory in exchange for other products 
during fiscal year  the company  through its pfs subsidiary  began providing product fulfillment and distribution services for third parties 
certain of these distribution agreements provide that the company own the related inventory  some of which also allow for the third party to manage the levels of inventory held by the company 
as a result  the levels of inventory held by the company under these contracts is higher than the company would normally carry in its core wholesale business 
seasonality although the company historically has experienced its greatest growth in revenues in its fourth fiscal quarter  management has not been able to determine the specific effect  if any  of seasonal factors that may cause quarterly variability in operating results 
management believes  however  that factors that may influence quarterly variability include the overall growth in the non paper computer supplies industry and shifts in demand for the company s products due to a variety of factors  including sales increases resulting from the introduction of new computer supplies products 
the company generally experiences a relative slowness in sales during the summer months  which may adversely affect the company s first and second fiscal quarter results in relation to sequential quarter performance 
the company believes that the results of operations for a quarterly period may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the full year 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations
