effects of third party payor contracts traditionally  art services have been supported by a large self pay population and conventional infertility services have been largely covered by indemnity insurance 
currently  there are several states which mandate offering benefits of varying degrees for infertility 
in some cases  the mandate is limited to an obligation on the part of the payor to offer the benefit to employers 
in massachusetts  rhode island  maryland  arkansas  illinois and hawaii the mandate requires coverage of conventional infertility services as well as art treatments 
outside of mandated states  managed care payors have traditionally covered conventional infertility but not art services 
there is a growing trend of payors beginning to develop comprehensive coordinated benefits through full service infertility and art medical providers 
over the past few years much attention has been focused on clinical outcomes in managed care 
infertility is a disorder which naturally lends itself to developing a managed care plan 
first  infertility has a clearly defined endpoint an infertile couple either conceives or does not conceive 
second  the treatment regimens and protocols used for treating infertile couples have predictable outcomes that make it possible to develop statistical tables for the probability of success 
third  it is possible to develop rational treatment plans over a limited period of time for infertile couples 
the company  through its rsc division  has invested in information technology that takes into consideration the cost structure of a full service practice  the probability of achieving clinical success  and defined treatment plans which result in improved outcomes and reduced costs 
the company estimates that the majority of the couples participating in infertility and art services at a network site  other than in massachusetts  have greater than of their costs reimbursed by their health care insurance carrier 
in massachusetts  where comprehensive infertility and art services insurance reimbursement is mandated  virtually all patient costs are reimbursed 
to the extent insurance reimbursement for art services becomes more widespread  the company anticipates that the demand for such services will increase 
however  the enactment of health care reform legislation may adversely affect reimbursement for art and infertility services and thereby the demand for such services may decrease 
see government regulation 
the majority of diagnostic and therapeutic services offered through the company s awm division are covered by third party payors 
as these services emphasize prevention and screening  they are expected to continue to be covered by third party payors 
reliance on third party vendors the network sites under the rsc division are dependent on three third party vendors that produce patient fertility medications lupron  metrodin and fertinex which are vital to the provision of art services 
should any of these vendors experience a supply shortage of medication  it may have an adverse impact on the operations of the network sites 
to date  the network sites under the rsc division have not experienced any such adverse impacts
