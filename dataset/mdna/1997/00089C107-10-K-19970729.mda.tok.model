the episcan system will range in price from  to technology the company s metrology and inspection products use its proprietary non contact capacitive  magnetic and optical technologies to measure the dimensional  magnetic and surface characteristics of semiconductor wafers and devices and hard disks 
dimensional technology the company s non contact capacitive gaging technology  which is the subject of a series of patents  is used to measure the dimensional parameters thickness  flatness  shape of semiconductor wafers  computer hard disks and other objects 
non contact technology has largely displaced traditional contact gages  which can damage the wafer through physical contact 
the company s capacitive dimensional gaging technology is based on the measurement of the capacitance between a measurement probe and the surface of the object 
the capacitance varies as a precise function of the distance between the probe and the object being measured  permitting the distance to be measured with a precision of better than microns 
for example  in the measurement of a semiconductor wafer  two probes  one on each side of the wafer  map both wafer surfaces simultaneously 
electronic circuitry converts the probe capacitance signal into distance signals which are translated by the company s software to produce information concerning the wafer s thickness  flatness and shape 
ade s capacitive dimensional technology has a number of advantages over other non contact measurement methods 
unlike optical  magnetic or acoustic technologies  capacitive gaging is not significantly affected by environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity or by the optical properties and material characteristics of the wafer 
as a result  the company believes that its capacitive dimensional technology provides a superior combination of accuracy  precision and stability  greater bandwidth and a broader range of potential applications than these other technologies 
surface inspection technology the company uses optical methods to detect microscopic surface defects 
a finely focused laser beam is scanned over the surface of the wafer 
surface particles or defects cause some of the beam s energy to scatter 
sensitive detectors quantify this scattering signal  which is translated by the company s software to produce information about particles  microscratches  haze and other process induced defects on the wafer surface 
although the principles of the company s optical technology are similar to those used by other manufacturers  the company believes its theoretical modeling and patented optical engineering and proprietary software result in products having a superior combination of high sensitivity and throughput 
fourier transform infrared spectroscopy technology fourier transform infrared spectroscopy technology ftir is used in a broad range of laboratory applications for examining various technical properties of materials and chemicals 
on line technologies  inc  a connecticut based technology company  has licensed its ftir technology to ade for incorporation into metrology tools for the wafer market 
ade is integrating this technology  which primarily has been confined to laboratory devices  as a metrology module into its automated in line metrology tools in order to provide the increasing precision and accuracy needed to support the swof in the face of ever tightening epi specifications 
magnetics characterization technology the company s products for characterizing magnetic materials use a variety of non contact measurement technologies including lasers the kerr effect  vibrating sample and torque effect inductive sensing techniques 
the company believes its theoretical modeling and magnetics engineering enable it to offer automated products with superior sensitivity  speed  accuracy  and reproducibility 
proprietary software ade s proprietary software analyzes and transforms the large amounts of data generated by ade s metrology and inspection systems to produce information about process induced defects that aids in process control 
the flexible design of the software permits reconfiguration of the company s products to serve new applications with a minimum of hardware or software redesign or development

the company s research and development efforts are designed to enhance the company s current products and develop and introduce new products to keep pace with technological developments and respond to constantly evolving customer requirements 
the company devotes significant resources to programs directed towards developing new and enhanced products  as well as developing new applications for existing products 
as of april   the company employed a full time research and development staff of persons 
in fiscal years  and  the company s research and development expenditures were million  million and million respectively  representing  and of revenues 
research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries  project materials and other costs associated with the company s ongoing research and development efforts 
industry standards organizations  such as semiconductor equipment and materials international semi and american standards for testing and materials astm  are pivotal in defining the test methods  measurement parameters and specifications governing commercial transactions within the semiconductor industry 
the company maintains a significant presence on standards committees of semi  astm and other international standards organizations 
the company believes that its involvement with these organizations has helped to ensure that the company s new products conform to industry standards 
backlog backlog increased to approximately million at april  from million at april   as a result of increases in orders for the company s products 
the company schedules production based on firm customer commitments and anticipated orders during the planning cycle 
the company includes in its backlog only those customer orders for which it has accepted written purchase orders against which it expects to ship within the following twelve months 
all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty 
the company does not believe that the level of backlog is an accurate indicator of the company s future performance 
manufacturing the company s principal manufacturing activities take place at its iso registered facility near boston  massachusetts  where dimensional metrol ogy systems are manufactured  and charlotte  north carolina  where optical surface inspection equipment is manufactured 
certain of the company s gaging products for the computer disk and disk drive and other industries are manufactured in milpitas  california 
manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies which are supplied by third party vendors and then integrated into the company s finished products 
many of the components and subassemblies are standard products  although certain items are made to company specifications 
the company manufactures its semiconductor metrology and inspection systems in a cleanroom environment 
certain components and subassemblies  including certain system controllers and robotics components incorporated into the company s systems  are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers 
management routinely monitors single or limited source supply parts  and the company endeavors to ensure that adequate inventory is available to maintain manufacturing schedules should the supply of any part be interrupted 
although the company seeks to reduce its dependence on sole and limited source suppliers  it has not qualified a second source for these products and the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and damage customer relationships 
further  a significant increase in the list price of one or more of these components could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
competition the semiconductor and computer hard disk equipment industries are highly competitive 
while the company believes that it does not presently have significant established competitors in the metrology area of the semiconductor wafer equipment industry  there can be no assurance that companies with complementary technologies and greater financial resources will not enter the industry and develop products that are superior to the company s products or achieve market acceptance 
in the market for optical defect inspection equipment  the company competes directly with hitachi electronics engineering co  ltd 
and kla tencor corporation  both of which have significantly greater financial resources than the company 
in the metrology area of the device industry  the company has encountered  and expects to encounter in the future  competition from companies offering similar and competing technologies  some of which have significantly greater financial resources than the company or an existing market presence in the device industry  or both 
the company also expects to encounter intense competition in the areas of metrology and inspection for the hard disk industry 
the company s competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price performance characteristics 
competitive pressures can necessitate price reduction which can adversely affect operating results 
although the company believes that it has certain technical and other advantages over its competitors  maintaining such advantages will require a continued high level of investment by the company in research and development and sales  marketing and service 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investment or that the company will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages 
patents and other intellectual property rights the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and license agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products 
the company believes  however  that its success depends to a greater extent upon innovation  technological expertise and distribution strength 
the company requires each of its employees  including its executive officers  to enter into standard employee agreements pursuant to which the employee agrees to keep confidential all proprietary information of the company and to assign to the company all rights in any proprietary information or technology made or contributed by the employee during his or her employment or made thereafter as a result of any inventions conceived or work done during such employment 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use the company s products or technology without authorization or to develop similar technology independently 
in addition  effective patent  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
as of july   the company holds united states patents and foreign patents covering existing and potential products and has applied for additional patents in the united states and additional foreign patents 
the company has licensed its prealigner patents to a number of companies following the settlement of a patent infringement suit brought by the company 
the company is actively pursuing similar licensing arrangements with a number of other companies 
as is typical in the company s industry  the company and its customers from time to time receive letters from third parties  including some of the company s competitors  alleging infringement of such parties patent rights by the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company would prevail in any litigation seeking damages or expenses from the company or to enjoin the company from selling its products on the basis of such alleged infringement or that the company would be able to license any valid and infringed patents on reasonable terms 
employees as of april   the company employed a total of persons at all of its locations  including in manufacturing  in research and development  in marketing and sales  in customer service and in administration

risk factors an investment in the common stock of the company involves a high degree of risk 
investors and prospective investors should consider carefully the following risk factors and those discussed elsewhere in this report 
cyclicality of the company s business 
the company s business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor wafer and device and computer hard disk and disk drive manufacturers  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits  products utilizing integrated circuits and systems requiring hard disk drives  respectively 
the semiconductor and hard disk industries are cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns  which have had a severe effect on the demand for capital equipment 
two of the principal companies in the disk drive industry have recently announced less than expected demand for their disk drive products 
prior semiconductor and hard disk industry downturns and construction of excess capacity by the industry have adversely affected the company s revenues  gross margin and net income and have also adversely affected the market price for the company s common stock 
no assurance can be given that the company will continue to achieve the revenue growth it has experienced in recent years 
in addition  the need for continued investment in research and development and extensive customer service and support capability worldwide will limit the company s ability to reduce expenses in the event of a downturn in the industry 
fluctuations of quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied and may continue to vary significantly 
the company s quarterly revenues typically are derived from a relatively small number of customer orders 
these customer orders often consist of multiple systems  each of which are priced between approximately  and  as a result  the timing of significant orders or a reduction in the number of systems shipped in a quarter could have a material effect on the company s revenues and results of operations for that quarter 
the results for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors  including economic conditions in the semiconductor and hard disk industries  the timing of shipments of orders to major customers  the mix of products sold by the company  competitive pricing pressures and the company s ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a cost effective and timely basis 
moreover  customers may cancel or reschedule shipments  and production difficulties or the inability to obtain critical components could delay shipments 
in addition  the company s product sales have fluctuated  and are likely to continue to fluctuate  based on seasonal factors  such as customers capital budget approval cycles  among others 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company has increased its research and development spending in recent periods  in part to support its development of systems for next generation millimeter semiconductor wafers 
the company s expense levels are fixed in advance and based in part on its expectations as to future revenues 
as a consequence  any material shortfall in revenue in a given quarter could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings 
rapid technological change and introduction of new products 
the market for semiconductor wafer and device and computer hard disk metrology and inspection equipment is characterized by rapid technological advances  changing customer requirements  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the company s future success will depend in large part on the company s ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  achieve market acceptance and respond to customer requirements that are constantly evolving 
new product introductions may contribute to fluctuations in quarterly operating results  as customers may defer ordering products from the company s existing product lines 
if new products have reliability or quality problems  then reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable and additional service and warranty expense may result 
responding to rapid technological change and the need to develop and introduce new products to meet customers expanding needs and evolving industry standards will require the company to make substantial investments in research and product development 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements or any significant delays in product development or introduction could result in a loss of competitiveness and could materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that any product enhancements or new products developed by the company will gain market acceptance 
the semiconductor wafer industry is currently undergoing a gradual evolution from millimeter to millimeter wafers 
wafer manufacturers are beginning to establish pilot production lines and specifications for the manufacture of millimeter wafers 
the company is currently developing product enhancements and new products designed to meet increasing demand for metrology and inspection equipment for millimeter wafers 
one of the company s competitors recently began shipping an optical inspection product for millimeter wafers 
until the company begins shipping its next generation product  the company s sales of its wafer inspection systems could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop enhancements and new products successfully or in time to meet emerging demand  or that enhancements and new products developed by the company will be accepted by the company s customers 
competition 
the semiconductor and computer hard disk equipment industries are highly competitive 
there can be no assurance that companies with complementary technologies and greater financial resources will not enter these industries and develop products that are superior to the company s products or achieve market acceptance 
in the market for optical defect inspection equipment  the company competes directly with hitachi electronics engineering co  ltd 
and kla tencor corporation  both of which have significantly greater financial resources than the company 
in the metrology area of the device industry  the company has encountered  and expects to encounter in the future  competition from companies offering similar and competing technologies  some of which have significantly greater financial resources than the company or an existing market presence in the device industry  or both 
the company also expects to encounter intense competition in the areas of metrology and inspection for the hard disk industry 
the company s competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price performance characteristics 
competitive pressures often necessitate price reduction which can adversely affect operating results 
in order to remain competitive  the company must maintain a high level of investment in research and development and sales  marketing and service 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investment or that the company will be able to make the technological advances necessary to remain competitive 
currently  the company s lead times for the delivery of products to its customers are longer than the industry average  and  as a consequence  the company has in a limited number of cases failed to obtain customer orders 
although the company is taking steps to reduce lead times  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in sufficiently reducing its lead times 
the failure to sufficiently reduce lead times may result in lost business in the future and may have an adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
kla corporation recently acquired a competitor of the company in the market for optical defect inspection equipment  tencor corporation  to form kla tencor corporation 
the company expects that similar acquisitions and business combinations by competitors and potential competitors of the company  in the metrology as well as in the defect inspection markets  may continue in the future 
acquisitions by the company s competitors and potential competitors could allow them to offer new products without the lengthy time delays typically associated with internal product development  which could afford such competitors and potential competitors an advantage in meeting customers demands 
such acquisitions by others could also have the effect of limiting the company s access to commercially significant technologies 
the greater resources  including financial and marketing and support resources  of competitors engaged in these acquisitions could permit them to accelerate the development and commercialization of new competitive products and the marketing of existing competitive products to their larger installed bases 
accordingly  such business combinations and acquisitions by competitors and potential competitors could have an adverse impact on both the company s market share and the pricing of its products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company relies upon a combination of internal product development and partnerships with certain other companies to broaden its product line to meet customer demand 
the increasing competitiveness within the industry  together with acquisitions by the company and its competitors of businesses possessing complementary technologies  could materially limit the company s ability to continue to partner with other companies for new or complementary products  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s ability to offer in a timely manner products that meet customers needs 
management of growth 
the company has been experiencing a period of significant growth that could place a strain on its management and other resources 
to support the company s growth  the company will need to hire more engineering  manufacturing  sales and marketing  and support and administrative personnel  expand customer service capabilities  and update or expand management information systems  procedures and controls 
competition for the necessary personnel in the company s industries is high 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish its growth strategies or that it will be able to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion and satisfactorily support its customers and operations or that its information systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s operations 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
customer and industry concentration 
a relatively limited number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the company s revenues in each year 
in fiscal years  and  sales to the company s top five customers in each period  all of which are in the semiconductor wafer industry  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenue 
in fiscal  one of the company s customers accounted for of the company s revenue 
the loss of or any reduction in orders by any of these customers  including reductions due to market  economic or competitive conditions in the semiconductor industry or in other industries that manufacture products utilizing semiconductors  could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in each of the last three fiscal years the company has derived over of its revenue  including approximately in fiscal  from customers in the semiconductor wafer industry 
while the company is focusing on expanding the level of its business in the device and hard disk industries  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will be successful 
the company s ability to maintain or increase its sales levels in the future will depend in part upon its ability to obtain orders from new customers as well as the financial condition and success of its existing customers and the general economy 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or continue to increase the level of its revenues in the future or that the company will be able to retain existing customers or to attract new customers 
in addition  given the limited number of customers  any delay in collecting  or inability to collect  accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
dependence on suppliers 
certain of the components and subassemblies  including certain systems controllers and robotics components  incorporated in the company s systems are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers 
the company has not qualified a second source for these products and the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and damage customer relationships 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
risks associated with international operations 
international sales accounted for  and of the company s revenues for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of revenues 
the company s international business may be affected by changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates as well as by factors such as the risk of government financed competition  changes in trade policies  tariff regulations and difficulties in obtaining us export licenses 
patents and other intellectual property 
the company s success depends in part on its proprietary technology 
the company attempts to protect its proprietary technology through patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and license agreements 
the company believes  however  that its success will depend to a greater extent upon innovation  technological expertise and distribution strength 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technology or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
no assurance can be given that the claims allowed on any patents held by the company will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology 
in addition  no assurance can be given that any patents issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company 
in addition  effective patent  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
as is typical in the company s industry  the company and its customers from time to time receive letters from third parties  including some of the company s competitors  alleging infringement of such parties patent rights by the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company would prevail in any litigation seeking damages or expenses from the company or to enjoin the company from selling its products on the basis of such alleged infringement or that the company would be able to license any infringed patents on reasonable terms 
some customers using certain products of the company have received a notice of infringement from technivision corporation and jerome h 
lemelson  alleging that equipment used in the manufacture of semiconductor products infringes patents issued to mr 
lemelson relating to computer image analysis or digital signal generation and analysis 
certain of these customers have notified the company that they may seek indemnification from the company for any damages and expenses resulting from this matter 
neither the company nor any of its products has been identified by mr 
lemelson as infringing his patents 
there can be no assurance  however  that mr 
lemelson would not bring a claim against the company for infringement or that the company would prevail in any such action 
if mr 
lemelson were to prevail in any such action  the company might be required to pay license fees or royalties to mr 
lemelson  which could have an adverse impact on the company s profitability 
risks associated with acquisitions and alliances 
the company has addressed the need to offer new products  in part  through the acquisition of technology and other businesses 
the acquisition of other businesses involves numerous risks  including the difficulty of assimilating the operations  technologies and products of the acquired business  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience and must compete with competitors having stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business 
the integration of other businesses into ade requires  among other things  integration of product offerings and coordination of sales  marketing  research  development  and management organizations 
there can be no assurance that such integration will be accomplished smoothly or successfully 
the difficulties of such integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating organizations which are separated geographically 
the inability of management to successfully integrate the operations of such acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the company 
control by existing stockholders 
the company s directors and executive officers and members of their immediate families beneficially own over one third of the company s outstanding shares of common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders acting together have the ability to significantly influence corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of the company s directors 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company 
volatility of stock price 
the stock market in general and the market for shares of technology companies in particular recently have experienced extreme price fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
many companies in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries  including the company  experienced dramatic volatility in the market prices of their common stock during the last two years 
the company believes that factors such as announcements of developments related to the company s business or its competitors or customers businesses  fluctuations in the company s financial results  general conditions or developments in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries and the worldwide economy  sales of the company s common stock into the market  the number of market makers for the company s common stock  announcements of technological innovations or new or enhanced products by the company or its competitors or customers  a shortfall in revenue  gross margin  earnings or other financial results from or changes in analysts expectations and developments in the company s relationships with its customers and suppliers  or a variety of factors beyond the company s control could cause the price of the company s common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the company s common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations that are material  adverse and unrelated to the company s performance 
item properties the company s principal operations are located in an approximately  square foot company owned building in westwood  massachusetts  a  square foot building in newton  massachusetts under a five year lease that expires in may and a  square foot building in charlotte  north carolina under a ten year lease that expires in september the company also owns a  square foot building in burlington  massachusetts and leases space for sales and customer support offices in various other locations

overview the company was founded in to develop and market certain advanced concepts and designs in capacitive and other measurement technologies suitable for industrial applications requiring precise  reliable  damage free and repeatable measurements 
the company s products have evolved from single instruments used in off line engineering analysis to multi function systems for automated in line monitoring of process induced defects throughout the wafer and disk manufacturing processes 
the company operates in two major business areas  the semiconductor group and the computer disk group 
the semiconductor group manufactures multifunctional semiconductor metrology and automation systems and optical wafer defect inspection equipment used to detect particles and other defects on wafer surfaces 
the computer disk group is primarily engaged in the production of metrology systems for the computer hard disk industry 
a relatively limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of the company s revenue 
moreover  during the past fiscal year approximately of the company s revenue was derived from sales made to wafer manufacturers  with the remainder of the revenue derived principally from sales to manufacturers of semiconductor devices and computer hard disks 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a relatively small number of customer orders 
these customer orders often consist of multiple systems  which can range in price from approximately  to  as a result  the timing of significant orders or a reduction in the number of systems shipped in a quarter could have a material effect on the company s revenue and results of operations for that quarter 
the company records revenue from product sales upon shipment to the customer 
the company accrues for warranty costs upon shipment and recognizes service revenue when the service is performed 
revenue under certain long term contracts containing custom engineering is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
in february  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of and a building used by digital measurement systems  inc dms of burlington  massachusetts 
dms provides magnetic measurement equipment and systems to the computer hard disk manufacturing industry 
this transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and  therefore  the accompanying financial information has been retroactively restated to reflect the financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the company and dms for all periods presented 
results of operations for the periods indicated  the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenue represented by the respective line items in the company s consolidated statement of income 
year ended april  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and sales general and administrative 
income from operations other income expense net income fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenue 
revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased unit sales of the company s products 
the increase in unit sales resulted primarily from strong demand for capital equipment in the semiconductor industry and increased demand for gaging equipment in the computer disk drive industry 
in fiscal  million of revenue was provided by the operations of dms versus million in fiscal the company is currently developing product enhancements and new products designed to meet increasing demand for metrology and inspection equipment for millimeter wafers 
a competitor of the company has recently begun shipping an optical inspection product for millimeter wafers 
the company believes that its next generation product  which has not yet been shipped to customers  will be technologically superior to the competitor s new product 
until the company begins shipping its next generation product  the company s sales of its wafer inspection systems could be adversely affected 
gross margin 
gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily due to distributing relatively fixed overhead costs over increased sales 
gross margins were higher in the first and second quarters of fiscal  as the company operated near capacity in its facilities  as compared to the third and fourth quarters of fiscal during the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year  the company increased capacity and overhead by moving into a new facility in westwood  massachusetts and by increasing the capacity of its existing facility in charlotte  north carolina 
gross margins in the immediate future are expected to be consistent with the margins experienced during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal and increased as a percent of revenue to from 
this increase was primarily due to increased spending on next generation products and expenses recognized during the fourth quarter for products under development  a portion of which had been capitalized during the previous three quarters 
while future research and development expenses are expected to increase over previous quarters as the company continues development of next generation products  the company expects that expenses as a percent of revenue should return to levels experienced during the first three quarters of fiscal marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased as a percent of revenue to from 
general and administrative expenses increased at a lower rate than revenue growth  as these expenses are relatively stable compared to revenue growth 
other income expense 
net interest income was  in fiscal versus net interest income of  in fiscal interest income was offset by interest expense associated with an industrial development bond used to finance the acquisition and renovation of the westwood manufacturing facility 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively  and differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because of benefits from the use of a foreign sales corporation by the company and state income taxes 
the fiscal rate was lower than the fiscal rate due to the benefit of investment tax credits resulting from increased capital spending in fiscal and the benefit from federal and state research and development tax credits realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenue 
revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due to increased unit sales of the company s products and a price increase announced in january the increase in unit sales resulted primarily from strong demand for capital equipment in the semiconductor industry and increased demand for gaging equipment in the computer disk drive industry 
gross margin 
gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily due to distributing relatively fixed overhead costs over increased sales and a price increase announced in january  the impact of which occurred during fiscal research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal  as revenue increased at a rate greater than the increase in research and development expense 
total expense for research and development increased as the company made significant investments in next generation products 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase in expenditures was due to additions in staffing required to support increased demand for the company s products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due to higher bonus expenses associated with improved performance  higher employee benefit costs  increased legal fees associated with various legal matters and additional expenses associated with being a public company 
other income expense 
net interest income was  in fiscal versus net interest expense of  in fiscal the increase in income resulted from interest earned on the proceeds of the initial public offering of the company s common stock completed in october  repayment in full of the outstanding balance of the company s line of credit in fiscal and the cancellation of subordinated debt related to the exercise of warrants in connection with the initial public offering 
provision for income taxes

marketing and sales general and administrative income from operations interest income expense  net net income the company s quarterly operating results have varied and may continue to vary significantly due to a number of factors  including economic conditions in the semiconductor and computer hard disk industries  the timing of shipments of orders to major customers  the mix of products sold by the company and competitive pricing 
customers may cancel or reschedule shipments 
production difficulties or the inability to obtain critical components could delay shipments 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
as cost of revenue includes manufacturing overhead  which is relatively constant from quarter to quarter  gross margins can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to varying levels of production and revenue 
there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable in any future period 
marketing and sales expenses can vary from quarter to quarter based on a number of factors  including mix of sales channels  geographic mix and timing of marketing events 
liquidity and capital resources as of april   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million 
net income was million 
this amount was offset by a million increase in accounts receivable resulting from increased sales and a million increase in inventory 
management believes that inventory levels are larger than necessary for current sales volumes and has instituted a number of programs to improve inventory turnover in all facilities 
depreciation and amortization for fiscal was million 
during fiscal  the company increased its ownership in its japanese distributor  japan ade ltd 
jal  from to 
consequently  in fiscal  million in gross profit from sales to jal have been deferred rather than included in income from operations 
during fiscal  million of cash was used in investing activities 
purchases of fixed assets represented million of this amount 
during the next fiscal year  the company does not anticipate investing in fixed assets to the extent of fiscal investments in three companies used an additional million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million 
the primary source of this cash was a million industrial development bond used to finance the purchase and renovation of the manufacturing facility in westwood  massachusetts 
since inception  the company has satisfied its cash requirements primarily through cash flow from operations  private placements and an initial public offering of the company s common stock  bank borrowings and equipment financing 
on july   the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a registration statement on form s with respect to a public offering by the company of up to  shares of common stock and by certain stockholders of the company of up to  shares of common stock  in each case including an underwriters overallotment option of 
the company may use a portion of the net proceeds to the company from the offering for acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
the company believes that cash from operations  existing cash resources and bank borrowings  together with the net proceeds of the sale of common stock by the company in the offering  will be adequate to fund operations for at least the next months 
the company s long term capital requirements will be affected by many factors  including the success of the company s current product offerings  the company s ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and general trends in the semiconductor wafer and device industries 
the company plans to finance its long term capital needs with the net proceeds of the currently pending public offering  together with existing cash reserves and interest earned thereon  revenue from product sales  bank loans  leases and debt financings 
to the extent that such funds are insufficient to finance the company s activities  or if the public offering is not completed  the company will have to raise additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or through other means 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms
