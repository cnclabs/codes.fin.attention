except for historical information contained herein  the matters discussed below contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to economic  competitive  governmental and technological factors affecting the company s operations  markets and profitability 
in addition  expectations are based on certain assumptions  among them that revenues from the acquired businesses will not decline materially from prior years and that the company s contract backlog will not be materially adversely impacted by unforeseen events 
should these assumptions prove to be in error  the company s results could differ materially from those expected 
overview general the company s strategy is to capture an increased share of the market for outsourced network installation  maintenance and system integration services related to fiber optic  coaxial and digital network infrastructure 
the company believes that customers will continue to require such services due to advancements in technology and developments in the telecommunications  computer and media industries 
this strategy includes plans to grow existing and complimentary lines of business and to acquire other communication services companies with high quality management and strong performance records and to integrate such acquired operations into the company s existing operations 
management believes that such acquisitions will enable the company to improve economies of scale  increase gross margins  and become a leading provider of communications infrastructure services 
during fiscal  the company implemented a number of strategic initiatives to achieve growth and improve operating efficiencies and profitability 
such initiatives commenced with the reorganization of the company s corporate structure into operational groups and was followed by the completion of several strategic acquisitions and the integration of those businesses into the company s operations 
for fiscal year  the company expects to continue an aggressive growth strategy with a portfolio of profitable core and complementary businesses 
the success of the company s growth strategy will depend in part upon the company s obtaining an expanded debt facility  which it is currently seeking  and additional equity capital 
in december  the company raised  through the issuance of convertible preferred equity securities effected through a private placement and  from a bank loan in connection with an acquisition  both of which are more fully described below 
although the company believes that additional financing will be obtained  there can be no assurance that such can be obtained or obtained on terms favorable to the company 
in addition  the company s growth strategy contains certain inherent risks including maintaining the organizational infrastructure to support rapid growth and the integration and management of new acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the company s growth strategy will be successful
