the company expects to recognize increasing benefits from these expenditures in interest expense interest expense of million in increased by million from the level

gross profit fisher s gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the comparable period in the increase in gross profit is attributable primarily to additional sales volume of recent acquisitions 
the gross profit growth in the company s base north american distribution businesses was partially offset by lower sales and gross margins of manufactured laboratory workstations

operations outside of the united states had significantly higher selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales as compared with that of fisher s domestic operations for the period 
these higher costs are being incurred as part of a plan to develop an integrated worldwide supply capability  the benefit of which has not been realized 
restructuring charge in the third quarter of  the company recorded a pretax restructuring charge of million as previously discussed 
certain costs resulting from the temporary duplication of operations  relocation of inventories  relocation of employees  hiring and training new employees  other start up costs and redundant costs  which will be eliminated as the plan is implemented  are not included in the restructuring charge and are recognized in selling  general and administrative expense as incurred 
approximately million of such charges were recorded in and are included in selling  general and administrative expense

the decrease in cash flow from working capital was primarily attributable to receivables and accounts payable 
the increase in receivables  which decreased cash flow  was due to increases in sales volume and the impact of the integration of cms into fisher 
the decrease in accounts payable  which also decreased cash flow  was due to an unusually high balance at december  due to initial stocking for new product lines and timing of payments 
the company s operating working capital defined as receivables plus inventories less accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase is primarily due to increases in receivables discussed above and increases in inventories due to sales volume and stocking related to new logistics centers in north america

environmental matters some of fisher s operations involve and have involved the handling  manufacture or use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of applicable environmental laws 
consequently  some risk of environmental and other damage is inherent in particular operations and products of fisher  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses  and there can be no assurance that material damage will not occur or be discovered to have occurred or be determined to be material in the future 
the company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation relative to environmental protection matters 
the company maintains two facilities in the state of new jersey  in fair lawn and bridgewater  that are the subject of administrative consent orders  issued pursuant to new jersey s environmental clean up and responsibility act ecra now called the industrial site recovery act isra in connection with prior transfers of a controlling interest in the company  which require that certain remediation and other activities be undertaken at these sites 
the fair lawn facility is also part of a site listed on the superfund national priority list under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla 
fisher has also been notified that it is among the potentially responsible parties under cercla or similar state laws for the costs of investigating and or remediating contamination caused by hazardous materials at certain other sites 
the company s non superfund liabilities for environmental matters are principally related to compliance with ecra isra administrative consent orders and other environmental regulatory requirements such as the clean air act  the clean water act and other generally applicable requirements 
the potential costs related to environmental matters and the possible impact on future operations are difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup  the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations  the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company s responsibility 
accruals for environmental liabilities are recorded  based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated 
estimates are established based upon management s knowledge to date and its experience with the foregoing environmental matters  and include potential costs for investigation  remediation  operation and maintenance of cleanup sites and related capital expenditures 
accrued liabilities for environmental matters were million and million at december  and  respectively 
although these amounts do not include third party recoveries  certain sites may be subject to indemnification 
although the ultimate liability with respect to these matters cannot be determined with certainty  in view of the company s financial condition and the environmental accruals established  and based on information currently available  management does not believe that the ultimate liability related to these environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
however  future events  such as changes in existing laws and regulations  changes in agency direction or enforcement policies  or changes in the conduct of fisher s operations  may give rise to additional compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
financial instruments the company s financial instruments consist primarily of cash in banks  investments in marketable securities  accounts receivable and debt 
in addition  the company has forward currency contracts that hedge certain firm commitments and balance sheet exposures 
see notes and of notes to financial statements for additional information 
dividends the company paid a quarterly cash dividend of per share for each of the quarterly periods of fiscal years and the company anticipates paying regular quarterly dividends of per share  which will be funded by cash generated from operations and will be subject to review by the company s board of directors from time to time in light of  among other things  the company s earnings  financial position and other relevant business considerations 
no dividend will be payable unless declared by the company s board of directors and funds are legally available for payment 
at december   retained earnings were free from dividend restrictions 
financial condition at december   current assets decreased million from december   with reductions in cash and cash equivalents and other current assets of million and million  respectively  offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and inventories of million 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from capital expenditures related to the consolidation and relocation of logistical facilities in north america and repayments on the company s bank credit facility 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to increases in sales volume and the impact of the integration of cms into fisher 
the increase in inventories is due to increased sales volume and stocking related to new logistics centers in north america 
the reduction in other current assets reflects decreases in deferred taxes primarily due to restructuring and integration spending 
long term assets increased by million  primarily due to increases in goodwill resulting from recent acquisitions and the final allocation of the purchase price of cms and fse 
long term debt decreased by million  primarily due to the conversion and redemption of the company s million step up convertible subordinated notes due and a reduction in the amount outstanding under the bank credit facility 
stockholders equity increased by million primarily due to the conversion of the convertible notes and net income

such forward looking statements involve certain risks that are beyond the company s control  and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward looking statements 
the future operating results  performance or achievements of the company may be affected by a number of factors  including without limitation  the following the company operates in a market that is highly competitive 
the company s competitors include other distributors as well as a large number of suppliers and manufacturers that sell their own products directly to end users 
some of these competitors are larger and may have greater resources than the company 
the company s ability to implement its business strategy will depend on numerous factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
much of the company s recent sales growth was the result of acquisitions  including the acquisition of cms and fse 
in addition  much of the expected improvement in the company s profitability is dependent upon completing the remaining phases of the integration of cms and fse and the restructuring plan 
the largest ongoing activity is the consolidation of logistics facilities which is inherently complex and is based on a scheduled timetable which could be delayed due to business conditions or other factors 
delays such as this could result in a temporary increase in costs which could slow realization of the improvement in profitability 
future growth and profitability will be largely dependent on growth in the overall market for instruments  supplies and equipment  and environmental testing  life sciences  worker safety and emerging testing techniques and the ability of the company to make acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that such growth will occur or that suitable acquisition candidates will be available or that any acquisition will be successful 
some of the company s operations involve and have involved the handling  manufacture or use of many substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of applicable environmental and other laws 
some risk of environmental and other damage or hazard is inherent in particular operations and products manufactured  sold or distributed by the company 
there can be no assurance that damage  hazard or loss will not occur 
to a large extent such damage is uninsured 
the company continually monitors and reviews its procedures and policies for compliance with existing law and the cost of compliance with existing environmental laws is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings  liquidity or competitive position 
however  future events  including changes in existing laws and regulation changes in agency direction or enforcement policies  or changes in the conduct of the company s operations may give rise to additional costs that are currently unintended and unforeseen and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the company conducts international operations with a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries  majority owned subsidiaries  joint ventures  equity interests and agents located in north and south america  europe  the far east  the middle east and africa

any international operations established by the company will be subject to risks similar to those affecting its north american operations in addition to a number of other risks  including lack of complete operating control  lack of local business experience  foreign currency fluctuations  language and other cultural barriers and political and economic instability 
the company expects that its current cash and cash equivalents and funds available under its credit facilities will be sufficient to fund its ongoing operating and capital expenditure requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional sources of financing as a result of unanticipated cash needs  acquisitions or other opportunities or disappointing operating results or that such required funds will be available to the company on satisfactory terms 
management is in the process of evaluating the potential effect on its computer systems resulting from the so called year problem 
the problem exists when dates are recorded using two digits rather than four and are then used for arithmetic operations  comparisons or sorting 
a two digit date recording may recognize a date using as rather than  which could cause the company s computer systems to perform inaccurate computations 
under the company s ongoing program to enhance systems capabilities  management is implementing a plan to resolve the potential issues associated with the year problem 
the costs of the modifications and enhancements  which are not known at this time  will be expensed as incurred
