actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors described herein and in other documents 
readers should carefully review the risk factors described in the documents the company files from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  specifically the quarterly reports on form q to be filed by the company in and any current reports on form k filed by the company 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
all information is based on the company s fiscal calendar 
selected elements of informix s financial statements are shown below for the last three years as a percentage of revenue and as a percentage change from year to year 
increase decrease percent of net revenue years ended december  compared compared to to licenses services net revenues cost and expenses cost of software distribution cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative merger expenses total costs and expenses operating income net income operating results informix s operating income was affected negatively in as a result of operating expenses growing more rapidly than revenues  primarily in the north america region as informix continues to invest heavily in personnel in the areas of sales  marketing and customer service  and research and development and due to integration expenses and fees associated with the acquisition of illustra information technologies  inc illustra as a pooling of interests in february in december  informix began shipping the informix universal server  based on informix s proven dynamic scaleable architecture tm dsa and providing extensibility to handle the broad range of datatypes not managed effectively by traditional relational databases 
this product merges the technology of illustra and informix 
informix incurred significant marketing expenses in connection with the initial announcement and launch of the universal server in the company expects selling and marketing expenses in to be at a level comparable to both in support of informix universal server and as informix continues developing specific market channels and specific products for such channels 
these development  integration and marketing expenses and the relatively low operating margins of illustra have adversely affected informix s ability to achieve operating margins consistent with and in the near term  these development and marketing efforts will continue to negatively affect the company s operating margins 
revenues the company derives revenues principally from licensing its software and from providing technical product services to customers 
license revenues may involve the shipment of product by the company or the granting of a license to a customer to manufacture products 
service revenue consists of customer telephone or direct support  update rights for new product versions  consulting  and training fees 
the company s products are sold directly to end user customers or through resellers  including original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors  and value added resellers vars including application vendors 
prior to  the company s customer mix had been decreasing in the distributor and hardware oem channels in favor of the end user and application vendor channels 
however  in  this trend shifted towards a higher proportion of oem sales as the company has increased the focus on its partnerships with several hardware vendors in order to utilize their sales forces  obtain access to their installed bases in certain industries and benefit from their consulting and systems integration organizations 
the increased focus on oem sales coupled with increases in the other reseller channels resulted in total reseller sales representing half of the company s license revenue 
the company estimates that almost half of the licenses sold to these resellers in were not resold to end users prior to december  if these resellers do not commit to licensing the same level of products for resale to end users in future periods  the company s future revenues could be adversely affected 
the company sold approximately million of software licenses to certain vendors during where the company concurrently committed to acquire goods or services in approximately the same dollar amount 
the company s license sales transactions can be relatively large in size and difficult to forecast both in timing and dollar value 
as a result  these transactions have caused fluctuations in net revenues and net income because of the relatively high gross margin on such revenues 
as is common in the industry  a disproportional amount of the company s license revenue is derived from transactions that close in the last few weeks of a quarter 
the timing of closing large license agreements also increases the risk of quarter to quarter fluctuations 
the company expects that these sorts of transactions and the resulting fluctuations will continue 
the overall revenue growth in compared to primarily reflects continued acceptance of the company s server products 
the company s revenues  along with those of the relational database management system rdbms industry as a whole  have shown substantial growth over the last several years 
the industry has benefited from trends to downsize from large proprietary computer systems and market acceptance of unix r  windows tm  windows nt tm and other open operating environments 
the quarterly revenue growth rates and the geographical growth trends rates slowed during the latter half of and there can be no assurances that growth rates in will be comparable with those achieved in informix s current server product line debuted in the fall of with informix online dynamic server for sequent dsa and was expanded to a wide array of unix based multi processor systems in december this product is now available on windows nt operating systems and accounts for a majority of the company s server sales 
in the spring of  the company introduced a workgroup version of this product named informix online workgroup server 
in fall  the company released informix online extended parallel server  designed for very high end use in loosely coupled computer architectures 
in late  the first version of informix universal server was released which was the combination of the informix online dynamic server product with the illustra server product 
the license revenue growth in compared to reflects strong demand for the company s server products  particularly the company s flagship database server  informix online dynamic server tm 
in addition  many informix partners  including oem resellers  purchased high volumes of product to resell in anticipation of customer demand 
the company believes that the license revenues derived from its database tool products declined from to primarily as a result of competitive product offerings from other companies and an increase in the company s sales to resellers  which traditionally have concentrated on purchases of database server products 
the increase in service revenue was primarily attributable to the continued growth of the company s installed customer base  and resulting renewal of maintenance contracts and increased consulting revenue 
the company continues to emphasize support services as a source of revenue 
as the company s products become more complex  more support services will be required 
the company intends to satisfy this requirement through internal support  third party services and oem support 
the contribution margin on service revenue decreased from percent in to percent in the decrease resulted from increased costs incurred to expand the support function due to sales increases and the continuing complexity of the products 
in addition  sales through the reseller channel where the product has not been resold to end users has not yet resulted in service revenue 
approximately percent  percent and percent of informix s net revenues were derived from sales to foreign customers in   and  respectively 
the increase in foreign revenues in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to continued international acceptance for informix s new and existing server products  and the establishment of new subsidiaries and sales offices in europe  asia pacific  japan  and latin america 
over the past few quarters  revenue continued to be stronger in europe  but weaker in japan 
informix expects that foreign revenues will continue to provide a significant portion of total revenues 
however  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the strength of local economies  and the general volatility of software markets may result in a higher or lower proportion of foreign revenues in the future 
in europe  asia pacific  and japan  most revenues and expenses are now denominated in local currencies 
the us dollar strengthened in the fourth quarter and for the year against the major european and asia pacific currencies  which resulted in lower revenue and expenses recorded when translated into us dollars  compared with the prior year periods 
the company has also increased its direct presence in latin america  although a significant percentage of this region s revenue is still denominated in us dollars 
although the effect was not significant in  the company has experienced significant currency fluctuations in mexico  and to a lesser extent  other latin american countries  and expects such fluctuations may occur in the future 
the company s operating and pricing strategies take into account changes in exchange rates over time  however  the company s results of operations may be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on accounts receivable or accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies until such receivables are collected or payables are disbursed 
this program involves the use of forward foreign exchange contracts in the primary european and asian currencies 
the company operates  on a limited basis  in certain countries in latin america  eastern europe  and asia pacific where there are limited forward currency exchange markets and thus the company has limited unhedged transaction exposures in these currencies 
the company does not attempt to hedge the translation to us dollars of foreign denominated revenues and expenses not yet earned or incurred 
informix s distribution markets are organized into three general markets north america  europe  which includes the middle east and africa  and the intercontinental group  consisting of latin america  japan  and the asia pacific region 
the north america  europe  and intercontinental group organizations contributed percent  percent and percent of informix s net revenues respectively  in  compared to percent  percent and percent  respectively  in  and percent  percent and percent  respectively  in in  the american institute of certified public accountants issued an exposure draft on software revenue recognition that is proposed to supersede the statement of position the company is evaluating the exposure draft in relation to its current revenue recognition policy 
certain provisions of the exposure draft differ from the company s current policy 
adoption of the exposure draft in its final form may significantly affect the revenue recognition practices of informix and could significantly alter  either favorably or unfavorably  the timing of revenue recorded under the company s current policy 
cost of software distribution dollars in millions change change manufactured cost of software distribution percentage of license revenue amortization of capitalized software percentage of license revenue cost of software distribution percentage of license revenue software distribution costs consist primarily of manufacturing and related costs such as media  documentation  product assembly and purchasing costs  freight  customs  and third party royalties  and amortization of previously capitalized software development costs and any write offs of previously capitalized software costs that are no longer realizable 
excluding amortization of previously capitalized software development costs  cost of software distribution as a percentage of license revenue was percent for both and in the future  the cost of software distribution as a percentage of revenue may vary depending upon whether the product is reproduced by the company or by its customers 
amortization of capitalized software increased percent in compared to due to the release of several products in the latter half of and amortization expense will continue to rise in absolute dollars in due to product releases including informix universal server 
the absolute value of amortization of capitalized software will vary from quarter to quarter as new products are released and other product development costs become fully amortized 
cost of services dollars in millions change change cost of services percentage of service revenue cost of services consists primarily of maintenance  consulting and training expenses 
the increase in cost of services in in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues compared to the prior year is primarily due to the company s expansion of consulting and support service capabilities as products have become more complex 
the increase in cost of services as a percentage of net service revenue is due to increases in support personnel in anticipation of additional consulting revenue as more customers utilize the company s products in more complex applications 
the company has also subcontracted certain service projects which reduces margins 
sales and marketing expenses dollars in millions change change sales and marketing percentage of net revenue the increase in sales and marketing expenses in in absolute dollars compared to was a result of the addition of new sales offices and sales personnel worldwide as the company expanded its worldwide direct sales organizations  the opening of new subsidiaries  higher commission expense associated with the increase in revenues  and increased marketing programs associated with new product launches 
as a percentage of net revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased from percent in to percent in with the expected continuing expansion in of worldwide operations  as well as increased sales and marketing expenditures aimed at positioning the company and its new and existing products in the marketplace  the company expects that sales and marketing expenses for will increase 
the increase in sales and marketing expense will include depreciation of equipment  and facilities and manpower costs associated with operating the company s information superstores  which are more fully discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
research and development expenses informix accounts for its software development expenses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
this statement requires that  once technological feasibility of a developing product has been established  all subsequent costs incurred in developing that product to a commercially acceptable level be capitalized and amortized ratably over the revenue life of the product 
the following table summarizes research and development costs for the prior three years dollars in millions change change incurred product development costs expenditures capitalized research and development expenses expenditures capitalized as percent of incurred the increase in research and development expenditures in absolute dollars from year to year is attributed to an increase in staff working on new products and product extensions  including the company s latest product informix universal server 
the higher capitalization in absolute dollars of product development expenditures from year to year resulted from an increase in the work involved in projects reaching technological feasibility as they neared their release dates 
significant programs currently under development include improvements and enhancements of current products  with particular emphasis on parallel computer architecture  user defined database extensions  web technology integration  and graphic desktop and systems administration 
the company believes that research and development expenditures are essential to maintaining its competitive position in its primary markets and expects the expenditure levels to continue to constitute a significant percentage of revenues 
general and administrative expenses dollars in millions change change general and administrative expenses percentage of net revenues general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars in compared to as a result of the continued expansion of the company s international operations 
general and administrative expenses in increased in absolute dollars compared to as a result of the continued expansion in international operations as well as the acquisition of several foreign distributors 
merger expenses in the first quarter of  the company recorded expenses of approximately million as a result of the acquisition of illustra  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
these costs consisted primarily of investment banking  legal and accounting fees 
interest income dollars in millions change change interest income percentage of net revenues the increase in absolute dollars from to and to results from higher balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  offset by slightly lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes dollars in millions change change provision for income taxes effective tax rate informix s effective tax rates for fiscal years   and are less than the combined federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the permanent reinvestment of a portion of the offshore earnings of informix s lower taxed irish operations and the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit 
the amount considered permanently invested in the irish operations may vary from year to year and may affect informix s effective tax rate 
informix anticipates its fiscal effective tax rate to remain approximately the same as  however  this rate could change based on a change in the geographic mix of informix s financial results  the amount of permanent reinvestment of a portion of the offshore earnings of informix s lower taxed irish operations  the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit which is scheduled to expire in and acquisitions by the company 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation on the company s financial position has not been significant 
liquidity and capital resources dollars in millions cash  cash equivalents  and investments working capital cash provided by operations cash used in investment activities  excluding investments of excess cash cash provided by financing activities cash generated by operations provided sufficient resources to fund the company s headcount growth and capital asset needs in all periods presented 
in addition  sufficient cash was generated in to finance the company s strong commitment to training and marketing efforts surrounding the acquisition of illustra and the development and release of informix universal server 
the increases in cash and cash equivalents provided by operations in compared with and in compared with  were primarily attributable to higher income before depreciation and amortization charges 
net accounts receivable increased by million in as compared to december days sales outstanding increased from approximately days in december to days in december the days sales outstanding ratio is dependent on many factors  including the mix of contract based revenue with significant oems and large corporate and government end users versus revenue recognized on shipments to application vendors and distributors and the success of the company s third party accounts receivable financing programs 
the company has programs whereby third party financing institutions provide financing for extended credit terms instead of such financing being provided by the company 
the company at times enhances its cash position through certain financing activities related to its account receivables 
excluding investments of excess cash  net cash and cash equivalents used for investing activities increased in compared with  the decrease in corporate acquisition activity the company acquired percent of the database division of ascii corporation in the first quarter of was offset by investments in property and equipment and in software development costs 
in  and  the company acquired million  million and million  respectively  of capital equipment consisting primarily of computer equipment  computer software and office equipment 
the increase of capital equipment purchases in resulted from the company s investments in capital equipment used in sales and product demonstration activities and an effort to improve the level of consulting and support services provided to customers  and to provide technology infrastructure for the company s growing employee headcount 
informix plans to continue to launch a series of information superstores worldwide which demonstrate and offer the most recent informix technology advances 
along with the core informix product line  these locations have tools from leading third party tools and application vendors installed on a wide variety of hardware platforms 
initial participants include data general  hewlett packard  ibm  ncr  pyramid  sequent  silicon graphics  and sun  among others 
engineers from both the informix professional services and the informix advanced technology group are working with prospects and customers at the superstores to create information technology prototypes  such as pilot data warehouses  based on comprehensive  proven methodology 
to date  the company has spent approximately million and has committed to spend approximately an additional million in the acquisition of capital equipment to support the launch of the information superstores the company expects to make further capital equipment expenditures against these commitments in the company s investments in software costs were previously discussed under results of operations 
in january  the company acquired a percent interest in the database division of ascii corporation  a distributor of its products in japan 
the company acquired the remaining percent interest in january the acquisition was recorded as a purchase 
the purchase price of ascii s database division was approximately million  of which approximately million has been allocated to intangible assets acquired 
in april  the company acquired an percent interest in the database division of daou corporation  a distributor of its products in korea 
the company acquired the remaining percent in january for approximately million 
the acquisition was recorded as a purchase 
the initial purchase price of this business was approximately million  and was increased by approximately million in january due to performance incentives outlined in the agreement  a total of approximately million has been allocated to intangible assets acquired 
the operating results of these distributors subsequent to the acquisition dates have been included in the consolidated results of operations 
in february  the company acquired illustra  a us based company that provides dynamic content management database software and tools for managing complex data in the internet  multimedia entertainment  financial services  earth sciences  and other markets 
approximately million shares of informix common stock were issued to acquire all outstanding shares of illustra stock 
an additional million shares of informix common stock were reserved for issuance in connection with the assumption of illustra s outstanding stock options and warrants 
the transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and accordingly all of the accompanying financial statements have been restated to reflect the merger as of the beginning of the earliest period presented 
merger expenses of approximately million were recorded in the first quarter of net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities in and consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of the company s common stock to employees  partially offset by payments on capital leases 
net cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities in included payments on capital leases and repurchases of the company s common stock  offset by proceeds from the sale of the company s common stock to employees 
in and  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of the company s common stock in the open market 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares with an aggregate cost of approximately million on the open market 
all repurchased shares were re issued to partially satisfy requirements under stock option and stock purchase plans 
in  the company rescinded the stock repurchase authorization 
the company plans on relocating its corporate headquarters to santa clara  california approximately miles to the south of the company s current headquarters 
to facilitate the move  in january  the company entered into a two year lease for twenty seven acres of undeveloped commercial real estate the real estate lease 
upon termination of the lease term  the company will have the option to purchase the land  or if such purchase option is not exercised  arrange for the sale of the parcels to an unrelated third party 
in the event the latter option is exercised  the company is required to pay the lessor any difference between the net sales proceeds and the lessor s investment in the parcels  approximately million 
in order to secure performance of its obligation under the lease  the company was required to pledge certain cash collateral to the lessor throughout the full term of the lease 
accordingly  in january  the company deposited million in cash into a non interest bearing collateral account controlled by an affiliate of the lessor 
interest on these deposits computed at market rates  otherwise due to the company  have been assigned by the company to the lessor in order to reduce the gross monthly lease payments due under the lease 
the resulting net monthly lease payments will be recognized by the company as rent expense over the lease term 
the real estate lease also includes certain financial performance criteria which must be met by the company during the lease term 
construction of buildings on the santa clara site will be phased over time based on the company s utilization needs 
the company intends to fund construction costs through outside financing  the availability of which has not been determined 
in addition  in november  the company leased approximately  square feet of office space in santa clara adjacent to the twenty seven acres described above 
the lease term is for fifteen years and minimum lease payments amount to million over the term 
the minimum lease payments are scheduled to increase within a contractual range based on changes in the consumer price index 
after giving consideration to the company s planned financing of construction costs in santa clara  the company expects that current balances of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to fund anticipated levels of operations at least through and may be used for investments and acquisitions to supplement internal revenue growth and for other corporate purposes 
business risks fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s operating results can vary substantially from period to period 
the timing and amount of the company s license revenues are subject to a number of factors that make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter extremely uncertain 
the company has operated historically with little or no backlog and  as a result  license revenues in any quarter are dependent on contracts entered into or orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
the company s operating margins have generally followed a historic pattern  with second half revenues and operating margins being higher than those of the preceding first half 
the company believes that this pattern has been primarily related to customers capital spending cycles at the end of a calendar year as well as to the company s selling efforts  influenced by annual sales incentive plans which culminate at the end of the calendar year  which is the end of the company s fiscal year 
additionally  as is common in the industry  a disproportionate amount of the company s license revenues are derived from transactions that close in the last few weeks of a quarter 
the timing of closing large license agreements also increases the risks of quarter to quarter fluctuations and the uncertainty of estimating quarterly operating results 
the company s operating expenditures are guided by projected annual and quarterly revenue levels and are incurred approximately ratably throughout each quarter 
as a result  if projected revenues are not realized in the expected period  the company s operating results for that period would be adversely affected as the operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
the company s revenue generation is also highly dependent on the economic conditions 
if the economy were to slow down  existing and potential customers might delay the purchase of the company s products  which would negatively affect the company s revenue 
failure to achieve revenue  earnings and other operating and financial results as forecasted or anticipated by brokerage firm analysts or industry analysts could result in an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
further  the company may not learn of  or be able to confirm  revenue or earnings shortfall until the end of each quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
volatility of informix stock prices 
the market for the company s common stock is highly volatile 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating and financial results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  changes in prices of the company s or its competitors products and services  changes in product mix  change in the company s revenue and revenue growth rates for the company as a whole or for individual geographic areas  business units  products or product categories  as well as other events or factors 
statements or changes in opinions  ratings  or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the market in which the company does business or relating to the company specifically have resulted  and could in the future result  in an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price for the securities of many high technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
personnel changes 
the company s future performance will depend to a significant extent on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled sales  consulting  technical  marketing and management personnel 
the competition for employees in the database software industry is intense  and the company expects that such competition will continue for the foreseeable future 
from time to time the company has experienced difficulty in locating candidates with appropriate qualifications 
the company also believes stock options are a critical component for motivating and retaining its key employees 
the recent decline in the price of the company s common stock has made stock options previously granted with higher exercise prices less valuable to the company s current employees and has consequently made it more difficult for the company to retain its key employees 
the failure of the company to attract and retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
competition 
the market for the company s software products and services is extremely competitive 
some of the company s current competitors have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
the industry movement to new operating systems  like windows nt  access through low end desktop machines  and access to data through the internet may cause downward pressure on prices of database and related products 
if such downward pressure on prices were to occur  margins would be adversely affected 
also  new or enhanced products introduced by existing or future competitors could have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
existing and future competition or changes in the company s product or service pricing structure or product or service offerings could result in an immediate reduction in the prices of the company s products or services 
if significant price reductions in the company s products or services were to occur and not be offset by increases in sales volume  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete successfully with its existing competitors or will be able to compete successfully with new competitors 
technological change and new products 
the market for the company s products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions 
the company s success will depend upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis and that meet dynamic customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products or enhancing its existing products or that such new or enhanced products will receive market acceptance or be delivered timely to the market 
the company has experienced product delays in the past and may experience delays in the future 
delays in the scheduled availability or a lack of market acceptance of its products or failure to accurately anticipate customer demand and meet customer performance requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing  new products or new versions of existing products will not contain undetected errors or bugs that will delay the introduction or commercial acceptance of such products 
a key factor in determining the success of the company will continue to be the ability of the company s products to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading  industry standard application software products intended to be used in connection with relational database management systems 
failure to meet existing or future interoperability and performance requirements of certain independent vendors marketing such applications in a timely manner could adversely affect the market for the company s products 
commercial acceptance of the company s products and services could also be adversely affected by critical or negative statements or reports by brokerage firms  industry and financial analysts and industry periodicals concerning the company  its products  business or competitors or by the advertising or marketing efforts of competitors  or other factors that could affect consumer perception 
international operations 
in and  approximately percent of the company s net revenues were derived from its international operations 
the company s operations and financial results could be significantly affected by factors associated with international operations such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and uncertainties relative to regional economic circumstances  as well as by other factors associated with international activities 
most of the company s international revenue and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
although the company takes into account changes in exchange rates over time in its pricing strategy  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
integration of acquired companies 
the company has completed several acquisitions during the last two years  including the database division of ascii corporation in japan  distributors in germany  korea and malaysia  stanford technology group  and  most recently  illustra in the united states 
the company may acquire other distributors  companies  products or technologies in the future 
there can be no assurance that these acquisitions can be effectively integrated  that such acquisitions will not result in costs and liabilities that could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition  or that the company will obtain the anticipated or desired benefits of such acquisitions 
infringement claims 
as the number of software products and software patents in the industry increases  the company believes that software developers like the company have and will become increasingly subject to infringement claims with respect to patents  trademarks and other proprietary rights 
such claims  with or without merit  can be time consuming and expensive to defend and could have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position  and cash flows
