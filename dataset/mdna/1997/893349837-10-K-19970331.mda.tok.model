item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations during the period from through  twa underwent two separate chapter reorganizations  the first in and the second in in connection with the reorganization  twa has applied fresh start reporting in accordance with sop which has resulted in the creation of a new reporting entity for accounting purposes and the company s assets and liabilities being adjusted to reflect fair values on the effective date 
a description of the adjustments to the financial statements arising from the consummation of the reorganization and the application of fresh start reporting is contained in note to consolidated financial statements 
for accounting purposes  the effective date is deemed to be september  because of the application of fresh start reporting  the financial statements for periods after the reorganization are not comparable in all respects to the financial statements for periods prior to the reorganization 
similarly  the consolidated financial statements for the periods prior to the reorganization are not consistent with periods subsequent to the reorganization 
as discussed below under liquidity and capital resources  pursuant to the reorganization  the company initially improved its financial condition and operating performance by  among other things  reducing labor and other operating and financing costs  rescheduling debt payments  recapitalizing the company s equity securities and certain of its debt  revising the company s route structure to capitalize further on its strength in st 
louis  and developing enhanced marketing systems 
pursuant to the reorganization  the company eliminated approximately million in face amount approximately million book value of debt from its balance sheet 
in addition  the final maturity of the icahn loans was extended from january  to january   and the company negotiated an aggregate of million of aircraft lease and conditional sale agreement deferrals for various periods of time  with a weighted average life of approximately two years 
through the second quarter of the company experienced improvements in its operating performance as operating income increased to million in the six months ended june   as compared to an operating loss of million in the same period of however  beginning in the third quarter of  the company s operating performance substantially deteriorated as the company s operating profit for the third quarter  typically the strongest period of the year  declined to million in the three months ended september   as compared to a combined operating profit excluding special charges and earned stock compensation charges aggregating million of million in the comparable period of the prior year 
the results for the fourth quarter of evidenced a further acceleration of this deterioration as the company reported an operating loss excluding special charges aggregating million of million  as compared to operating income of million in the same period of in the second half of  the company s revenues increased only  while capacity  measured in asms  increased by  as compared to the second half of operating costs  excluding earned stock compensation and special charges  increased over this same period 
the most significant increases were salaries  wages and benefits million  which reflected the increased number of employees  wage rate increases and additional overtime costs  fuel million  reflecting significantly higher units costs and increased usage  and maintenance costs 
notwithstanding the actions taken and planned by management to improve the company s future operating results as described below  management expects a large first quarter operating loss  which will significantly exceed that reported in the first quarter of in light of deterioration in the company s operating results  management has over the last several months refocused and accelerated certain aspects of its business strategy  including its fleet modernization and consolidation plan  route structure and facility improvements and efficiencies 
management believes that its recent operating results have been adversely affected by an overly aggressive increase in capacity  which when combined with unexpected maintenance delays and related costs  have negatively impacted schedule reliability resulting in excessive levels of flight cancellations and deterioration in its on time performance 
the company believes that this has adversely affected its unit revenues principally yields and costs 
in response to these issues  management has taken action to accelerate the phase out of all b and l aircraft  reduce low yield domestic jfk feed service  curtail and or eliminate historically unprofitable international routes and consolidate for the near term most of its jfk operations into a single terminal 
the above actions are designed to improve its operational performance and make its product more competitive to the business segment which offers higher yields 
the company has also curtailed the amount of contract maintenance services provided to third parties and redeployed those resources to twa s aircraft 
in connection with the above described plans  management has announced a comparable reduction in employee headcount 
management may undertake further actions to reduce costs which may result in additional reductions of the number of employees 
general the airline industry operates in an intensely competitive environment 
the industry is also cyclical due to  among other things  a close relationship of yields and traffic to general us and worldwide economic conditions 
small fluctuations in revenue per available seat mile rasm and cost per available seat mile casm can have a significant impact on the company s financial results 
the company has experienced significant losses excluding extraordinary items on an annual basis since the early s  except in when the company s combined operating profit was million 
factors contributing to these losses included  among other things  excess financial leverage  adverse publicity associated with the company s financial difficulties  excessive labor costs  the periods of a relatively weak economy  which resulted in weak air travel demand  poor operating performance  domestic pricing policies of other airlines  which decreased industry revenue yields and generated intense competition  and volatility in jet fuel costs 
the company s ability to improve its financial position and meet its financial obligations will depend upon a variety of factors  including  significantly improved operating results  favorable domestic and international airfare pricing environments  absence of adverse general economic conditions  more effective operating cost controls and efficiencies  and the company s ability to attract new capital and maintain adequate liquidity 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in generating the operating results or attracting new capital required for future viability 
the labor agreements become amendable after august  while the company cannot predict the precise wage rates that will be in effect at such time since such rates will be determined by subsequent events  the wage rates then in effect will likely increase 
however  management believes that it is essential that the company s labor costs remain favorable in comparison to its largest competitors 
see item business business strategy 
the company will seek to continue to improve employee productivity as an offset to any wage increases and will continue to explore other ways to control and or reduce operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining such productivity improvements or unit cost reductions 
in the opinion of management  the company s financial resources are not as great as those of most of its competitors  and therefore  any substantial increase in its labor cost as a result of any new labor agreements or any cessation or disruption of operation due to any strike or work action could be particularly damaging to the company 
as a result of the application of fresh start reporting as of the effective date  substantial values were assigned to routes  gates and slots million and reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets million 
the company has evaluated its future cash flows and  notwithstanding the operating loss experienced since the effective date  expects that the carrying value of the intangibles at december  will be recovered 
however  the achievement of such improved future operating results and cash flows are subject to considerable uncertainties 
in future periods these intangibles will be evaluated for recoverability based upon estimated future cash flows 
if expectations are not substantially achieved  charges to future operations for impairment of those assets may be required and such charges could be material 
there are a number of uncertainties relating to agreements with employees  the resolution of which could result in charges to future operating results of the company 
shares granted or purchased at a discount under the employee stock incentive program esip will generally result in a charge equal to the fair value of shares granted and the discount for shares purchased at the time when such shares are earned 
if the esip s target prices for the common stock are realized  the minimum aggregate charge for the years to would be approximately million based upon such target prices and the number of shares of common stock and employee preferred stock outstanding at december  the charge for any year  however  could be substantially higher if the market price of the common stock exceeds the target price for such year     and for the respective years to 
the allocation of approximately  shares of employee preferred stock issued to a trust for employees represented by alpa pursuant to the reorganization will also  when allocated to individual employees so represented in august  result in a charge of equal to the fair market value of the shares on the dates allocated 
pursuant to the labor agreements  the company agreed to pay to employees represented by the iam a cash bonus for the amount by which overtime incurred by the iam from september through august was reduced below specified thresholds 
this amount was to be offset by the amount by which medical savings during the period for the same employees did not meet certain specified levels of savings 
the obligation is payable in three equal annual installments beginning in the company has estimated the net overtime bonus owed to the iam to be approximately million and has reflected this amount as a noncurrent liability on the accompanying balance sheets 
such amount reflects a reduction of approximately million pursuant to an agreement to reduce proportionately the obligation based upon the size of the reduction of indebtedness achieved by the reorganization 
the iam  while not providing a calculation of its own  has disputed the method by which management has computed the net overtime bonus and has indicated that they believe the amount due to the iam is much greater than the amount which has been estimated by management 
in addition  in connection with certain wage increases afforded to non contract employees  employees represented by the iffa have asserted and won an arbitration ruling that  if sustained  would require that the company provide additional compensation to iffa represented employees 
the company estimates that at december  such additional compensation would aggregate approximately million 
the company denies any such obligation and intends to pursue an appeal of the arbitration ruling 
as such  no liability has been recorded by the company at december  in connection with the reorganization  the company entered into a letter agreement with employees represented by the alpa whereby if the company s flight schedule  as measured by block hours  does not exceed certain thresholds a defined cash payment would be made to the alpa 
the defined thresholds were exceeded during the measurement periods through december  and no amount was therefore owed to the alpa as of that date 
the company  however  anticipates that a liability will be incurred during as a result of the company s planned reductions in capacity 
the amount of the liability  if any  will be dependent on the amount by which the targeted block hours flown during the year exceed the actual block hours flown 
based upon current plans  management believes that its obligation under this agreement in will not exceed million 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
significant variations in annual operating revenues and operating expenses have been experienced historically by twa and are expected to continue in the future 
numerous uncertainties concerning the level of revenues and expenses always exist and it is not possible to predict the potential impact of such uncertainties upon twa s results of operations 
among the uncertainties that might adversely impact twa s future results of operations are i competitive pricing and scheduling initiatives  ii the availability and cost of capital  iii increases in fuel and other operating costs  iv insufficient levels of air passenger traffic resulting from  among other things  war  threat of war  terrorism or changes in the economy  v governmental limitations on the ability of twa to service certain airports and or foreign markets  vi regulatory requirements requiring additional capital expenditures  vii the outcome of certain upcoming labor negotiations  viii the possible reduction in yield due to a discount ticket program entered into by the company with karabu in connection with the reorganization  and ix the impact of the public s perception of the crash of twa flight see liquidity and capital resources 
the company s operating results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year due to seasonal fluctuations 
the second and third quarter results have historically been more favorable for the company due to increased leisure travel on both domestic and international routes during the spring and summer months 
on july   twa flight crashed shortly after departure from jfk en route to paris  france 
there were no survivors among the passengers and crew members aboard the b aircraft 
the company is cooperating fully with all federal  state and local regulatory and investigatory agencies to ascertain the cause of the crash  which to date has not been determined 
while twa is currently a defendant in a number of lawsuits relating to the crash  it is unable to predict the amount of claims which may ultimately be made against the company or how those claims might be resolved 
twa maintains substantial insurance coverage and  at this time  management has no reason to believe that such insurance coverage will not be sufficient to cover the claims arising from the crash 
therefore  twa believes that the resolution of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the company is unable to identify or predict the extent of any adverse effect on its revenues  yields or results of operations which has resulted or may result from the public perception of the crash 
on may   the bilateral air transport agreement between the us and france lapsed 
any reduction in us carrier access could have an adverse impact on twa s transatlantic operations 
absent a bilateral agreement  the us and france are operating on a system of comity and reciprocity 
under this regime  carriers are permitted to maintain historical levels of service  but few or no new services are permitted 
cessation of service to any authorized markets from france may cause such underlying authority to terminate 
in march  the president signed legislation reinstating the tax on domestic tickets  the air cargo tax and the international departure tax  effective march  these taxes had expired on december   were reinstated on august  and thereafter expired again on december  the company is not able to determine the extent to which operating results in and in early benefited from the absence of these taxes  although it does believe that such had a positive impact on its operating results 
similarly  the company believes that the reimposition of the tax in march will likely have an adverse impact on its operating results in subsequent periods 
in october congress enacted the federal aviation reauthorization act of the faa reauthorization act 
the faa reauthorization act established a national commission which  together with the dot  is to conduct an independent study of faa funding requirements and recommend alternative methods for apportioning the costs of the system to its users  including commercial airlines 
the results of the study are to be presented to the secretary of transportation in august and the secretary is to make recommendations to congress in october the company believes that the current system of a ticket tax imposed on domestic fares unfairly subsidizes certain low fare competitors 
the company and a group of other major airlines have proposed that the ticket tax be replaced by a system of user fees including an element based upon a charge per originating passenger and an element based upon a mileage charge 
the company is unable to predict the outcome of these studies or any congressional actions related thereto 
following the crash of twa flight in july  the faa implemented new security measures primarily impacting international operations 
the company does not believe that these measures have had any material effect on its revenues or operating costs to date 
additionally  a special committee appointed by the president to review aviation safety and airport security issued its final report on february  the report contains several recommendations 
however  the company is unable to predict which recommendations will be adopted or their impact on the company s future operating results 
additional government mandated security measures could have a direct adverse impact on the company s operating costs to the extent any such costs are directly assessed to commercial airlines or  if funded through new taxes or user fees  could indirectly have an adverse impact on the company s future operating results in the event that the company is not able to fully pass on those charges in the form of ticket price increases 
the company s auditors have included in their report dated march  on the consolidated financial statements an explanatory paragraph to the effect that substantial doubt exists regarding the company s ability to continue as a going concern due to the company s recurring losses from operations and limited sources of additional liquidity

these comments should be read in conjunction with  and are qualified in their entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
liquidity the company s consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was million including approximately million in cash and cash equivalents held in its international operations and by its subsidiaries which  based upon various foreign monetary regulations and other factors  might not be immediately available to the company  a million decrease from the december  balance of million 
due to seasonal factors  the company s cash balances during the first quarter of each year are typically lower than in other periods 
these seasonal factors  when combined with the large anticipated loss in the first quarter of which would significantly exceed the loss reported in the comparable quarter of  will reduce cash balances significantly below the cash balance at december  in february  in order to improve its liquidity  the company entered into an agreement with and received approximately million from certain st 
louis business enterprises  representing the advance payment for tickets for future travel by such enterprises 
the company is currently pursuing other projects intended to increase its cash balances 
in march  the company offered  units units  with each unit consisting of i one senior secured note due a note  in the principal amount of  and ii one redeemable warrant a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of approximately per share the offering 
the notes are secured by a lien on certain assets of the company  including the company s beneficial interest in its faa designated take off and landing slots at three high density  capacity controlled airports currently owned and hereafter acquired defined ground equipment of the company used at certain domestic airports  and all of the issued and outstanding stock of a a wholly owned subsidiary of twa holding the leasehold interest in a hangar at los angeles international airport and b three wholly owned subsidiaries of twa holding leasehold interests in gates and related support space at certain domestic airports served by the company 
the company realized million net of discounts and commissions and estimated expenses in proceeds from the offering 
the company intends to use a portion of the proceeds from the offering not to exceed approximately million to release certain of the collateral to be used to secure the notes from a prior existing lien and the remainder of the proceeds for general corporate purposes 
the offering was made pursuant to rule a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act  and  accordingly  the units  notes and warrants and underlying shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the federal and state securities laws 
the company has agreed to use its best efforts to file and  if declared effective  to effect  the registration of the notes and the warrants under the securities act under certain circumstances 
the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents during was due  in large part  to the fact that cash used in operating activities in was million as compared to when cash provided by operating activities was million 
the adverse change was primarily attributable to the decrease in operating income as compared with additionally  pursuant to the eight year karabu ticket program agreement between the company and karabu the karabu ticket agreement net discounted sales from tickets sold under the agreement are excluded from cash provided by operating activities as the related amounts are applied as a million reduction of the icahn loans and a million reduction of the pbgc notes 
at december  approximately million of such proceeds had been applied to the principal balance of the icahn loans  while no proceeds had been applied to the pbgc notes 
the increase of million in trade accounts payable during was primarily due to the company utilizing a safe harbor provision with regard to payment of us transportation taxes of million for the period september through december  a significant portion of which was paid in february cash used in investing activities increased million from million in to million in a large part of this increase was related to capital expenditures million in versus million in which had been somewhat restricted by fiscal controls in place during most of financing activities provided million of cash in  compared with a net use of cash of million in proceeds from long term debt and sale and leaseback transactions decreased from million in to million in repayments of long term debt and capital leases required million more cash in than in in  net proceeds from the sale of cumulative convertible exchangeable preferred stock preferred stock were million while the early redemption of the mandatorily redeemable stock and cash dividends required million and million  respectively 
in the net proceeds from an equity rights offering generated million 
as previously described  management has indicated that it is focusing on the improvement of twa s schedule reliability and on time performance and that it plans to accelerate the replacement of it s l and b fleets with b  b and md aircraft 
management believes that these  as well as other actions which it has taken or expects to take  should substantially improve twa s unit revenues and reduce its operating costs in the company believes that a substantial improvement in its operating results is necessary for twa to maintain adequate liquidity to meet its obligations throughout the remainder of the achievement of these improved operating results are subject to significant uncertainties  including the company s ability to achieve higher revenue yields and load factors  the cost of aircraft fuel  the company s ability to finance or lease suitable replacement aircraft at reasonable rates and the containment of operating costs 
in march the company completed the sale of  shares of its preferred stock for gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds to the company of approximately million  after commissions and expenses

pursuant to the reorganization  the company issued  ticket vouchers  each with a face value of  which may be used for up to discount off the cost of a twa airline ticket for transportation on twa ticket vouchers 
pursuant to certain agreements  the company repurchased approximately  of the ticket vouchers at an aggregate cost of million 
payments in respect of these ticket vouchers were approximately  in and approximately million in concurrently  the company undertook aircraft lease payment deferrals to increase liquidity and improve the company s financial condition 
gross deferrals of lease and conditional sale indebtedness payments aggregated approximately million with a weighted average repayment period of approximately two years 
the aircraft lease payment deferrals contemplated by the reorganization generally anticipated six month deferrals with various payback periods  extending in some instances over the remaining life of the lease  and in other cases over a specified period 
cash repayments of lease deferrals  including interest  were approximately million in the fourth quarter of  million in and are expected to approximate million in on june   the company signed an agreement the extension and consent agreement with karabu to extend the term of the icahn loans from january  to january   to obtain the consent of karabu and the icahn entities to certain modifications to certain promissory notes issued to the pbgc in connection with the reorganization the pbgc notes and to obtain agreement with the icahn entities to refrain from exercising the right to terminate certain pension plans  covering employees of the company as to which mr 
icahn and the icahn entities assumed certain obligations in the reorganization 
any such termination would not increase the obligations of twa under the pbgc notes or other obligations of twa to mr 
icahn  the icahn entities or the pbgc 
collateral for the icahn loans includes a number of aircraft  engines and related equipment  along with substantially all of the company s receivables 
on june   the company made a million interest payment on the icahn loans 
at december   the outstanding balance of the icahn loans was approximately million excluding approximately million in accrued and unpaid interest 
the notes evidencing the icahn loans have been pledged by mr 
icahn and certain affiliated entities as security for certain obligations of the icahn entities to the pbgc and or in respect of funding obligations on the company s pre reorganization pension plans 
on june   in consideration of  among other things  the extension of the icahn loans  twa and karabu entered into an eight year karabu ticket program agreement the ticket agreement 
there are two categories of tickets under the ticket agreement domestic consolidator tickets  which are subject to a cap of million  based on the full retail price of the tickets million in the first months and million per year for seven consecutive years through the term of the ticket agreement and system tickets  which are not subject to any cap throughout the term of the ticket agreement 
tickets sold by the company to karabu pursuant to the ticket agreement are priced at levels intended to approximate current competitive discount fares available in the airline industry 
the ticket agreement provides that no ticket may be included with an origin or destination of st 
louis  nor may any ticket include flights on other carriers 
tickets sold by karabu pursuant to the ticket agreement are required to be at fares specified in the ticket agreement  net to twa  and exclusive of tax 
no commissions will be paid by twa for tickets sold under the ticket agreement  and twa believes that under the applicable provisions of the ticket agreement  karabu may not market or sell such tickets through travel agents 
karabu  however  has been marketing tickets through travel agents 
twa has demanded that karabu cease doing so and karabu has stated that it disagrees with the company s interpretation concerning sales through travel agents 
in december  the company filed a lawsuit against karabu  mr 
icahn and affiliated companies seeking damages and to enjoin further violations 
mr 
icahn countered threatening to attempt to declare a default on the icahn loans on a variety of claims related to his various interpretations of the security documents related to such loans as well as with respect to alleged violations of the ticket agreement by the company 
a violation of the ticket agreement by the company could result in a cross default under the icahn loans 
mr 
icahn also alleged independent violations of the icahn loans  including  among other things  that the company has not been maintaining  as required by the terms of the icahn loans  certain aircraft which twa has retired from service and stored which are pledged as security for the icahn loans 
to endeavor to eliminate this issue from the various disputes with mr 
icahn  the company has deposited an amount equal to the appraised fair market value with a security trustee and requested the release of the liens on such aircraft 
to date  the trustee has not released such liens 
the parties negotiated a series of standstill agreements pursuant to which twa s original lawsuit was withdrawn  while the company and mr 
icahn endeavored to negotiate a settlement of their differences and respective claims 
those negotiations reached an impasse and the company re filed its suit on march  in the st 
louis county circuit court 
also on march   karabu and certain other companies controlled by mr 
icahn filed suit against the company alleging violations by the company of the ticket agreement and federal anti trust laws 
on march   the federal district court for the southern district of new york  on the company s motion  dismissed the suit in its entirety 
if karabu s interpretation as to sales of discount tickets to the general public through travel agents was determined by a court or otherwise to be correct and the company did not otherwise take appropriate action to mitigate the effect of such sales  the company could suffer significant loss of revenue so as to reduce overall passenger yields on a continuing basis during the term of the ticket agreement 
in addition  any default by the company under the ticket agreement or directly on the icahn loans which resulted in an acceleration of the icahn loans could result in a cross default to the company s other indebtedness and leases and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company 
domestic consolidator tickets sold under the ticket agreement are limited to certain origin destination city markets in which twa has less than a market share limit except for new york where there is a limit 
these restricted markets will be reviewed from time to time to determine any change in twa s market share  and other markets may be designated as necessary 
the purchase price for the tickets purchased by karabu are required to either  at karabu s option  be retained by karabu and the amount so retained credited as prepayments against the outstanding balance of the icahn loans  or be paid over by karabu to a settlement trust established in connection with the reorganization for twa s account as prepayments on the pbgc notes 
at december   approximately million of such proceeds had been applied to the principal balance of the icahn loans and million had been applied to the pbgc notes 
the company elected to pay interest  due august  and february   on its senior secured reset notes  in shares of common stock 
the amount of such interest aggregated approximately million and million  respectively  and resulted in the issuance of approximately million and million shares of common stock on the respective dates 
the company elected to pay dividends due february  on its preferred stock for the period from november  to and including january   in the amount of approximately million  in shares of common stock 
capital resources twa has no unused credit lines and must satisfy all of its working capital and capital expenditure requirements from cash provided by operating activities  from external borrowings or from the sale of assets 
substantially all of twa s strategic assets  including its owned aircraft  ground equipment  gates  slots and overhaul facilities  have been pledged to secure various issues of outstanding indebtedness of the company 
sales of such assets which are not replaced would  under the terms of applicable financing agreements  generally require payment of the indebtedness secured thereby  which indebtedness in many cases would likely exceed the immediately realizable value of such assets 
twa has relatively few non strategic assets which it could monetize  substantially all of such assets being subject to various liens and security interests which would restrict and or limit the ability of twa to realize any significant proceeds from the sale thereof 
to the extent that the company s access to capital is constrained  the company may not be able to make certain capital expenditures or implement certain other aspects of its strategic plan  and the company may therefore be unable to achieve the full benefits expected therefrom 
as a result of the redemption of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock  certain of twa s leasehold interests in domestic airport gates were released as collateral and are now unencumbered 
as a result of the exchange of common stock for senior secured notes as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  liens on the stock of wholly owned subsidiary which owns twa s interest in a hangar at los angeles international airport and a floating lien on certain of twa s domestic airport ground equipment were released as collateral and are also now unencumbered 
in addition  based on the current level of outstanding senior secured notes  twa expects that certain slots at new york s laguardia and jfk airports  as well as chicago s o hare airport  will be released as security for the senior secured notes 
commitments in february  twa executed definitive agreements providing for the operating lease of new b aircraft to be delivered in and with deliveries commencing in july although individual aircraft rentals escalate over the term of the leases  aggregate rental obligations are estimated to average approximately million per annum over the lease terms after all aircraft have been delivered 
these aircraft have an initial lease term of years 
as of february   the company has taken delivery of six leased b aircraft 
the company also entered into an agreement in february with boeing for the purchase of ten b aircraft and related engines  spare parts and equipment for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the agreement requires the delivery of the aircraft in  and  and provides for the purchase of up to ten additional aircraft 
furthermore  to the extent twa exercises its options for additional aircraft  the company will have the right to an equal number of additional option aircraft 
twa has obtained commitments for debt financing for approximately of the total costs associated with the acquisition of eight of the original ten aircraft and obtained commitments for lease financing of the total costs of the remaining two original aircraft 
such commitments are subject to  among other things  so called material adverse change clauses which  given the company s financial results for and anticipated results for the first quarter of  could make the availability of such debt and lease financing dependent upon the lender s and lessor s ongoing evaluation of and satisfaction with the financial condition of twa 
twa has entered into agreements with avsa  sarl and rolls royce plc relating to the purchase of ten a twin engine wide body aircraft and related engines  spare parts and equipment for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion 
the agreements  as amended  require the delivery of the aircraft in and and provide for the purchase of up to ten additional aircraft 
twa has not yet made arrangements for the permanent financing of the purchases subject to the agreements 
in the event of cancellation  predelivery payments of approximately million would be subject to forfeiture 
the company has entered into an agreement to acquire from the manufacturer fifteen new md s 
the long term leasing arrangement provides for delivery of the aircraft between the second half of and april twa has elected to comply with the transition requirements of the noise act by adopting the stage aircraft phase out retrofit option  which requires that of its base level december stage fleet be phased out retrofitted by december   by december  and by december  to comply with the requirement  the company has retrofitted  by means of engine hush kits  of its dc aircraft 
the aggregate cost of these hush kits is estimated to be million  most of which has been financed by lessors with repayments being facilitated through increased rental rates 
twa s capital expenditures for are currently anticipated to total approximately million  including approximately million for flight equipment related expenditures eg  progress payments for aircraft and the purchase of related aircraft engines and spare parts 
while the company is seeking financing for certain of its planned capital expenditures  a substantial portion of such expenditures are expected to utilize internally generated funds 
the inability to finance or otherwise fund such expenditures could materially adversely affect the ability of the company to implement its strategic plan 
certain other capital requirements expenditures for facilities and equipment  other than aircraft  generally are not committed prior to purchase and  therefore  no such significant commitments exist at the present time 
twa s ability to finance such expenditures will depend in part on twa s financial condition at the time of the commitment 
availability of nols the company estimates that it had  for federal income tax purposes  net operating loss carryforwards nols amounting to approximately million at december   which includes increases in the nols as originally filed 
such nols expire in through if not utilized before then to offset taxable income 
section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  and regulations issued thereunder  impose limitations on the ability of corporations to use nols  if the corporation experiences a more than change in ownership during certain periods 
in connection with the change of ownership caused by the reorganization  the company elected to reduce its nols in accordance with section of the code and regulations issued thereunder 
if another ownership change were to occur prior to september  the annual limitation on the company s utilization of its then existing nols would be reduced to zero 
changes in ownership in periods thereafter could substantially restrict the company s ability to utilize its tax net operating loss carryforwards 
there can be no assurance that an ownership change will not occur in the future 
in addition  the nols are subject to examination by the irs  and thus  are subject to adjustment or disallowance resulting from any such irs examination 
for financial reporting purposes  the tax benefits from tax net operating loss carryforwards arising prior to the effective date will  to the extent realized in future periods  have no impact on the company s operating results  but instead be applied to reduce reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets
