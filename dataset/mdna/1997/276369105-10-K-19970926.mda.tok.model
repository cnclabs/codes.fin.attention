introduction revenues the company is a non hazardous solid waste management company specializing in the collection  transportation  and disposal of residential  industrial  commercial  and special waste  principally in the eastern united states 
the company s revenues for the year ended june  were comprised of approximately solid waste collection and transportation operations  approximately solid waste disposal operations  and approximately other waste management services 
the company s solid waste collection operations earn revenues from fees collected from residential  commercial  and industrial collection and transfer station customers 
solid waste collection is provided under two primary types of arrangements depending on the customers being served 
collection services for commercial and industrial customers are generally performed under one to three year service agreements 
collection services for residential customers generally are performed under contracts with  or franchises granted by  municipalities or regional authorities that grant the company rights to service all or a portion of the residents in their jurisdictions  except in rural areas where the company usually contracts directly with the customer 
such contracts or franchises generally range in duration from one to three years 
recently  some municipalities have bid their residential collection contracts based on the volume of waste collected versus the number of households serviced 
residential collection fees are either paid by the municipalities out of tax revenues or service charges or paid directly by residents receiving the services 
as part of its solid waste collection operations  the company s five owned or operated transfer stations receive solid waste collected primarily by its various collection operations  compact the waste and transfer it to larger vehicles for transport to landfills 
this procedure reduces the company s costs by improving its use of collection personnel and equipment 
the company s solid waste landfills earn revenues from disposal fees charged to third parties and from disposal fees charged to the company s collection and transportation operations that dispose of solid waste at the company s landfills 
these landfills receive solid waste from the company s own collection companies and transfer stations  as well as from independent collection operators 
for the year ended june   approximately of the company s revenue generated from collection operations represented solid waste collected by the company that was delivered for disposal at its own landfills  and approximately of the company s revenue generated from landfill disposal operations represented solid waste disposed of at the company s landfills that was delivered by the company 
the company s prices for solid waste collection  transportation  and disposal services are typically determined by the volume  weight  or type of waste collected  as well as other factors including the competitive pricing environment 
the company s ability to pass on cost increases may be limited by the terms of its contracts 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of tipping fees paid to third party landfills  accruals for future landfill closure and post closure costs  direct labor and related taxes and benefits  subcontracted transportation and equipment rental charges  maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities  environmental compliance costs and site maintenance costs for landfills  fuel  and landfill assessment fees and taxes 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of management  clerical and administrative salaries and costs and overhead  professional services  facility rentals and associated costs  financial insurance bonding premiums  landfill related financial assurance bonding premiums  and costs relating to marketing and sales 
the company capitalizes direct incremental costs associated with purchase acquisitions 
indirect development and acquisition costs  such as executive salaries  corporate overhead  public relations  and other corporate services and overhead are expensed as incurred 
the company also charges as an expense any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to proposed acquisitions that will not be consummated 
at june   capitalized costs related directly to proposed acquisitions that were not yet consummated were  million 
the company periodically reviews the future realization of these capitalized project costs and makes provisions against capitalized costs that are associated with projects that are not likely to be completed 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation of buildings  vehicles  and machinery and equipment  amortization of capitalized direct landfill development costs  and amortization expense related to intangible assets including goodwill 
property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method 
intangible assets  including goodwill  are amortized over their useful lives using the straight line method 
certain direct engineering  legal  permitting  construction  and other costs associated with expansion of landfills  together with related interest costs  are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the site using the unit of production method as airspace is consumed 
successful permitting of additional landfill disposal capacity improves the company s profitability by increasing the airspace over which the company may amortize capitalized costs of the landfill 
at june   capitalized costs related directly to the acquisition and expansion of existing and future landfills and cell development were million 
the company s policy is to charge as an expense any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances relating to any landfill that is permanently closed or any landfill expansion project that is abandoned 
merger costs in connection with acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method  the company records various merger costs including transaction related expenses and costs to bring the acquired assets into conformity with corporate safety and operational standards 
other income expense other income and expense  which is composed primarily of interest income and gains and losses on sales of equipment  has not historically been material to the company s results of operations 
taxes in fiscal  the company utilized approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
at june   the company has available approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
in fiscal  the company s provision for income taxes should more closely approximate the statutory tax rates  increased by the effect of nondeductible amortization expense 
acquisition program the company has implemented an aggressive acquisition program to expand its operations by acquiring solid waste collection  transportation  and disposal businesses  principally in the eastern united states 
approximately million or of the company s revenues for the year ended june  and approximately million or of the company s assets at june  resulted from these acquisitions consummated by the company between july and june  of these acquisitions  have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and three have been accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
with respect to the acquisitions that have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  goodwill is amortized over a period of years  resulting in an annual noncash charge to earnings during the amortization period 
accordingly  if the company completes additional acquisitions which are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  its financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period  as a result of additional noncash charges relating to goodwill 
amortization expense of goodwill was approximately  for the year ended june  in addition  the company closed into escrow on may  the pending acquisitions of golden gate carting co 
inc  golden gate and coney island rubbish removal  inc coney island pending satisfaction of certain normal conditions which the company believes will be resolved 
estimated consideration relating to the golden gate and coney island acquisitions consists of  unregistered shares of the company s common stock and the assumption of approximately million of debt 
the acquisitions of golden gate and coney island will be accounted for under the purchase method 
in connection with each of its acquisitions  the company attempts to implement a number of cost saving measures  including possible reductions in management levels and other personnel  the implementation of centralized management and cost controls  and the elimination of duplicate collection routes 
because of the relative importance of acquired businesses and assets to the company s financial performance  the company does not believe that its historical financial statements are necessarily indicative of future performance 
recent developments after june   the company acquired two hauling and collection companies  a special waste company  and a landfill in separate transactions 
consideration included an aggregate of approximately  unregistered shares of common stock   cash to the sellers  and  of assumed debt 
these transactions will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
additionally  in august of  the company completed its merger with a hauling and collection company for approximately  unregistered shares of common stock 
this transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
periods prior to consummation of this acquisition will not be restated to reflect the pooling of interests as combined financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be materially different from the results as presented 
also  in two separate transactions  the company acquired equipment  real estate and permits necessary to operate a transfer station 
consideration included approximately  cash to the sellers and notes totaling  there is a contingent component to one of the transactions which could require the company to pay up to an additional  upon the receipt of an additional  final permit

a portion of the decrease was also attributable to economies of scale relating to the company s increase in size over the period 
cost of revenues increased approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal the principal factors affecting the increase in cost of revenues for the year ended june  were a charge of  for closure and post closure monitoring costs relating to the company s kentucky landfill  and and increase at super kwik due to acquisitions completed in january and november of this increase was partially offset by reduced operating costs at donno primarily due to the discontinuation of a collection services contract in new york city and the termination of a contract to operate a transfer station in hempstead  long island  and the company s discontinuance of its collection operation at the south carolina landfill 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were million compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
these expenses as a percentage of revenues for the year ended june  were compared to for the same period in fiscal this reduction as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to certain cost savings related to economies of scale in restructuring the company s insurance program and overall economies gained through elimination of redundant overhead as a result of integration of acquisitions

the company s effective tax rate  excluding the impact of s corporation status termination and income prior to the pooling dates  was for fiscal the effective tax rate was less than the federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the reversal of the valuation allowance 
the company s effective tax rate  including both federal and state taxes  was for fiscal with a minimal tax benefit being recorded in in  the company s effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory rates primarily due to income generated from super kwik and donno which were taxed under subchapter s of the internal revenue code

as of september   approximately million in letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility 
also  at september   there were no borrowings under the credit facility as a result of the net proceeds of the recently completed public offering being used to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility

the company estimates aggregate capital expenditures  exclusive of acquisitions of businesses  of approximately million for the year ending june  the company has addressed its capital needs through private and public offerings of common stock and by establishing a revolving credit facility 
the company believes that the revolving credit facility  the funds expected to be generated from operations  the net proceeds of the recently completed public offering and possible future equity offerings will provide adequate cash to fund the company s working capital and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
the company has financial obligations related to closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance of the currently permitted and operating landfills 
while the exact amount of future closure and post closure obligations cannot be determined  the company estimates that the costs of final closure of the currently permitted and operating areas at the company s landfills will be approximately million  of which million has been accrued as of june  the company makes an accrual for these costs based on consumed airspace in relation to management s estimate of total available airspace of the landfills 
in addition  the company has accrued million for post closure obligations as of june  the company maintains a bonding facility pursuant to certain statutory requirements regarding financial assurance for the closure and post closure monitoring cost requirements for its kentucky  west virginia and pennsylvania disposal facilities 
bonds outstanding at june  were million for the kentucky landfill   for the west virginia landfill  and million for the pennsylvania landfill 
the bonds are collateralized by irrevocable letters of credit and trust fund deposits 
additionally  the company has on deposit  as financial assurance for landfill closure and post closure obligations for closed disposal areas 
the trust fund and the certificates of deposit are restricted from current operations and are included within other noncurrent assets 
the company s kentucky landfill bonding requirement will increase by million for closure and  for post closure of the expansion area permitted october  reissued february  
the company anticipates that the west virginia bonding requirements will substantially increase when west virginia s solid waste program is approved by the federal government 
financial assurance requirements could increase to approximately million for closure and million for post closure monitoring and care 
in connection with the illinois landfill  which the company has exercised an option to acquire  the company has agreed to indemnify a surety providing financial assurance for closure and post closure care requirements for an unlined landfill located adjacent to the illinois landfill in the amount of  in the event the owner of the adjacent landfill defaults on its closure and or post closure care obligations 
additional collateral requirements may be imposed upon the company as a result of additional landfill acquisitions or changes in current regulations which may adversely effect its profitability 
the company anticipates providing financial assurance incrementally  as permitted by regulations  over the life of a facility as disposal cells are constructed and certified for acceptance of waste 
seasonality and inflation the company s revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the spring and summer months 
this is primarily attributable to the fact that i the volume of waste relating to construction and demolition activities tends to increase in the spring and summer months and ii the volume of industrial and residential waste in the regions in which the company operates tends to decrease during the winter months 
in addition  particularly harsh weather conditions may affect the company s operations by interfering with collection  transportation  and disposal operations  delaying the development of landfill capacity  and or reducing the volume of waste generated by the company s customers 
the company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had  and are not expected to have  any material adverse effect on its results of operations in the near future
