overview the predecessor companies of the oncology group and of equimed commenced operation in february as of december   the oncology group owned or operated a total of radiation oncology centers located in arizona  florida  illinois  maryland  new jersey  new york  north carolina  ohio and pennsylvania 
the oncology group also managed four radiation oncology centers in maryland  new jersey  new york and pennsylvania and planned to open an additional center in massachusetts 
the oncology group was formed for the purpose of effecting the merger and  immediately prior to consummation of the merger  acquired all of the stock or assets of various corporations and certain partnership interests which owned or controlled radiation oncology centers 
in addition  the oncology group entered into management agreements with the affiliated medical practices associated with such centers 
see item business company history 
the management agreements are for an initial year term and provide for successive automatic renewals 
while equimed can terminate the management agreements without cause  the affiliated medical practices can terminate the management agreements only in the event of non payment by equimed of certain obligations of the affiliated medical practices 
equimed has the unilateral right to not extend the renewal provisions of the management agreements 
because of the provisions of the management agreements  the company currently records all revenue  expenses and results of operations of the affiliated medical practices in its financial statements 
dr 
colkitt has granted to the company  or its designee  an irrevocable option to acquire for a nominal amount the common stock of each of the affiliated medical practices that he owns 
the exercise periods of these option agreements coincide with the duration of the related management agreements 
equimed and its predecessor companies have grown principally through the development of new oncology centers either alone or jointly with other entities such as hospitals 
such development is based on equimed s internal assessment of market feasibility  design and construction of centers  physician and staff recruitment and acquisition of equipment 
in addition  equimed acquired existing radiation oncology centers in tampa  florida  brooklyn  new york  salisbury  north carolina and southampton  pennsylvania and expects that this strategy will become a more significant factor in generating future growth 
more recently  the company has become a holding company for a variety of entities providing a range of information technology  transcription and outsourcing services 
the table below indicates  as of the dates noted  the number of oncology centers operated by equimed and its predecessor companies and full time oncologists contracting with or employed by affiliated medical practices associated with such centers with which the company has management agreements 
in  the company acquired interests in one oncology center and entered into management agreements with two complementary subspecialty medical practices in urology and internal medicine 
q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q oncologists oncology centers a substantial portion of equimed s revenue is derived from government health care reimbursement programs  commercial insurance carriers and other third party payors  all of which payors have instituted cost containment measures designed to limit payments made to health care providers such as equimed 
continued cost containment efforts by private and government insurers may have a material adverse effect on equimed 
for example  the recently implemented medicare rbrvs payment system has reduced medicare reimbursement rates for certain of the procedures performed at the oncology centers and affiliated medical practices 
future implementation of such a system with respect to third party payors  which has been advocated  would adversely affect equimed s operating margins to the extent that the cost of providing medical services could not be concomitantly reduced
