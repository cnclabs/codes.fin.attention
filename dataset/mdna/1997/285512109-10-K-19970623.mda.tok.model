management believes these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and its current estimate of potential returns and allowances 
during fiscal the company invested approximately  primarily in computer hardware and software purchases required to support the company s development efforts and new management information systems worldwide 
in connection with the company s purchases of sony products to be distributed in japan  sony of japan requires cash deposits totaling one third of purchase orders 
additionally  nintendo of japan requires cash deposits on all orders of n cartridge products 
eav utilizes lines of credit to fund these deposits for purchases of sony and nintendo products and for other operating requirements 
at march   eav had approximately  outstanding on this line 
the company s principal source of liquidity is  in cash and short term investments 
management believes the existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and investment requirements for the foreseeable future 
factors affecting future performance future operating results of the company depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties 
some of those important risks and uncertainties which may cause the company s operating results to vary or which may materially and adversely affect ea s operating results are as follows the industry and competition 
the interactive software business has historically been a volatile and highly dynamic industry affected by changing technology  limited hardware platform life cycles  hit products  competition  component supplies  seasonality  consumer spending and other economic trends 
the business is also intensely competitive 
a variety of companies offer products that compete directly with one or more of the company s products 
these direct competitors vary in size from very small companies to companies with financial  managerial and technical resources comparable to or greater than those of the company 
typically  the company s chief competitor on dedicated game platforms is the hardware manufacturer licensor itself  to which the company must pay royalties  and in the case of sony and nintendo  manufacturing charges 
for example  sony has aggressively launched sports product lines that directly compete with the company s sports products on the playstation 
in addition  competition for creative talent has intensified  and the attraction and retention of key personnel by the company is increasingly difficult 
products 
interactive entertainment software products typically have life spans of only to months 
in addition  the market is crowded with a large number of titles competing for limited shelf space at retail 
the company s future success will depend in large part on its ability to develop and introduce new competitive products on a timely basis and to get those products distributed widely at retail 
to compete successfully  new products must adapt to new hardware platforms and emerging industry standards  provide additional functionality and be successfully distributed in numerous changing worldwide markets 
if the company were unable  due to resource constraints or technological or other reasons  to successfully develop and distribute such products in a timely manner  this inability would have a material adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition 
development 
product development schedules  particularly for new hardware platforms and high end multimedia pcs are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes  use of new development tools for new platforms and the learning process  research and experimentation associated with development for new technologies 
cd rom products frequently include more content and are more complex  time consuming and costly to develop than bit cartridge products and  accordingly  cause additional development and scheduling risk 
for example  in fiscal year madden football and nhl hockey for the playstation did not ship at all due to significant delays in development that made the delayed completion date untimely for these products 
likewise  need for speed ii for pc cd  a high margin product scheduled for shipment in march of  did not ship until april of due to last minute development delays 
dungeon keeper  originally scheduled to ship in the quarter ended june  is now expected to ship during the summer of in addition  development risks for cd rom products can cause particular difficulties in predicting quarterly results because brief manufacturing lead times allow finalizing products and projected release dates late in a quarter 
manufacturing lead times during the year for cd based products have been as brief as one to three weeks  cartridge products more typically have had a six to twelve week lead time for manufacture 
platform changes 
a large portion of the company s revenues are derived from the sale of products designed to be played on proprietary video game platforms such as the playstation  sega saturn  super nintendo entertainment system  sega genesis and the n the interdependent nature of the company s business and that of its hardware licensors brings significant risks to the company s business 
the success of the company s products is significantly affected by market acceptance of the new video game hardware systems and the life span of older hardware platforms  and the company s ability to accurately predict these factors with respect to each platform 
in many cases  the company will have expended a large amount of development and marketing resources on products designed for new video game systems such as the new bit systems that have not yet achieved large installed bases or will have continued product development for older hardware platforms that may have shorter life cycles than the company expected 
conversely  if the company does not choose to develop for a platform that achieves significant market acceptance  or discontinues development for a platform that has a longer life cycle than expected  the company s revenue growth may be adversely affected 
for example  the company signed an agreement with nintendo to develop and publish a line of ea sports products for the n in march of  nearly seven months after introduction of that platform in north america 
due to long development times associated with this platform  the company will not ship n products in significant quantities until calendar year the company believes that investment in products for the bit market  including both pc cd and cd video game platforms particularly the playstation has been strategically important in positioning the company for the now completed transition to bit machines 
the company continues to believe that such investment is important and will continue its aggressive development activities for bit platforms 
although the playstation has achieved significant market acceptance in all geographic territories  there can be no assurance that its growth will continue at the present rates  particularly with the introduction of the n by nintendo 
the introduction and market acceptance of the n  particularly in north america  may adversely affect the growth rate of the bit cd platforms 
while the company has a broad range of products available and under development for the playstation and for pc cd  the company will not ship products for the n in any significant quantities until calendar year hardware companies 
the company s contracts with hardware licensors  which are also some of the company s chief competitors  often grant significant control to the licensor over the manufacturing of the company s products 
this fact could  in certain circumstances  leave the company unable to get its products manufactured and shipped to customers 
in most events  control of the manufacturing process by hardware companies increases both the manufacturing lead times and the expense to the company as compared to the lead times and costs that the company can achieve independently 
in both fiscal and fiscal  for example  the company experienced delays in the manufacturing of playstation products which caused delays in shipping those products 
the results of future periods may be affected by similar delays 
finally  the company s contracts with its hardware licensors often require the company to take significant risks in holding or prepaying for its inventory of products 
in particular  the company s agreement with nintendo for n products requires prepayment of costly cartridge based inventory  minimum orders and no rights of return 
revenue and expenses 
a substantial majority of the revenue of the company in any quarter typically results from orders received in that quarter and products introduced in that quarter 
the company s expenses are based  in part  on development of products to be released in the future 
certain overhead and product development expenses do not vary directly in relation to revenues 
this trend is increasing as the company increases the proportion of products developed internally 
as a result  the company s quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict  and small delays in product deliveries may cause quarterly revenues  operating results and net income to fall significantly below anticipated levels 
the company typically receives orders shortly before shipments  making backlog an unreliable indicator of quarterly results 
a shortfall in shipments at the end of any particular quarter may cause the results of that quarter to fall significantly short of anticipated levels 
film and videotape 
the company produces film and videotape to include in certain products pursuant to agreements between certain of the company s subsidiaries with sag  aftra and equity 
however  the costs of video production are significantly higher than for software production  and for products which include a substantial amount of video such as certain interactive movies  the costs of producing the video component is significantly higher than the cost of developing the software component 
accordingly  more units of such products must be sold to recoup the development and production costs 
there can be no assurance that these products which include significant film or videotape components will be commercially successful enough to recoup development costs 
in addition  the company s agreements with sag and aftra expire during the current calendar year  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to renegotiate favorable terms 
gross margins 
although gross margins for the company s products as a whole have increased over the last three fiscal years  there are no assurances that this trend will continue in the future for several reasons 
professional and celebrity royalties continue to increase 
also  while the costs of development of new products for and bit systems have increased  overall costs of goods are not declining 
for products on platforms for which the company is required to purchase its goods from the hardware companies  the company is unable to achieve cost reductions through manufacturing efficiencies  and royalties to hardware companies remain fixed or are increasing 
as the company begins to ship n products in significant quantities  margins may further decline due to the higher cost of goods associated with this cartridge based platform 
similarly  higher distribution expenses for operations in europe and north america and growth of the lower margin distribution business continue to put pressure on margins 
in addition  retailers continue to require significant price protection for products  and with an increasing number of titles available for advanced platforms  such requirements for price protection may increase 
marketing and distribution 
both the video game and pc businesses have become increasingly hits driven 
additional marketing and advertising funds are required to drive and support hit products  particularly television advertising 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to produce hit titles  or that advertising for any product will increase sales sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses 
employees 
competition for employees in the interactive software business is intense and increasing as competition in the industry increases 
in the last fiscal year  recruiting of the company s employees generally  and its executive officers in particular  has been intense 
large software and media companies frequently offer significantly larger cash compensation than does the company  placing pressure on the company s base salary and cash bonus compensation 
small start up companies such as those proliferating in the online business areas offer significant potential equity gains which are difficult for more mature companies like the company to match without significant stockholder dilution 
while executive turnover has decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  virtually all of the executives continue to experience intense recruiting pressure 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain enough qualified employees in the future 
foreign sales and currency fluctuations 
for the fiscal year  international net revenues comprised of total consolidated net revenues 
the company expects foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and growing portion of the company s revenues 
such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers 
additionally  foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate 
investments in affiliates 
the company has a number of equity investments in affiliates  including small developers  such as firaxis and visual concepts  other publishers  such as novalogic  inc and accolade  inc  and new ventures such as mpath interactive 
these companies are generally small and without significant financial resources 
financial difficulties for any of these companies could cause a reduction in the value of the company s investment 
for example  in fiscal the company wrote off its investment in sportslab in its entirety 
fluctuations in stock price 
due to analysts expectations of continued growth and other factors  any shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
as a result of the factors discussed in this annual report and other factors that may arise in the future  the market price of the company s common stock historically has been  and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations over a short period of time 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors affecting the computer  software  entertainment  media or electronics industries or the securities markets in general 
for example  during the fiscal years and the price per share of the company s common stock ranged from to and from to  respectively 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results and financial condition  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods
