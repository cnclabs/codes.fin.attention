item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general hugoton energy corporation was formed in through the acquisition of several limited partnership interests in the hugoton producing area  and until grew primarily through acquisitions in that core area 
since  the company has grown through producing property and leasehold acquisitions and development and exploratory drilling  primarily in three additional core areas the williston basin  the permian basin and  most recently  the austin chalk trend 
expansion into these areas marked a shift in the company s asset base from the lower risk  limited upside of the hugoton producing area to areas with much greater exploration and development potential 
on february   the company completed its initial public offering of million shares of common stock 
the company s capital budget is million  an increase of over capital expenditures  and of the drilling budget is planned for expenditures outside of the hugoton producing area 
the company continues to aggressively pursue acquisitions  but the timing and impact of such acquisitions cannot be predicted 
acquisitions and property sales 
during  the company spent million to acquire  additional net undeveloped acres  including  net acres in the williston basin 
these acreage additions were equal to of the company s net undeveloped acres at december  on june   the company purchased a working interest for million in approximately  gross acres in the austin chalk trend in louisiana 
this acreage acquisition  coupled with the january  acreage acquisition mentioned below and several smaller acreage acquisitions in the third quarter  presents the company with a total of  gross acres in the austin chalk trend to explore 
during  the company sold its interest in a group of non strategic producing gas properties and a gas gathering and salt water disposal system located in southern colorado and northern new mexico to a major oil company for million 
the company also sold its interest in approximately non strategic producing oil properties located in northeast oklahoma for million 
on january   the company purchased an undivided interest in a group of producing oil and gas properties and undeveloped acreage for million from a privately held company that owns an undivided interest in and operates the properties 
the producing properties and acreage are located in southeast texas and established a presence for the company in the austin chalk trend 
the acquisition included eight producing wells and  gross acres  in which the company s working interests are and  respectively 
prior major property acquisitions 
the company s current property position has been shaped by two large acquisitions consummated in and and several smaller acquisitions 
in september  the company acquired cog  a privately owned oil and gas company for million in cash and million shares of common stock 
the acquisition extended the company s operations into several basins outside the hugoton producing area  primarily into the williston basin and permian basin 
in july  the company significantly strengthened its position as a major operator in the hugoton field with the million purchase from prudential of interests in two limited partnerships formed to acquire and develop properties in the hugoton producing area for which the company had acted as general partner 
these two acquisitions were supplemented by a million acquisition of producing wells in the hugoton producing area from mobil corporation in  as well as the purchase in of a interest in  mineral acres covering deep rights underlying shallow production located in the hugoton field which is being developed jointly with oxy usa the future results of the company may depend on its ability to locate and develop additional oil and natural gas properties  to attract and employ new sources of capital  to develop these properties and to successfully market the resulting production of crude oil and natural gas products 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future but it is impossible to predict these future price movements 
declines in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the company s cash flow  liquidity and profitability 
due to the nature of the oil and natural gas industry and the general risks relating to the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas  including the volatility of prices for crude oil and natural gas products  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful

for  the company recorded a tax benefit of million compared to a 
million benefit recorded in the benefit recorded in recognized the effect of the cog acquisition  whereby the company accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting  and as required by fas  the basis differences between the allocated fair value for book purposes and the assumed historical tax bases required the company to establish the necessary deferred tax liabilities for these temporary differences 
as such  the company s deferred net tax liability position allowed the company to recognize a tax benefit for the pre tax operating losses generated in the period subsequent to the acquisition date of cog 
during  the pre tax losses incurred by the company prior to the acquisition of cog were not tax benefited because the company was in a net deferred tax asset position which required such benefits to be reduced by valuation allowances 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital position increased by million from year end to million at december  cash decreased by million and accounts receivable increased by million 
the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  and to at december  capital expenditures 
the company s primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties  payment of interest on outstanding indebtedness and working capital obligations 
the company s capital expenditure budget has been set at million of which approximately million is committed to drilling  million for d seismic and land costs and million for small strategic acquisitions 
funding for the company s exploration and development activities and its working capital obligations is provided primarily by internally generated cash flow 
the company budgets its capital expenditures based on projected cash flows and routinely adjusts the level of its capital expenditures in response to anticipated changes in cash flows 
capital resources 
the company s capital resources consist of cash flow from operating activities and funds available under the credit facility 
on september   the company arranged a new bank credit facility  simultaneously with the closing of the cog acquisition 
the new facility is an unsecured million revolving credit agreement that is due september  the facility is provided by seven banks  led by bank one  texas as agent and texas commerce bank national association as co agent 
the borrowing base  as defined in the loan agreement  is currently set at million  and is subject to semi annual redetermination based upon an evaluation of the company s oil and gas reserves 
outstanding borrowings were million at december  the credit facility provides the option of borrowing at floating interest rates based on bank one s base rate or at a eurodollar option based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus of to per annum  depending on the outstanding loan balance 
interest is paid quarterly or at the end of each interest period 
the company also incurs a commitment fee of of on the unused portion of the borrowing base 
in addition  the credit facility also contains customary restrictive covenants  including restrictions on the payment of dividends in excess of of the company s annual net income  and requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
at december   the company was a party to one interest rate swap agreement that was entered into on december  for million in notional principal amount 
the effect of this agreement is to provide the company with an interest rate on million in notional principal amount for the three year term of the agreement of plus a margin of of to 
under market conditions at december   the aggregate effective annual interest rate after giving effect to the swap agreement was 
the company has historically funded its operations and capital spending programs with cash flow from operations and borrowings under bank credit facilities 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and the borrowing availability under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet its anticipated capital requirements for however  because future cash flows and the availability of financing are subject to a number of variables  such as the level of production and the prices received for oil and natural gas  there can be no assurance that the company s capital resources will be sufficient to maintain currently planned levels of capital expenditures 
hedging transactions 
with the objective of achieving more predictable revenues and cash flows and reducing the exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices  the company has entered into hedging transactions of various kinds with respect to both oil and natural gas 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
at december   the company had entered into swap agreements fixing the price of  barrels per month  for the first three months of its oil production for at a weighted average price of per bbl 
in addition  the company has entered into a forward sale of mmcf of natural gas per day for the first three months of at a net price to the company of per mcf 
the company continues to evaluate whether to enter into additional hedging transactions for and future years 
in addition  the company may determine from time to time to terminate its then existing hedging positions 
see note of the company s notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s net income  cash flows and average sales prices for were all significantly impacted by the company s oil and natural gas swap contracts  resulting in pre tax income and the average sales price per mcfe being reduced by million and  respectively  for the year ended december  the reduction was caused in part by an unusually high volatility of natural gas prices and the widening of the differential or correlation between the cash prices for the company s production and the nymex contract settlement prices 
inflation and changes in prices the company s revenues and the value of its oil and natural gas properties have and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices 
the company s ability to maintain current borrowing capacity and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is also substantially dependent on oil and natural gas prices 
oil and natural gas prices are subject to significant seasonal and other fluctuations that are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
although certain of the company s costs and expenses are affected by the level of inflation  inflation did not have a significant effect on the company s operations during or
