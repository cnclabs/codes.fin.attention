mortgage investment income decreased for as compared to primarily due to the assignment to hud of the mortgage on el lago apartments in june also contributing to the decrease was the conversion of construction loans to permanent loans at lower effective interest rates during interest and other income decreased for as compared to primarily due to a reduction in funds available for short term investment during during the first quarter of  the partnership had a greater amount of short term investments  resulting from the temporary investment of disposition proceeds received in late  prior to the distribution of these funds to partners during the first quarter of additionally  during the second quarter of  the notes receivable from affiliates were paid off as a result of the prepayment of the mortgage on richardson road apartments and the proceeds were invested in the short term money market prior to the distribution of these proceeds to partners during the third quarter of asset management fee to related parties decreased for as compared to as a result of the reduction in the mortgage base during and general and administrative expenses decreased for as compared to primarily due to a decrease in investor services expenses and annual and quarterly reporting expenses resulting from a reduction in the number of registered holders

liquidity and capital resources the partnership s operating cash receipts  derived from payments of principal and interest on insured mortgages  plus cash receipts from interest on short term investments  were sufficient during to meet operating requirements 
the basis for paying distributions to unitholders is net proceeds from mortgage dispositions  if any  and cash flow from operations  which includes regular interest income and principal from insured mortgages 
although the insured mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each quarter due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market where the monthly mortgage payment receipts are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base resulting from monthly mortgage payment receipts or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages and professional fees and foreclosure costs incurred in connection with those insured mortgages and variations in the partnership s operating expenses
