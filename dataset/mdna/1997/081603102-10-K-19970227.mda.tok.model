item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview benchmarq was incorporated in and is engaged in the design  development and marketing of mixed signal integrated circuits and electronic modules for portable and power sensitive electronic systems 
the company introduced its first products in october  and made its first shipments  principally of nvsram modules  in december in august  the company shipped its initial battery management product and in december shipped its first rtc product 
benchmarq currently is directing the majority of its research and development expenditures to the development of battery management products 
the company believes that its revenues from rtc products and nvsram products will not increase materially over the long term and may decline 
accordingly  the company expects that favorable future operating results will be substantially dependent upon its ability to expand sales of battery management products 
the company experienced significant sales of battery management products in and believes that battery management market opportunities will grow over time 
however  much of this anticipated growth is expected to result from certain technological advances currently underway in the personal computer market 
as a result  the company s most significant challenge is the timely introduction of its next generation of gas gauge products that are compatible with and take advantage of these technological advances 
although the company s management is optimistic about the prospects for its next generation of gas gauge products  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully develop and market these new products 
due in large part to competitive pressures  the company s average selling prices for its products generally have declined over time  often significantly 
these trends have had a particularly significant impact on rtc products and nvsram products and the company expects that average selling prices for these products will continue to decline in the future 
the company s ability to maintain or increase revenues will be highly dependent on the company s ability to increase unit volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new battery management products and other products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in average selling prices 
a significant portion of the company s product costs are controlled by vendors 
consequently  the company generally has not been able to reduce costs to the extent necessary to offset generally lower product selling prices 
in  however  certain product costs benefited from market conditions that lead to lower prices from vendors 
although these favorable market conditions are likely to continue into  changes could occur in the future that result in higher vendor prices 
the company s principal means of maintaining or increasing gross margins in the future is the continued successful introduction of new battery management products 
if the company is not able to do so  the company s business  financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
the company s customers generally specify short delivery times when placing their product orders 
as a result  backlog at the beginning of a quarter generally is not representative of the product sales that are anticipated for that quarter 
accordingly  a shortfall in sales in any quarter in comparison to expectations may not be identifiable until late in the quarter 
notwithstanding the difficulty of forecasting future sales  the company generally must plan production  order wafers and components  undertake sales and marketing and general and administrative activities and make other commitments months in advance of the receipt of orders 
as a result  the adverse impact of any shortfall in orders  and the consequent reduction in revenues  could be magnified by the inability to reduce operating expenses on a timely basis 
due to the foregoing  it is possible that the company s operating results in the future may from time to time be below the expectations of analysts and investors 
in such event  the market price of the company s common stock could be adversely affected 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  net revenues cost of sales gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net

net income the following tables set forth the amount and percentage of total net revenues by type of product for the periods indicated years ended december  in thousands battery management products    nvsram products    rtc products    rtc royalties other   total net revenues    years ended december  battery management products nvsram products rtc products rtc royalties other total net revenues years ended december   and net revenues 
total net revenues increased  to approximately million  for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased unit sales of gas gauge integrated circuits ic into the portable pc market  and to a lesser extent increased sales of fast charge controller ic devices into cellular  consumer  power tool and portable computer applications  increased sales of high density nvsram modules into the networking telecom markets  and increased sales of rtc ic devices into the pc market 
battery management product revenues represented approximately of total revenues in  compared to approximately in revenues from the sale of gas gauge ics represented a majority of battery management revenues in and a majority of total revenue growth from revenue generated from rtc royalties and other miscellaneous sources  which consist of design service fees  nonrecurring engineering payments  miscellaneous product sales and certain allowances for doubtful accounts  represented of total revenue in  compared with in this reduction is due principally to the fourth quarter termination of a third party design contract and significantly lower third party shipments of products that incorporate the company s rtc technology under license agreement 
the increase in total net revenues in to approximately million as compared to total net revenues of approximately million was due primarily to increased unit shipments of battery management products  rtc products and higher density nvsram products 
these increases in unit sales offset reduced unit shipments of lower density nvsram products and general decreases in average selling prices for most products 
the company s revenues from international customers accounted for approximately million  or of total net revenues  for the year ended december   approximately million  or of total net revenues  for the comparable period in  and approximately million  or of total net revenues  in in  approximately of the company s total net revenues were derived from customers in the asia pacific region 
the company s distributor in taiwan accounted for approximately million  or  of total net revenues in no other customer directly accounted for greater than of the total net revenues 
export sales are subject to a variety of risks  including those arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs  import restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences and export license requirements 
because the company s international sales have to date been denominated in us dollars  increases in the value of the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of the company s products in foreign markets and make the company s products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies 
gross margin 
the company s gross margin represented and of total net revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margin increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for as compared to million in this increase in gross margin and gross margin percentage was due primarily to an increase in unit sales of higher margin battery management products and  to a lesser extent  higher density nvsram products  which more than offset a decline in rtc royalties and the fourth quarter termination of a third party design contract 
excluding the impact of royalties and design fees  the gross margin percentage would have been approximately and in and  respectively 
as compared to  gross margin also benefited from certain lower product costs 
the company expects that gross margin in future periods will be adversely affected by declines in average selling prices  particularly with respect to its rtc products and nvsram products 
if worldwide semiconductor production capacities tighten in future periods  the company may experience increases in certain vendor prices 
to maintain or increase its gross margin over the long term  the company believes that it will be required to increase the percentage of its sales represented by battery management products and achieve cost reductions in its products generally 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve any of these objectives 
gross margin increased approximately million  or  from million in  to approximately million in  primarily due to an increase in unit sales of higher margin battery management products and  to a lesser extent  higher density nvsram products  all of which offset the negative impact of generally lower average selling prices 
research and development 
the company s research and development expenses increased approximately to million in as compared to approximately million in the increase was due primarily to increased compensation and mask tooling expenses 
as a percentage of total net revenues  research and development expense decreased slightly to approximately in as compared to in the company s research and development expenses for were approximately million  representing approximately of total net revenues 
the increase in research and development expense in compared with was due primarily to the addition of engineering personnel primarily for battery management products and increased compensation and mask tooling expenses 
the company intends to continue to make a significant investment in research and development  particularly with respect to battery management product opportunities  and believes that research and development expenses will therefore increase in absolute dollars 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased approximately million to million in as compared to this increase was due primarily to increases in compensation  sales commissions  depreciation  legal  and other general expenses 
much of the increase in legal expenses was due to a declaratory judgment proceeding brought by the company against dallas semiconductor in which the company sought a ruling that the company s products did not infringe upon certain patents held by dallas semiconductor 
although such legal proceedings were dismissed by the court in june  the company has  again  filed a declaratory judgment action against dallas semiconductor to resolve the allegations of patent infringement asserted against the company by dallas semiconductor 
since the filing of the suit by the company  dallas semiconductor has filed a lawsuit against the company alleging infringement of some of the same patents at issue in the company s declaratory judgment proceeding 
see item legal proceedings of this form k 
selling  general and administrative expense represented approximately of total net revenues in and the expense increase of approximately  in as compared with was due primarily to increases in compensation  sales commissions  advertising and legal expenses and operating expenses related to sales support in the asia pacific region and the midwest area of the united states 
although significant growth in total net revenues has in recent periods resulted in essentially flat selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of total net revenues  the absolute amount of such expense is expected to continue to increase as the company expands its product lines and geographic infrastructure 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of interest earned on short term investments of funds  net of interest expense on capital lease obligations and a million note payable in for  the company realized net other income of approximately  as compared to net other income of approximately  in and net other expense of approximately  in this improvement was due primarily to higher average balances of invested funds and the retirement of the million subordinated note payable in december proceeds from the company s initial public offering in december contributed significantly to the increase in funds available for investment 
provision for income taxes 
the company generated both book and taxable income during  and  which was substantially offset by net operating loss carryforwards from prior operating periods 
during  the company also recognized a deferred income tax asset of approximately  the realization of the net deferred tax assets in resulted from the reversal of a valuation allowance based on management s assessment that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized based on carryback potential  existing taxable temporary differences  and expectations of future income levels 
the provision for income taxes in consisted primarily of federal and state income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in and consisted primarily of alternative minimum tax and state income tax 
at december   the company had net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  and  respectively 
additionally  the company has a minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately  if not previously utilized  these carryforwards will expire at various times in the years through utilization of all net operating loss and approximately  of research and development credit carryforwards are restricted because of a change in ownership  as defined by the tax reform act of  which occurred in february see note of notes to financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal capital needs are to finance accounts receivable  inventories and additions of capital assets 
prior to its initial public offering  completed in december  the company financed its operations primarily through the private issuance of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  debt financing and lease lines of credit 
approximately million of cash was generated by operating activities in this million improvement from was due primarily to a million increase in net income in the company generated approximately million of cash from operating activities in this million improvement from was due primarily to a million increase in net income and no growth in net accounts receivable in net cash used in investing activities of approximately million during was attributable primarily to the investment of much of the company s cash equivalents into short term investments with higher expected yields 
in addition  million was used to prepay certain quantities of wafers pursuant to the option agreement under which tsmc is committed to supply and the company is committed to purchase wafers 
finally  approximately million was used for capital expenditures consisting primarily of assembly and test capacity expansion 
comparatively  net cash used in investing activities during and amounted to approximately million and  respectively  and consisted of capital expenditures 
financing activities have consisted primarily of the issuance of equity and payments under capital lease obligations 
financing activities used cash during of approximately  which consisted of proceeds of approximately  from issuances of stock and payments of approximately million under capital lease obligations 
in  financing activities generated cash of million and consisted primarily of the company s initial public offering  which provided cash of million net of costs  and the retirement of the million subordinated note payable 
financing activities used net cash of approximately  in  primarily due to payments under capital lease obligations 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations as well as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million at december  the company s short term investments are primarily in government debt securities and corporate debt securities 
in addition  the company has a lease line of credit with bancboston leasing  inc during  the company used approximately million of credit under its outstanding lease line primarily for additions of assembly and test equipment 
as of january   approximately million was available under the lease line for additional acquisitions of equipment 
the company anticipates capital asset additions to range between million and million in  a large part of which will be used to expand test capacity for certain of its battery management products  a portion of which may be financed under the company s lease line 
in connection with the option agreement with tsmc  the company issued a promissory note for  that is due on march  the company believes that existing cash balances and other capital resources will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements at least through however  the company may also seek to establish additional lines of credit to augment its funding of operating activities during there can be no assurance that the company will be able to establish any such lines of credit 
in addition  the company may  from time to time  as market and business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies 
the company  over the longer term  may seek additional equity or debt financings to fund such activities 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to the company s stockholders 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had and is not likely to have a material impact on the company s operations during the foreseeable future
