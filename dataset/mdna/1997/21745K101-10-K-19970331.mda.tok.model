for the year ended december  the company reported a net loss of million versus net income of million for the same period in net income for the year restated to exclude recall and other litigation related items would have been million or per share 
the unusual and significant expenses incurred during relating to the settlement and defense of various litigations  the company s increased insurance premiums  the decision not to reintroduce albuterol  and the underutilization of the company s new manufacturing facility were the primary causes of the decrease in profitability 
risk factors and future trends the company s future results of operations depend on its ability to obtain fda approval of andas for its new products  its ability to procure a continuous supply of raw materials  to validate its manufacturing processes used to produce consistent test batches for fda approval and to receive continued customer acceptance of its products 
raw materials are generally available from several sources  however  this may not always be the case 
since the federal drug application process requires specification of raw material suppliers  if raw materials from specified suppliers become unavailable  the company would be required to file a supplement to its product filing and revalidate the manufacturing process using a new supplier s materials 
this could cause a delay of several months in the manufacture of the drug involved and the consequent loss of potential revenue and market share 
additionally  there is often a time lag  sometimes significant  between the receipt of anda approval and the actual marketing of the approved product due to this validation process 
with the establishment of a specialized technical and validation services group in the latter part of  the company has substantially improved its validation process 
the company s future results of operations also may be affected by a variety of additional factors consistent with the nature of its business  including  but not limited to  changes in the intensity of competition affecting the company s products and customers 
multi source products with limited competition are generally sold at higher prices  resulting in relatively high gross margins 
as competition increases  selling prices and gross margins can decline dramatically and impair overall profitability 
the company is witnessing brand name competitors bundling the sale of generic and patented products as well as introducing generic versions of their own branded products prior to the expiration of the patents for such drugs  which is resulting in an increasing market share for these brand name competitors 
the company also has witnessed a consolidation of its customers  as chain drug stores and wholesalers merge or consolidate 
additionally  a number of the company s customers have instituted source programs which limit the number of suppliers of generic pharmaceutical products 
management expects these trends and the resultant price erosion to continue throughout the company will need to provide a continuous stream of new products and maintain its strong customer relations to offset these competitive pressures 
the company s gross margin continues to be depressed by the underutilization of its manufacturing facility 
during  the company increased its volume of manufactured products  however  significant increases are still needed to absorb the substantial overhead 
the company  through its restructuring of operations undertaken in the fourth quarter of  consolidated some of its facilities in an attempt to streamline its operations and reduce its overhead 
it is anticipated that the company s gross margin will continue to be depressed by the underutilization of its manufacturing facility during and until such time as the volume of manufactured products increases significantly 
continuing compliance with fda cgmp standards and applicable environmental regulations will also affect the company s future results of operations 
significant investments which increase the company s overhead need to be made from time to time to maintain the required infrastructure to comply with the fda cgmp standards 
the company has announced that it retained oppenheimer co 
to evaluate strategic alternatives including possible business alliances 
pursuing these strategic alternatives could divert management s attention and could result in significant costs to the company 
the ongoing grand jury investigation  albuterol related litigation and various other legal matters remain unresolved 
refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
although the company has established reserves as of december  it believed appropriate for these matters  the final outcome may exceed the estimates used in establishing those reserves and may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
capital resources and liquidity december  december  in millions cash and short term investments working capital long term debt shareholders equity working capital the company s combined cash and short term investments were million as of december  compared to million a year earlier 
the million increase primarily reflects million of cash generated from operations during offset by million of planned capital expenditures and million of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
the million of cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from a million decrease in accounts receivable  million of negotiated insurance recoveries  and million of net tax refunds 
during  the company spent million for machinery and equipment acquisitions and facility enhancements primarily related to the development and manufacturing of new products 
during the year ended december   the company spent million for capital expenditures which included the million buy out of substantially all of its leased manufacturing and research and development equipment and the acquisition of parcels of land adjacent to the canton  massachusetts manufacturing facility 
during the eleven month period ended december   the company spent million to complete the expansion of the canton  massachusetts plant  in addition to million of machinery and equipment acquisitions and facility enhancements to the company s existing manufacturing locations 
additions in all years were made from the cash generated from operations without incurring additional borrowings 
the company anticipates spending less than million for machinery and equipment acquisitions and facility enhancements during the year ending december  liquidity on july   the company amended its working capital line of credit agreement to increase its maximum borrowing capacity from million to million 
at december  the company had million in stand by letters of credit related to the albuterol settlement trust fund outstanding under this working capital line of credit agreement 
these stand by letters of credit were obtained by the company pursuant to the requirements of the albuterol settlement trust fund to cover its uninsured obligation 
recourse to the letters of credit is contingent upon the number of claims filed within certain categories and will not occur until all claims are processed and settlement amounts are recommended by the special master 
refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the settlement agreement 
the company continues to make annual payments of  on its outstanding industrial development revenue bonds the bonds  which are due in these bonds are secured by a letter of credit agreement 
subsequent to year end  the company received from its lender waivers to its credit agreements with respect to one of its financial covenants related to profitability  effective december  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional waivers in the future or  if required  that the lender will grant them 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain future waivers  if needed  the company s debt would be reclassified as short term debt and the company could lose its availability to cash under its line of credit 
the company believes that its current cash resources  cash generated from operations and the amount available under its amended working capital line of credit will be sufficient to meet its anticipated operating needs for the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require the company to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that such capital will be available at terms favorable or acceptable to the company  if at all
