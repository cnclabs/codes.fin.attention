the company s auto loan and credit card receivables business activities are subject to fluctuations in those consumer market places  as well as to competition from companies with much larger receivable portfolios 
auto loan and credit card portfolio results can also be influenced significantly by trends in the economy and credit markets that may negatively impact borrowers ability to repay loans 
credit card and auto loans receivable decreased from levels due to net paydowns of existing loans 
as a result of its improved auto loan collection efforts and enhanced systems supporting those activities  the company has experienced a decrease in delinquency rates and loan losses since september  any future increases in the company s investment in dealer auto loan and credit card portfolios are expected to be funded either through existing debt facilities and operating cash flows or through the securitization of a portion of the portfolios

management believes that the company s existing liquid assets  together with the expected continuing cash flow from operations  its borrowing capacity under current credit facilities and its ability to issue stock will be sufficient to meet its present and reasonably foreseeable cash requirements 
results of operations will continue to be dependent upon general economic growth  the strength of capital markets and the company s ability to meet investor demands with competitive products and services 
operating revenues will be dependent upon the amount and composition of assets under management  mutual fund sales  and the number of mutual fund investors  private and institutional clients 
operating costs are expected to increase with the company s continued expansion  the increase in competition and the company s continued commitment to improving its products and services 
despite the company s global presence  its exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency markets is limited because a substantial portion of its foreign subsidiaries revenues and the majority of their monetary assets are us and canadian dollar denominated 
over of the company s operating revenues were earned in us and canadian dollars in both and accordingly  the company has not deemed it necessary to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
the company participates in the financial derivatives markets to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on a portion of its commercial paper 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert interest payment obligations under variable rate debt instruments to fixed rate interest payment obligations 
through interest rate swap agreements and its medium term note program  the company has fixed the rates of interest it pays on of outstanding debt see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements
