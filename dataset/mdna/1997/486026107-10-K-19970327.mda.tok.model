the distribution and service group is primarily involved in the distribution of electronic components and nonpowered hand tools 
additionally  this group provides cold storage services and waste to energy services and produces specialty metal foils primarily for the electronic and medical industries 
the industrial and consumer manufacturing group produces sanitary maintenance supplies and electrical corded products  abrasives and stains for the consumer  maintenance  automotive and industrial markets 
the machinery manufacturing group manufactures machinery for the cookie sandwich  food processing and wood working industries and also manufactures testing and measuring instruments for the electrical and electronic markets and recording devices for the transportation industry and gauging and control systems for the metalworking industry 
katy intends to seek additional acquisitions to grow its electronic electrical distribution  do it yourself and sanitary maintenance businesses 
the table below and the narrative which follows summarize the key factors in the year to year changes in operating results 
years ended december  thousands of dollars distribution and service group net sales    income from operations    operating margin identifiable assets    depreciation and amortization    capital expenditures    industrial and consumer manufacturing group net sales    income from operations    operating margin identifiable assets    depreciation and amortization    capital expenditures   machinery manufacturing group net sales    income loss from operations    operating margin identifiable assets    depreciation and amortization   capital expenditures   corporate corporate expenses    identifiable assets    depreciation and amortization capital expenditures company net sales    income loss from operations    operating margin identifiable assets    depreciation and amortization    capital expenditures    compared to distribution and service group sales increased  or 
the acquisition of gc thorsen effective march   provided the majority of the increase due to having a full year of operations and increased market penetration during increased sales of other electronic components and increased sales in the rerolled metals area also led to the improved sales 
operating income for the group increased  or 
improved margins and a full year of operations at gc thorsen were the primary reasons for the improvement 
capital expenditures for the group decreased during the year due to expenditures made during for a plant expansion at the cold storage facility  that were not repeated in the industrial and the consumer manufacturing group s sales increased  or 
the increased sales were due to the acquisition of woods effective december  a full year of sales from gemtex  which was acquired in august  and increased sales throughout product lines from existing businesses  partially offset by the divestiture of the filter business in december  operating income for the group increased  or 
the improvement was due to higher margins and a full year of operations at gemtex  operating income generated at woods during december and the elimination of operating losses in at the filter business 
operating income in all other product lines was relatively comparable to the prior year 
the increase in identifiable assets for the group was due mainly to the acquisition of woods in december sales for the machinery manufacturing group decreased  or 
the deconsolidation of the schoen group and the disposition of b 
m 
root during contributed to most of this sales decrease 
an increase in sales at the cookie sandwich machinery line was offset by decreases in the wood processing machinery and gauging and control systems businesses 
operating income for the group increased  or 
losses at the schoen group during were the primary factor in this improvement during the year 
this improvement was offset by decreased income from operations at the wood processing machinery and the gauging and control systems due to lower sales volumes during corporate expenses in remained constant with expenses incurred in identifiable assets at corporate decreased during the year mainly due to lower cash levels at year end  as a result of the woods acquisition and the sale of union pacific corporation common stock during although the results of these operating groups can be significantly affected by the strength of the general economy  the company believes that it has positioned itself well in segments that can be expanded both externally through acquisitions particularly in the electronic electrical distribution  do it yourself and sanitary maintenance areas  and internally through new products  operational improvements and increased market penetrations 
following is a discussion concerning other factors that affected the company s net income 
gross profit increased  as gross margins improved to from in while selling  general and administrative expenses increased  in compared to the prior year 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of is mainly due to the increase in sales volumes during interest expense decreased  from as the company had no outstanding short term borrowings and lower long term debt 
borrowings in were incurred in connection with the gc thorsen acquisition 
interest income increased  during due to the company maintaining higher average cash and cash equivalent balances during compared to during  the company sold  shares of union pacific corporation common stock and  shares of union pacific resources corporation common stock  resulting in a pre tax gain of  during  the company sold  shares of union pacific corporation common stock  resulting in a pre tax gain of  also in  the company sold one half of its interest in schoen 
in connection with the sale  the company recorded a gain of  reflecting the reversal of previously recorded losses of schoen 
other  net in was income of  versus income of  in in  the company received settlements from various insurance companies in the amount of  in settlement of claims associated with environmental issues 
during the company recognized  of income due to similar settlements 
income from continuing consolidated operations before income taxes increased to  in from  in a  increase in income from operating units in was offset partially by the gains in described above 
provision for income taxes was  or an effective rate of in  and  or an effective rate of in the effective tax rate reflects the fact that the gains on the schoen sale were not tax effected  since the losses had not previously provided a tax benefit 
equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased  in due to the gain in recognized on the sale of syroco  inc by syratech  and the tax benefit realized from the reversal of taxes previously provided on katy s share of syratech s income  which is no longer required because of the sale of wsc liquidating and katy s holdings of syratech stock 
compared to distribution and service group sales increased  or 
the acquisition of gc thorsen effective march   provided the majority of the increase 
sales of cold storage services increased due to increased plant capacity brought on line during  waste to energy services increased due to increased market penetration  specialty metals increased due to new product lines  and electronics distribution increased due to increased market penetration 
operating income for the group increased  or 
the inclusion of gc thorsen was a major factor in the increase  along with sharply improved margins for waste to energy services and cold storage services 
specialty metals and electronics distribution also had slightly higher margins for the year  primarily due to higher volume 
capital expenditures for the group increased primarily due to a plant expansion at the cold storage facility and a major machinery addition at the specialty metals manufacturer 
the industrial and consumer manufacturing group s sales for the year increased for the year or  the addition of sales from gemtex effective august   along with increased sales of stains  offset decreases in the filter business  which was disposed of at year end 
increased marketing and penetration into new sales territories were the primary factors in the increase in stain sales 
operating income for the group decreased  or  primarily due to lower margins on filter products 
income in all other product lines was relatively comparable to the prior year 
pricing pressure from competitors was the main reason for the lack of income growth 
sales for the machinery manufacturing group decreased  or 
the dispositions of panhandle  a remanufacturer of machinery for the oil  gas and petrochemical industries  and the schoen group resulted in most of this sales decrease 
a decrease in sales of cookie sandwich machinery was offset by increased sales of food processing machinery  wood processing machinery and gauging and control systems 
these sales increases resulted from new products and increased market penetration 
operating income for the group increased  from the prior year 
inventory write downs of  in  which were absent in  were the primary factor in the increase 
the lower volume in cookie sandwich machinery resulted in a decline in operating income for that product line 
most other products showed modest increases in income 
corporate expenses in decreased  due primarily to lower environmental  insurance and legal costs 
following is a discussion concerning other factors which affected the company s net income 
gross profit increased  in as margins improved to from in the prior year  while selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or due in large part to lower corporate expenses 
interest expense increased  due to borrowings in connection with the purchase of gc thorsen  while interest income declined  due to the special dividend paid in which significantly reduced the company s interest bearing cash and cash equivalents balance 
during  company sold  shares of union pacific corporation common stock  resulting in a gain of  the company also sold one half of its interest in schoen cie  ag 
in connection with the sale  the company recorded a gain of  reflecting the reversal of previously recorded losses of schoen 
other  net in was income of  versus expense of  in other  net in was favorably impacted by the gain realized on the sale of wsc liquidating and katy s holdings of syratech stock of  in addition  in  the company received settlements from various insurance companies in the amount of  in settlement of claims associated with environmental issues 
other  net in was impacted by  of special charges for environmental costs and moving the corporate headquarters 
income from continuing consolidated operations before income taxes and minority interest was  in versus a loss of  in an  increase in income from operating units and the gains described above were the primary reasons for this change 
in addition  in  the company wrote off various assets in the amount of  income taxes of  or an effective rate of  reflect the fact that the gains on the schoen sale were not tax effected  since the losses had not previously provided a tax benefit 
the tax benefit in was adversely impacted by the fact that losses from schoen provided no tax benefit 
equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries increased in by  due to a gain recognized on the sale of syroco  inc by syratech and from the reversal of taxes previously provided on katy s share of syratech s income  which is no longer required because of the sale of wsc liquidating and katy s holdings of syratech stock

financial position and cash flow combined cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased  to  on december   from  on december   mostly due to the woods acquisition 
current ratios were to and to at december  and  respectively 
working capital increased  in the increase in working capital and in the current ratio in  primarily resulted from the acquisition of woods industries  inc in december of in august   katy s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to  shares of its common stock over the subsequent twelve months in open market transactions

in connection therewith  katy repurchased  of its common shares in the year ended december   at a total cost of  additionally  in the first two months of  the company repurchased  shares  at a cost of  bringing the total shares repurchased to  katy has authorized and expects to commit approximately  for capital projects in  exclusive of acquisitions  if any  and expects to meet these capital expenditure requirements through the use of available cash and internally generated funds 
the company continues to search for appropriate acquisition candidates  and may obtain all or a portion of the financing for future acquisitions through the incurrence of additional debt  which the company believes it can obtain at reasonable terms and pricing 
at december   katy had short and long term indebtedness of  secured by assets of its cold storage company 
total debt was of total debt and equity at december  katy has a commited unsecured line of credit with the northern trust company in the amount of  which is used principally for letters of credit

management continuously reviews each of its businesses 
as a result of these ongoing reviews  management may determine to sell certain companies and may augment its remaining businesses with acquisitions 
when sales do occur  management anticipates that funds from these sales will be used for general corporate purposes or to fund acquisitions 
acquisitions may also be funded through cash balances  available lines of credit and future borrowings

environmental and other contingencies in december   banco del atlantico  a bank located in mexico  filed a lawsuit against woods industries  inc  a subsidiary of the company  and against certain past and present officers and directors and former owners of woods industries  inc alleging that the defendants participated in a violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act involving allegedly fraudulently obtained loans from mexican banks  including the plaintiff  and money laundering of the proceeds of the illegal enterprise 
the plaintiff also alleges that it made loans to an entity controlled by officers and directors based upon fraudulent representations 
the plaintiff seeks to hold woods industries  inc liable for its alleged damage under principles of respondeat superior and successor liability 
the plaintiff is claiming damages in excess of  and is requesting treble damages under the statutes 
katy may have recourse against the former owners of woods under the purchase agreement  however  as the litigation is in preliminary stages  it is impossible at this time for the company to determine the limit of such recourse 
as the litigation is in preliminary stages  it is impossible at this time for the company to determine an outcome or reasonably estimate the range of potential exposure 
katy also has a number of product liability and workers compensation claims pending against it and its subsidiaries 
many of these claims are proceeding through the litigation process and the final outcome will not be known until a settlement is reached with the claimant or the case is adjudicated 
it can take up to years from the date of the injury to reach a final outcome for such claims 
with respect to the product liability and workers compensation claims  katy has provided for its share of expected losses beyond the applicable insurance coverage  including those incurred but not reported  which are developed using actuarial techniques 
such accruals are developed using currently available claim information  and represent management s best estimates 
the ultimate cost of any individual claim can vary based upon  among other factors  the nature of the injury  the duration of the disability period  the length of the claim period  the jurisdiction of the claim and the nature of the final outcome 
the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors  subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the us environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at a number of hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund and equivalent state laws and  as such  may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at these sites 
responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 
the means of determining allocation among prps is generally set forth in a written agreement entered into by the prps at a particular site 
an allocation share assigned to a prp is often based on the prp s volumetric contribution of waste to a site 
under the federal superfund statue  parties are held to be jointly and severally liable  thus subjecting them to potential individual liability for the entire cost of cleanup at the site 
the company is also involved in remedial response and voluntary environmental cleanup at a number of other sites which are not currently the subject of any legal proceedings under superfund  including certain of its current and formerly owned manufacturing facilities 
based on its estimate of allocation of liability among prps  the probability that other prps  many of whom are large  solvent  public companies  will fully pay the costs apportioned to them  currently available information concerning the scope of contamination  estimated remediation costs  estimated legal fees and other factors  the company has recorded and accrued for indicated environmental liabilities in the aggregate amount of approximately  at december  the ultimate cost will depend on a number of factors and the amount currently accrued represents management s best current estimate of the total cost to be incurred 
the company expects this amount to be substantially paid over the next one to four years 
the most significant environmental matters in which the company is currently involved are as follows the united states had alleged violations of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra based upon the alleged status of sludge drying beds of wj smith wood preserving company  a company subsidiary wj smith  as a hazardous waste management unit 
since  the company has spent in excess of  in undertaking cleanup and compliance activities in connection with this matter and has established reserves for future remediation activities 
an administrative order on consent was entered effective december   with estimated additional remediation costs of  during  the company reached agreement with the oregon department of environmental quality odeq as to a clean up plan for pcb contamination at the medford  oregon facility of the former standard transformer division of american gage 
the plan called for the company to provide a trust fund of  to fund clean up costs at the site 
these funds were expended in the plan also called for the present occupants of the site  balteau standard  inc to provide the next  of cost  with any additional costs to be shared equally between the two parties 
the company believes the clean up plan has been successful and has requested that the odeq inspect the property and approve the remediation work to release the company from any future liability 
in september of  katy received a letter from counsel to allard industries  inc allard requesting that katy and its subsidiaries  american gage and jei liquidating  inc  indemnify allard for any liability incurred by it in connection with a case captioned town of londonderry v 
exxon corporation  et al  case no 
c l united states district court  district of new hampshire 
such request stems from certain agreements among katy  allard and other parties 
the case at issue concerns the disposal and treatment of hazardous wastes and substances at a landfill site in londonderry  new hampshire the londonderry site  states claims under cercla and state law  and seeks  inter alia recovery of response costs with respect to the londonderry site  declaratory judgment with respect to the defendants liability for future response costs and unspecified monetary damages 
katy has agreed to defend and indemnify allard in this matter 
the parties in the lawsuit agreed to mediate the case 
the mediation resulted in a settlement in principle between the parties which will be memorialized in a consent decree 
under the expected consent decree  allard katy and several other parties will cash out and perform no future work at the site 
in exchange  allard and katy will receive a release and contribution protection 
allard katy s payment under the consent decree is expected to be approximately  payment will likely be due in in response to allard katy s demands for contribution  honeywell  a former owner operator of the manchester facility  has agreed in principle to pay  of the allard katy s settlement under the consent decree 
although management believes that these actions individually and in the aggregate are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company  further costs could be significant and will be recorded as a charge to operations when such costs become probable and reasonably estimable
