item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and liquidity the company s loan agreement loan agreement  provides for a total commitment of million  consisting of a revolving credit facility through august  and a term loan thereafter  maturing on august  borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to a borrowing base which is subject to a semi annual redetermination 
the latest borrowing base determination indicated million of the commitment is available to the company 
the loan agreement contains certain covenants which require the company to maintain consolidated net worth of at least million  a modified current ratio of not less than to  a ratio of long term debt  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to and a ratio of total liabilities  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to in addition  working capital provided by operations  as defined in the loan agreement  cannot be less than million in any year 
at december   borrowings under the loan agreement totaled million 
at february   borrowings under the loan agreement totaled million with million available for future borrowings 
the interest rate on the bank debt was and percent at december  and february   respectively 
at the company s election  any portion of the debt outstanding may be fixed at the london interbank offered rate libor rate for   or days with the remainder of the outstanding debt subject to the chase manhattan bank  n 
a 
prime rate 
during any libor rate funding period  the company may not pay in part or in whole the outstanding principal balance of the note to which such libor rate option applies 
at both december  and february   million of borrowings were subject to the libor rate 
a commitment fee of of percent is charged for any unused portion of the borrowing base 
shareholders equity at december  was million  making the company s ratio of long term debt to equity 
to the company s primary source of liquidity and capital resources in the near and long term will consist of cash flow from operating activities and available borrowings under the company s loan agreement 
net cash provided by continuing operating activities in was million as compared to million in the company s capital expenditures during were million 
the majority of the capital expenditures  million  were made in the company s oil and natural gas operations with million and million used for exploration and development drilling and producing property acquisitions  respectively 
capital expenditures made by the company s contract drilling operations were million in the drilling expenditures principally consisted of the purchase and refurbishment of two drilling rigs acquired in september  the refurbishment of two drilling rigs already owned by the company and the acquisition of over  feet of drill pipe 
the company s drilling rigs are composed of large components some of which  on a rotational basis  are required to be overhauled to assure continued proper performance 
such capital expenditures will continue in future years with approximately million projected for during  the company s oil and natural gas subsidiary plans to continue its focus on its developmental drilling as increased spot market natural gas prices in late and into early lessened the availability of economical producing property acquisitions 
the majority of the company s capital expenditures are discretionary and primary directed toward increasing reserves and future growth 
current operations are not dependent of the company s ability to obtain funds outside of the company s loan agreement 
the decision to acquire or drill on oil and natural gas properties at any given time depends on market conditions  potential return on investment  future drilling potential and the availability of opportunities to obtain financing given the circumstances involved  thus providing the company with a large degree of flexibility in incurring such costs 
depending  in part  on commodity pricing  the company plans to spend approximately million on its exploration capital expenditure program in at december   the company had million warrants outstanding 
the warrants entitled the holders to purchase one share of common stock at a price of per share 
prior to the warrants expiration on august   million warrants were exercised providing million in additional capital to the company 
the company continued to receive monthly payments on behalf of itself and other parties collectively the committed interest from a natural gas purchaser pursuant to a settlement agreement the settlement agreement 
as a result of the settlement agreement  the december  prepayment balance of million paid by the purchaser for natural gas not taken the prepayment balance is subject to recoupment in volumes of natural gas through a period ending on the earlier of recoupment or december  the recoupment period 
during  the purchaser is obligated to make monthly payments on behalf of the committed interest based on their share of the natural gas deliverability of the wells subject to the settlement agreement  up to a maximum of  or a minimum of  per month 
the monthly payments will end at the end of if natural gas is taken during a month  the value of such natural gas is credited toward the monthly amount the purchaser is required to pay 
in the event the purchaser takes volumes of natural gas valued in excess of its monthly payment obligations  the value taken in excess is applied to reduce any then outstanding prepayment balance 
the company currently believes that sufficient natural gas deliverability is available to enable the committed interest to receive substantially all of the maximum monthly payments during at the end of the recoupment period  the settlement agreement and the natural gas purchase contracts which are subject to the settlement agreement will terminate 
if the prepayment balance is not fully recouped in natural gas by december   then the unrecouped portion is subject to cash repayment  limited to a maximum of million  payable in equal annual payments over a five year period with the first payment due june  the company anticipates the maximum balance of million will be unrecouped at december  the price per mcf under the settlement agreement is substantially higher than current spot market prices 
the impact of the higher price received under the settlement agreement increased pre tax income approximately  and million in  and  respectively 
average oil prices received by the company in ranged from in february to in december 
the company s average price received for oil during was 
natural gas prices received by the company in ranged from an average of in september to an average of in december 
average natural gas prices received by the company were volatile throughout and averaged for the year as a whole 
average oil prices received early in the first quarter of were percent lower than average prices received by the company at december  while average natural gas spot prices dropped percent from the december  price 
oil prices within the industry remain largely dependent upon world market developments for crude oil 
prices for natural gas are influenced by weather conditions and supply imbalances  particularly in the domestic market  and by world wide oil price levels 
any drop in spot market natural gas prices would have a significant adverse effect on the value of the company s reserves and further large drops in prices could cause the company to reduce the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties 
likewise  declines in natural gas or oil prices could adversely effect the company operationally by  for example  adversely impacting future demand for its drilling rigs or financially by reducing the price received for its oil and natural gas sales and also by adversely effecting the semi annual borrowing base determination under the company s loan agreement since this determination is calculated on the value of the company s oil and natural gas reserves 
the company s ability to utilize its full complement of drilling rigs  is being restricted due to the lack of qualified labor and certain supporting equipment not only within the company but in the industry as a whole 
the company s ability to utilize its drilling rigs at any given time is dependent on a number of factors  including but not limited to  the price of both oil and natural gas  the availability of labor and the company s ability to supply the type of equipment required 
the company s management expects that these factors will continue to influence the company s rig utilization during in the third quarter of  the company s board of directors authorized the company to purchase up to  shares of the company s outstanding common stock on the open market 
since that time   shares have been repurchased at prices ranging from to per share 
during the first quarters of and   and  respectively  of the purchased shares were reissued as the company s matching contribution to its k employee thrift plan 
at december    treasury shares were held by the company 
on april   the company completed a business combination between the company s natural gas marketing operations and a third party also involved in natural gas marketing activities forming a new company called ged gas services  llc ged 
the company owns a percent interest in ged 
effective november  ged sold its natural gas marketing operations to a third party 
this sale removed the company from the third party natural gas marketing business 
the creation of ged and its subsequent sale of its marketing operations did not adversely affect the company s drilling and oil and natural gas exploration operations or the profitability of the company as a whole 
the discontinuation of the company s natural gas marketing segment was accounted for as a discontinued operation and accordingly  the and prior year financial information reflect this treatment 
effects of inflation the effects of inflation on the company s operations in previous years have been minimal due to low inflation rates 
however  during the third and fourth quarters of as drilling rig day rates and drilling rig utilization has increased  the impact of inflation has intensified as shortages in related equipment  third party services and qualified labor increased 
the impact on the company in the future will depend on the relative increase  if any  the company may realize in its drilling rig rates and the selling price of its oil and natural gas 
if industry activity continues to increase substantially  shortages in support equipment such as drill pipe  third party services and qualified labor will occur resulting in additional corresponding increases in material and labor costs 
these market conditions may limit the company s ability to realize improvements in operating profits 
results of operations versus net income for was  compared with  in increased natural gas production from new wells drilled along with higher oil and natural gas prices  contract drilling day rates and rig utilization all combined to produce the large increase in net income 
net income in included  gain from the sale of natural gas compressors and certain related support equipment which were sold for million in the first quarter and by the receipt of  in the third quarter from a settlement reached by two of the company s subsidiaries in certain litigation brought against the federal deposit insurance corporation and other parties

oil production remained virtually unchanged from levels 
average natural gas spot market prices received by the company increased by percent while volumes produced from certain wells included under the settlement agreement  which contains provisions for prices which are higher than current spot market prices  dropped by percent 
the impact of higher prices received under the settlement agreement increased pre tax income by approximately and million in and  respectively 
in  revenues from contract drilling operations increased by percent as average rig utilization increased from rigs operating in to rigs operating in  and daywork revenues per rig per day increased percent 
total daywork revenues represented percent of total drilling revenues in and percent in turnkey and footage contracts typically provide for higher revenues since a greater portion of the expense of drilling the well is born by the drilling contractor 
operating margins revenues less operating costs for the company s oil and natural gas operations were percent in compared to percent in increased operating margins resulted primarily from the increase in natural gas production and the increases in both oil and natural gas prices received by the company between the two years 
total operating costs increased percent primarily due to the additional costs associated with oil and natural gas production from new wells drilled in operating margins for contract drilling increased from percent in to percent in margins in improved due to increases in daily rig rates and utilization 
margins in were limited by initial start up costs incurred in the first quarter of to establish rigs in the south texas basin and by unusually wet weather conditions during the second quarter of which delayed rig moves and depressed rig utilization 
total operating costs for contract drilling were up percent in versus due to increased drilling rig utilization 
contract drilling depreciation increased percent in response to increased rig utilization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of oil and natural gas properties increased percent as the company increased its equivalent barrels of production by percent 
the company s average dd a rate per equivalent barrel declined from in to in general and administrative expenses increased percent as certain employee costs increased between the comparative years 
interest expense decreased percent as the average interest rate on the company s outstanding bank debt decreased from percent in to percent in the decrease in average interest rate was partially offset by an percent increase in bank debt outstanding in primarily due to the financing of new wells drilled and the additional rigs and drill pipe purchased during the company s effective income tax rate in recent years has been significantly impacted by its net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   the company s net operating loss and statutory depletion carryforwards has been fully recognized for financial reporting purposes  therefore  the company s effective income tax rate increased in to approximately the statutory rate 
versus net income for was  compared with  in while the company continued to increase natural gas production through producing property acquisitions and developmental drilling  lower natural gas prices limited corresponding increases in net income 
net income in the fourth quarter of was also further reduced by a  write down of certain rig components as the company elected to take of its drilling rigs out of service since economic conditions did not warrant the capital investment necessary to keep them in service 
the impact of lower natural gas prices on net income was partially offset by a  gain from the sale of natural gas compressors and certain related support equipment which were sold for million in the first quarter and by the receipt of  in the third quarter from a settlement reached by two of the company s subsidiaries in certain litigation brought against the federal deposit insurance corporation and other parties 
in the fourth quarter  the company also recognized a  net gain from the company s interest in the sale of ged s gas marketing operations and a  net income tax benefit 
total revenues from continuing operations increased to  in as compared to  in the company s net income included a net gain of  recognized in conjunction with the sale of one of the company s natural gas gathering systems 
oil and natural gas revenues increased percent due to a percent increase in natural gas production and a percent increase in oil production between and average oil prices received by the company increased percent while average natural gas prices received by the company decreased percent

operating margins revenues less operating costs for the company s oil and natural gas operations were percent in compared to percent in the reduction was primarily due to the decrease in prices received for the company s natural gas production which offset increases in production between the two years 
margins were also reduced by the shutting in of production on certain natural gas properties in the months of february and march due to low spot market natural gas prices 
total operating costs increased percent due to the additional costs associated with oil and natural gas production from new wells acquired and drilled in and operating margins for contract drilling decreased from percent in to percent in margins in were limited by initial start up costs incurred in the first quarter of to establish rigs in the south texas basin and by unusually wet weather conditions during the second quarter of which delayed rig moves and depressed rig utilization
