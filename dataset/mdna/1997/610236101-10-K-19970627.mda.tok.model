these expenses declined as a percentage of sales largely due to management s continued focus on discretionary spending and controlling costs

gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales  as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the reduction in gross profit as a percent of sales was due  in part  to an increase in purchases at the store level of certain higher cost parts
