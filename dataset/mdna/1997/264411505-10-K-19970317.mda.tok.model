in march  nareit issued a clarification of its definition of ffo effective for years beginning after december  the clarification provides that amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non rental real estate assets are no longer to be added back to net income in arriving at ffo 
the company adopted these changes effective january   and the calculations of ffo for the years ended december  and have been revised accordingly 
while management believes that ffo is the most relevant and widely used measure of the company s operating performance  such amount does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance  and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs
