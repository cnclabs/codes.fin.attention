liquidity and capital resources from inception to completion of its initial public offering  the company funded its activities principally from cash flow generated from operations  credit facilities with institutional lenders and  to a lesser degree  loans from its stockholders 
in june  the company completed an initial public stock offering  issuing a total of  new common shares which raised approximately  in proceeds to the company  net of fees and expenses 
a portion of these proceeds was used by the company to pay off borrowings on its line of credit and for other working capital purposes 
the remainder was invested in marketable securities with maturities generally ranging from one to three years 
the company has a credit agreement with a major bank providing a million revolving line of credit  with separate sublimits of million for the issuance of commercial letters of credit and million for actual borrowings 
the agreement  which expires february   is unsecured and carries an interest rate equal to prime minus  and also offers certain libor based interest options 
the agreement requires that the company satisfy certain financial covenants 
over the past several years  borrowings have varied  typically reaching highest levels in the pre christmas periods 
however  more recently the company has borrowed against its line of credit less frequently due to the ability to finance operations internally from cash and marketable securities available for sale 
balances on the line of credit are classified as current liabilities on the company s balance sheet

capital expenditures for fiscal totaled  compared to  during fiscal the decrease is primarily due to equipment purchases made in the prior year in connection with the construction of the company s new snowboard manufacturing facility 
of the fiscal total  approximately  represented machinery and equipment expenditures for the snowboard plant and  represented production molds and other related equipment  compared to  and  respectively  for such expenditures during the prior year 
future liquidity and financial position the company intends to continue to focus upon building and maintaining its existing product lines  including its new line of snowboards 
the company also plans to continue to devote resources toward the pursuit and development of new products  including its new line of quik shade tm instant canopies 
in addition  management continues to explore the possibility of making selected acquisitions of other companies or products which would offer a strategic fit with the company s existing products and its sourcing and distribution channels in the mass market 
the company also is considering expanding international distribution and developing additional distribution arrangements in order to take further advantage of growth opportunities which management believes exist for its products outside the united states 
management believes that its current cash position  funds available under existing banking arrangements  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s presently projected cash and working capital requirements for the next fiscal year assuming continued financial performance at present levels 
foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currency of its suppliers the new taiwan dollar has in the last three fiscal years had any significant adverse impact on the company s ability to purchase products at agreed upon prices 
typically  the company and its suppliers negotiate prices in new taiwan dollars 
at the same time  they will agree upon a fixed exchange rate for a specified period  generally three to six months 
the company s payments to suppliers are then made in us dollars based upon the agreed upon exchange rate 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not have an impact upon the company in the future
