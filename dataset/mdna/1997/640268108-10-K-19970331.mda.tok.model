item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in part i of this annual report under the heading risk factors 
overview since its inception in july  inhale has been engaged in the development of a pulmonary system for the delivery of macromolecule drugs for systemic and local lung applications 
the company has been unprofitable since inception and expects to incur significant and increasing additional operating losses over the next several years primarily due to increasing research and development expenditures and expansion of manufacturing facilities 
to date  inhale has not sold any products and does not anticipate receiving revenue from product sales or royalties in the near future 
for the period from inception through december   the company incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
inhale s sources of working capital have been equity financings  financings of equipment acquisitions  interest earned on investments of cash  and revenues from short term research and feasibility agreements and development contracts 
inhale typically has been compensated for research and development expenses during initial feasibility work performed under collaborative arrangements 
inhale s strategy is to enter into development contracts with pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporate partners after feasibility is demonstrated 
inhale expects that such partners will pay for research and development expenses and will make payments to inhale as it achieves certain key milestones 
inhale intends to receive a royalty from its partners based on revenues received from product sales  and to receive revenue from the manufacturing of powders and the supply of devices 
in certain cases  the company may enter into collaborative agreements under which the company s partners would manufacture powders or supply inhalation devices  thereby potentially limiting one or more sources of revenue for the company 
to achieve and sustain profitable operations  the company  alone or with others  must successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce  market and sell products utilizing its pulmonary drug delivery system 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate sufficient product or contract research revenue to become profitable or to sustain profitability 
results of operations years ended december   and contract research revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue increased in from levels and in from levels 
the year to year increases resulted from an increase in the number of research feasibility agreements with partners and development contracts as well as revenue earned in and by the company under its existing development agreements 
costs of contract research revenue approximate such revenue and are included in research and development expense 
contract revenues are expected to fluctuate from year to year  and future contract revenues cannot be predicted accurately 
the level of contract revenues depends in part upon future success in obtaining new collaborative agreements  timely completion of feasibility studies  the continuation of existing collaborations and achievement of milestones under current and future agreements 
nevertheless  the company expects higher contract revenues in as it performs its development activities under its collaborative development agreements 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenses represent proprietary research expenses as well as the costs related to contract research revenue and include salaries and benefits of scientific and development personnel  laboratory supplies  consulting services  facilities  costs of obtaining intellectual property protection for inhale s technologies and expenses associated with the development of manufacturing processes 
the million increase in research and development expenses in from and the million increase in research and development expenses in from were primarily due to the hiring of additional research personnel and increased expenses associated with expanding laboratory and clinical manufacturing facilities 
the company expects research and development and process development spending to increase significantly over the next few years as the company expands its proprietary development efforts under collaborative agreements and plans  builds and scales up a late stage clinical and early commercial manufacturing facility 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the  increase in general and administrative expenses in from and the  increase in from was due primarily to costs associated with supporting the company s increased research and development programs and accelerated business development efforts 
the company expects general and administrative spending to increase over the next few years as the company expands its operations 
interest income was million for the year ended december  as compared to million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the  increase in interest income in from was due primarily to interest earned on higher average cash balances as a result of baxter world trade corporation baxter making a million equity investment in inhale at a premium to market price in conjunction with the march development agreement between the company and baxter 
in addition  in october pfizer inc pfizer made an additional million investment in inhale pursuant to the january agreement between the company and pfizer to develop insulin products using inhale s non invasive pulmonary drug delivery system 
the increase of  in interest income in from was due primarily to higher cash balances as a result of the million net proceeds received from the company s follow on public offering of common stock in march in addition  in february pfizer made a million equity investment in inhale at a premium to market price in conjunction with the january agreement between the company and pfizer 
at december   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
these carryforwards will expire beginning in the year utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitation provided for by the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations primarily through public and private placements of its equity securities  contract research revenues  interest income earned on its investments of cash and financing of equipment acquisitions 
in its initial public offering completed may  the company raised net proceeds of approximately million and raised additional net proceeds of million in its public offering completed in march at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
the company s operations used cash of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts differed from the company s net operating losses in these periods due principally to depreciation expenses and increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
additionally  in  non cash amortization of deferred compensation expense of approximately  contributed to the difference between the net operating losses and cash used by operations 
the company added property and equipment of approximately million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company financed approximately  of these additions through lease agreements during the year ended december  the company did not finance additions through equipment financing agreements in or in february the company raised an additional million in net proceeds by completing a private placement of its common stock to a number of institutional investors 
under the agreements  the investors purchased million newly issued shares of inhale common stock  no par value  at a price of per share 
the company expects its cash requirements to increase due to expected increases in expenses related to the further research and development of its technologies resulting from a larger number of projects  development of drug formulations  process development for the manufacture and filling of powders and devices  marketing and general and administrative costs 
these expenses include  but are not limited to  increases in personnel and personnel related costs  acquisition of capital equipment  inhalation device prototype construction and facilities expansion  including the planning and building of a late stage clinical and early stage commercial manufacturing facility 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million including net proceeds from the private placement completed in february  when coupled with future contract revenues from collaborative development arrangements  future equity investments  interest income and possible additional equipment financings  will be sufficient to meet its operating expense and capital expenditure requirements at least through the company s capital needs will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in the research and development of the company s technology  the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others and the terms thereof  the resources that the company devotes to the development of self funded projects  payments received from partners under research and development arrangements  progress with preclinical and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of developing and the rate of scale up of the company s powder processing and packaging technologies  the timing and cost of its late stage clinical and early commercial production facility  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the need to acquire licenses to new technologies and the status of competitive products 
to satisfy its longer term liquidity needs  the company intends to seek additional funding  when needed  from corporate partners and from the sale of securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if and when required  will be available to the company on favorable terms  if at all
