item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of di industries  inc di or the company included elsewhere herein 
all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
industry overview the gap between the supply of workable rigs and demand for their services has decreased in recent months 
there are less rigs that are operational due to age of the fleet in the us and demand has increased for rigs in recent months 
the stabilization of working rig count that began in has continued into and and in fact an increase is now being seen 
the weekly national count of working land rigs in the united states as reported by hughes christensen incorporated on march  was compared to on march  the significant decline in oil and gas prices in the mid s severely depressed oil and gas exploration activities and reduced demand for the company s oil and gas drilling services 
although industry conditions have improved during and  a reversal of this trend could have an ongoing negative effect on the company s future operating results 
the decline in drilling activity in the mid s resulted in an oversupply of drilling equipment and created intense competition  particularly in the price received for contract drilling services by drilling contractors 
demand for oil and gas drilling services will continue to be dependent upon the present and anticipated sales price for oil and gas  which is subject to conditions such as consumer demand  events in the middle east  and other factors that are not controlled by the company 
there has been an increase in the demand for oil and gas drilling services in venezuela 
in response to this  the company expanded into venezuela during the company has also completed projects in south america and mexico  however  the company s only current operations are in venezuela 
the company will continue to market its services into selected international markets 
there is a general shortage in the industry of used drill pipe  and the cost of obtaining new and used drill pipe is substantially higher than in prior periods and is currently escalating 
at present  the company does not have a critical shortage of drill pipe or other equipment but  depending on rig utilization  will need to purchase additional drill pipe for rigs in service 
in response to this shortage  the company has formed an alliance with a drill pipe manufacturer to ensure a steady supply of new drill pipe to outfit the rigs that were acquired through the merger transactions mentioned above and for its existing rig fleet 
change in business strategy and management in early  the company began implementing a new business strategy which involved new management  a recapitalization of the company to provide for growth capacity and redeployment of the company s assets into higher margin markets

the merger transactions closed on august  financial condition and liquidity the company funded its activities other than the purchase price of acquisitions through a combination of cash generated from operations  cash sales of non strategic assets  short term loans from affiliates  a deferral of monthly payments otherwise due on debt  and issuances of its common stock and preferred stock in exchange for cash and operating assets 
with the exception of the diamond m acquisition  substantially all of the purchase price of the several acquisitions accomplished by the company during other than transaction costs was paid by the issuance of the company s common stock and common stock purchase warrants 
the merger transactions that occurred in august  described further below  significantly improved the company s financial position 
in the merger transactions  the company obtained net cash of approximately million and inactive  deep capacity drilling rigs in exchange for the issuance of common stock thus increasing working capital and net property and equipment

these changes are a direct result of the company s rebuilding process which began in the first quarter of on august   the shareholders of the company approved two merger transactions whereby the company exchanged a total of  shares of common stock for inactive  deep capacity land drilling rigs valued at approximately million and an equity infusion of million 
these merger transactions increased shareholders equity by million and property and equipment by million 
on october   the company acquired all the south texas operating assets of mesa drilling  inc in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock 
this transaction added six diesel electric scr drilling rigs to the company s rig fleet  three which are currently operating in south texas and three which are stacked 
this transaction increased both shareholders equity and property and equipment by approximately million 
on december   the company completed the acquisition of the south texas operating assets of diamond m onshore  inc diamond m for approximately million in cash 
the assets consist of ten land drilling rigs  all of which are currently operating  rig hauling trucks  a yard facility in alice  texas and various other equipment and drill pipe 
this resulted in an increase in property and equipment of approximately million and long term debt of million 
concurrent with the diamond m asset acquisition the company entered into a loan facility the facility dated as of december   with bankers trust company  ing us capital corporation and nordlandsbanken as which provided the funds for the acquisition 
the facility provides for an initial million reducing revolving line of credit which reduces by million each year until maturity on december  the facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets  calls for quarterly interest payments on the outstanding balance at either libor plus or the prime rate plus  and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants 
in connection with the company entering into the facility  the company utilized existing working capital to repay the million balance outstanding under its previous term loan agreement

the terms of the agreement call for grey wolf to merge with and into drillers  inc a subsidiary of di industries  inc subject to obtaining regulatory and grey wolf shareholders approval and certain other conditions 
grey wolf was founded in and is a premier gulf coast onshore drilling contractor with a high quality fleet of large drilling rigs currently working in south louisiana and the upper texas gulf coast 
the number of shares of the company s common stock to be issued in the merger is subject to decrease or increase if the average trading price of the company s common stock in the ten trading days prior to the merger is greater than or less than per share 
additionally  the merger agreement calls for the decrease of cash consideration and a corresponding increase in the number of shares issued so that at least of the value of the merger consideration consists of the company s common stock 
an escrow will be established for certain post closing contingencies with million of the cash consideration 
management anticipates the issuance of some form of debt or possibly equity financing to fund the cash portion of the acquisition price for grey wolf 
each of the company s completed or pending acquisitions have been or will be accounted for using purchase accounting 
as such all revenues and expenses have been or will be recorded by the company beginning at the date of acquisition 
the company will require substantial funding to complete the acquisition of grey wolf  complete its rig refurbishment program and continue operations 
the company does not currently have the borrowing capacity under the facility and does not anticipate cash flow from operations will fund its needs 
the company anticipates making up the shortfall with borrowing under new facilities or other debt agreements or possibly equity financing 
the company s liquidity at any time and the amount of cash available for operations  and reinvestment is affected by a number of factors including demand for and utilization of the company s operating drilling rigs prices received for daywork  footage and turnkey contracts  the demand for and refurbishment of rigs out of inventory  and the amount of bank borrowings and the extent of repayment of existing indebtedness 
during  the company made the decision to exit the argentina and mexico markets 
the drilling rigs previously operating in mexico have already been mobilized back to the united states  at a cost of approximately million  where they will be refurbished and returned to service

the company is still actively reviewing possible expansion and acquisition opportunities 
while the company has no definitive agreements to acquire additional equipment  other than as disclosed above  suitable opportunities may arise in the future 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable 
from time to time  the company may have one or more bids outstanding for contracts that could require significant capital expenditures and mobilization costs 
the company currently has several bids outstanding in venezuela that would require the refurbishment of a merger rig and the mobilization of that rig to venezuela 
the company s ability to consummate additional expansion or acquisition transactions will in part be effected by the company s ability to fund such transactions 
the company has no derivative contracts related to its foreign currency exposure in the countries that it operates 
however  the company generally structures its foreign operations and related drilling contracts in such a manner as to minimize any potential foreign currency exchange restrictions and any exposure for foreign currency fluctuations 
at december   the company believes that foreign currency exposure  if any  is not significant 
see further discussion in certain business risks international operations and risks within item business 
the company has not paid any cash dividends on the company s common stock and does not anticipate paying dividends on the company s common stock at any time in the foreseeable future

drilling expenses for mexico and argentina included million in mobilization cost to transport the company s drilling rigs from mexico to the united states 
drilling expenses in venezuela decreased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  also contributing to the decrease in operating expenses from foreign operations is million in cost related to non recurring export sales for the year ended december  drilling expenses from domestic operations increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased utilization but is also partially due to increasing direct labor costs 
depreciation expense decreased by less than  for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in depreciation expense is primarily attributed to the decrease in depreciable asset base resulting from the million impairment provision recorded in the fourth quarter of while the rto lrac merger transactions increased the company s asset base  the rigs will not be depreciated until they are placed in service 
only one of the merger rigs was placed in service late in during the year ended december  the company recorded non recurring charges of million which included million in employment severance costs  million dollars in cost to exit the argentina and mexico markets and

us operating expenses decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this decrease in cost from domestic operations is due to a change in the mix of the company s rig utilization from higher cost markets to lower cost markets and a change in the type of work from a greater percentage of turnkey in to a greater percentage of day work in in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no

the company has provided a non cash impairment provision of million for certain drilling rigs and equipment due to market indications that the carrying amounts were not fully recoverable 
net realizable value was determined based upon appraisal  comparable sale data and management estimates 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  this increase was due to the acquisition of drilling equipment for foreign operations 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december   primarily due to the expanded scope of foreign operations 
gain from foreign currency of  for the year ended december  is the result of currency exchange transactions derived from the venezuelan operations

the net loss from discontinued operations was  for the year ended december  as compared to net income of  for the twelve months ended december  the net loss in includes a  non cash provision resulting from the disposal of the company s oil and gas properties in august inflation and changing prices contract drilling revenues do not necessarily track the changes in general inflation as they tend to respond to the level of activity on the part of the oil and gas industry in combination with the supply of equipment and the number of competing companies 
capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas industry and to a lesser extent by changes in general inflation
