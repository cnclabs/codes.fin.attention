item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview in analyzing the company s results  investors should consider a variety of factors unique to the company and the heating oil industry 
these include the company s active acquisition program  the rapid rate of amortization of customer lists purchased in heating oil acquisitions and the company s recent transactions involving its propane operations 
first  the financial results of a given year do not reflect the full impact of that year s acquisitions 
in addition  acquisitions made during the spring and summer months generally have a negative effect on earnings in the calendar year in which they are made 
second  substantially all purchased intangibles have been comprised of customer lists and covenants not to compete 
amortization of customer lists is a non cash write off which is accounted for over a six year period and the balance over a year period 
the covenants not to compete are amortized over the lives of the covenants  which generally range from five to seven years 
third  as a result of the conversion of petro s propane operations  including the operations of star gas corporation star gas  into a master limited partnership in december  the star gas transactions  petro s results account for star gas performance on an equity basis

in april  the company recorded an extraordinary charge of million in connection with the refinancing of million of debt due in march this refinancing yielded a reduction in the borrowing rate on that debt of over in in the comparable period in  the company also recorded an extraordinary charge of million  when it refinanced million in long term notes that were scheduled to mature in june net loss 
net loss increased from million for to million for this was primarily due to the decline in home heating oil volume  increased interest expense associated with the company s acquisition of star gas  and an increase in non cash depreciation and amortization expense at star gas 
ebitda 
ebitda increased  or million  to million for  as compared to million for  due to an increase in ebitda of million at star gas  largely offset by the decline in heating oil volume and one time expenses related to the consulting study 
nida 
nida declined from million for to million for this decline was primarily due to the volume related home heating oil ebitda decline and increased interest expense associated with the company s acquisitions  primarily star gas 
liquidity and financial condition it has been the company s strategy to finance its growth through a combination of internally generated capital  the sale of common stock  and the issuance of redeemable preferred stock and debt 
in the past five years  acquisitions and other asset requirements have been financed in the following manner with internally generated cash and funds from common stock offerings  with redeemable preferred stock and long term debt  and from the net proceeds of the star gas transaction

approximately million of these funds were used in  million to repay long term debt and million reserved to guarantee the star gas partnership s minimum quarterly distribution 
in february  million of these funds were used to retire million of the company s million subordinated debentures due at an eleven percent premium 
for  the opening cash balance at january  of million and the receipt of star gas s minimum quarterly distribution of million representing three fourths of the anticipated annual distribution  combined with the net cash used in operating activities of million  amounted to million 
these funds were utilized in investing activities for acquisitions and the purchase of fixed assets of million and in financing activities to pay dividends of million  redeem preferred stock of million  repay notes payable of million  and repurchase subordinated notes of million as described in the preceding paragraph 
these financing activities were partially offset by cash provided by other financing activities of million which includes million of working capital credit facility borrowings  million of dividend reinvestment proceeds and the release of million from the star gas minimum quarterly distribution guarantee based upon the fulfillment of the guarantee provisions 
in addition  the sale of the company s springfield massachusetts operations generated million of proceeds 
as a result of the above activities  the company s cash balance decreased by million to million at december  the company currently has available a million working capital revolving credit facility 
at december  there were million of borrowings outstanding under this facility  and the company had million of working capital 
in february  the company completed the private placement of million of exchangeable preferred stock due proceeds from this placement will be used for general corporate purposes  including the company s operational restructuring and acquisition programs 
for  the company anticipates paying dividends on its common stock before dividend reinvestment of approximately million  repaying million of long term debt  redeeming million of redeemable preferred stock and paying million in preferred dividends 
based on the company s current working capital position  funds generated from the february sale of preferred stock  bank credit availability and expected net cash provided by operating activities  the company expects to be able to meet all of the above mentioned obligations in currently  the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures
