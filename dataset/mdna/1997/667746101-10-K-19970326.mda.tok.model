in december tubular products are manufactured in the company s portland  oregon and atchison  kansas facilities 
the company believes that the tubular products business  in conjunction with the water transmission business  provides a significant degree of market diversification  because the principal factors affecting demand for water transmission products are different from those affecting demand for tubular products 
demand for water transmission products is generally based on population growth and movement  changing water sources and replacement of aging infrastructure 
demand can vary dramatically within the company s market area since each population center determines its own waterworks requirements 
demand for tubular products is influenced by non residential construction  the agricultural economy and general economic conditions 
the company s net sales and net income may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the size of certain water transmission orders  the schedule for deliveries of those orders and the inventory management policies of certain of the company s tubular products customers 
the company has experienced such fluctuations in the past and may experience such fluctuations in the future 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period  and fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the common stock 
no assurance can be given that the company will remain profitable in any future period 
the company s business is subject to cyclical fluctuations based on general economic conditions and the economic conditions of the specific industries served 
future economic downturns could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

the settlement agreement does not represent a final settlement of the litigation 
a final binding settlement of the litigation will be effected only through the bankruptcy court s entry of a consent decree for the site

see item business environmental matters 
the company believes that a settlement of the litigation with the agencies can be achieved on substantially the terms set forth in the consent decree 
however  no assurance can be given that the company and the agencies will actually achieve a settlement or  if a settlement is not achieved  that the company will be successful in obtaining a judgment from the bankruptcy court that the confirmation of the plan discharged its liability to the agencies for environmental claims with respect to the site or that it will not ultimately be found to have liability with respect to the site 
if the company is ultimately found to have liability to the epa or to the odeq with respect to the site  no assurance can be given that such liability would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
