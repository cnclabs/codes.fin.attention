during and the first quarter of  ann taylor owned a interest in cat 
effective may   ann taylor s interest in cat increased to 
as a result of such change in ownership  ann taylor had  prior to the consummation of the ann taylor disposition  a interest in the net income of cat  which interest is reflected in cygne s consolidated statements of income as income attributable to minority interests 
the company completed the ann taylor disposition on september  in the transaction the company sold to ann taylor cygne s interest in cat  cygne s former sourcing joint venture arrangement with ann taylor  and the assets of cygne s ann taylor woven division that were used in sourcing merchandise for ann taylor

bernard manuel  the company s chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and mr 
irving benson  the company s then president and a director  to facilitate the integration of cat and the division into ann taylor s operations 
these agreements  which require an annual fee of  for the services of each of messrs

mr

net sales in include sales to the limited  inc by the company s fwm division  which operations were discontinued in  and by the gjm business  which was sold in february the limited  inc beneficially owns through an affiliated partnership of the outstanding cygne common stock 
if the ann taylor disposition had been consummated on february   the company would have had pro forma net sales for of million 
pro forma gross profit for would have been million

although cygne has a long established relationship with the limited  inc  its key customer  cygne does not have long term contracts with any of its customers  including the limited  inc since the consummation of the ann taylor disposition  the company has not had and does not anticipate that it will have sales to ann taylor 
the company has been dependent on its key customers and with the loss of ann taylor as a customer  its future success will be dependent upon its ability to attract new customers and to maintain its relationship with the limited  inc there can be no assurance that the limited  inc 
will continue to purchase merchandise from the company at the same rate or at all in the future  or that the company will be able to attract new customers 
in addition  as a result of the company s dependence on the limited  inc  particularly after the ann taylor disposition  the limited  inc has the ability to exert significant control over the company s business decisions  including prices 
furthermore  the limited  inc procures directly a substantial portion of its apparel product requirements through its sourcing subsidiary  and such subsidiary will continue to be a major competitor of the company with respect to the company s business with the limited  inc in addition  the apparel divisions of the limited  inc have formed internal design and product development groups as well as added direct sourcing departments 
in  sales to certain divisions of the limited  inc decreased significantly and  in  sales to certain divisions of the limited  inc with which the company continues to do business decreased 
the company expects sales to the limited  inc to continue to decrease  particularly with respect to woven products 
the company anticipates that it will have a net loss for the extent of the net loss will depend  among other things  on the amount of sales and related gross profit from sales to the limited  inc and from sales of  and start up expenses related to  kenzo jeans and kenzo studio brand name products 
the kenzo license agreements represent an opportunity for the company with respect to the sale of licensed brand name apparel 
however  the kenzo license agreements also represent a new area of the apparel business for the company which involves significant start up and ongoing risks and costs 
the company has limited experience in the sale of brand name apparel 
the sale of brand name apparel involves greater inventory risks and higher marketing expenses and collection and markdown costs than the sale of private label apparel 
there can be no assurance the company will be successful in exploiting the kenzo license agreements 
the apparel industry is highly competitive and historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variation  with purchases of apparel and related goods tending to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is low 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company believes that the weakness in retail sales of women s apparel adversely affected its operating results 
the effect of these factors has been increased competition and reduced operating margins for both the retailers and their suppliers 
retailers  including customers of the company  are increasingly designing and sourcing private label products themselves rather than utilizing outside vendors like the company

the company used a substantial portion of the proceeds to pay off all of its outstanding domestic indebtedness  and is using the balance of such proceeds for working capital purposes
