overview certain statements in this section are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation act of such statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially 
such risks  uncertainties and other factors include  but are not limited to the factors described below 
during the five year period ended december   the company s sales increased at an average compound annual rate of per year  from million in to million in income before income taxes increased at an average compound annual rate of  from million in to million in during the three years since the company s initial public offering of shares  net income increased at an average compound annual rate of  and shareholders equity increased from million as of december  to million as of december  while crossmann s management is committed to growing the company in a controlled and profitable manner  there are many factors outside the company s control 
the company s business and the homebuilding industry in general are subject to changes in economic conditions  including but not limited to employment levels  interest rates  the availability of credit  and consumer confidence 
the company s success over the past several years has been influenced by a variety of factors including favorable economic conditions in its principal markets  the availability of capital for expansion  and low interest rates 
to the extent these conditions do not continue  the company s operating results may be adversely affected 
the growth in the company s sales is principally attributable to increased unit sales  as price increases have been moderate 
future increases in sales and profitability will be largely dependent upon the ability of management to expand the company s operations in its current markets or in any new markets and continued control of operating costs 
there can be no assurance that these trends will continue  nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to successfully transfer its business strategy to new market areas  that new markets will offer the opportunities and stability of the company s existing markets  that government sponsored mortgage programs will not be changed or withdrawn  or that interest rates will not change substantially

wayne where they were down slightly 
management attributes increased volume in its markets to aggressive marketing programs and to the comparatively high value of the product compared to others offered in the marketplace 
average selling price was also higher   in  compared to  the average selling price is higher because of the higher contribution of sales from ohio 
in crossmann s ohio markets  most new homes are sold with basements while in indiana  most new homes are sold on a slab foundation 
the market preference for basements causes a higher selling price in the ohio divisions

selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from in to in management believes that the increase reflects higher general and administrative expenses incurred by the newer homebuilding divisions in southern indiana and louisville  kentucky

gross profit increased by million  or approximately for the year  representing of sales in as compared to in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales is attributable in part to increased contributions by the company to customers mortgage loan discount points 
the company is permitted to contribute up to six percent of the selling price toward closing costs  origination fees  and discount points under fha and va financing rules  and is more likely to make such contributions during periods of volatile interest rates 
it is likely the company will continue to make this expenditure to retain customers  when interest rates fluctuate 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales from in to in management believes that the decrease reflects increased income from the new homebuilding divisions in ft 
wayne and cincinnati and crossmann mortgage corp  this higher income helps to offset their related selling  general  and administrative overhead 
due primarily to the increase in unit sales  income before income taxes for increased approximately million over  or

the company s effective tax rate was in as compared to in liquidity and capital resources at december   crossmann had cash balances of  it is the company s policy to minimize unemployed cash generated by operations 
crossmann mortgage corp 
is required by the department of housing and urban development to have a minimum balance of cash or cash equivalents of  the company s primary uses of capital are home construction costs and the purchase and development of land 
real estate inventories were approximately million or of total assets at december  compared to approximately million or of total assets at december  to assure the future availability of developed lots for next year s operations  from time to time in the normal course of business the company contracts to purchase a portion of its developed lots from outside developers 
total commitments for these purchases was approximately million at december  the purchases of these lots are subject to various conditions imposed on both the sellers and the company 
capital is also used to add and improve equipment used in administering the business and for model home furnishings 
during  cash expenditures were financed with cash from operations and with borrowings from a million unsecured line of credit with bank one  indianapolis na and its participant  nbd  indianapolis na the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime lending rate  but permits portions of the outstanding balance to be committed for fixed periods of time at a rate equal to libor plus 
the credit facility matures march  for most of the year the company also had in place  in senior notes  payable over nine years at an interest rate of  held by the minnesota mutual life insurance company and combined insurance company of america 
on december   the company made its first scheduled reduction in the notes of  both the note agreements and the bank line of credit require compliance with certain financial and operating covenants and place certain limitations on the company s investments in land and unconsolidated joint ventures 
they also limit payments of cash dividends by the company 
the notes and the modifications to the banks credit agreement are expected to provide adequate liquidity for planned internal growth and capital expenditures 
in the event that the company seeks to accelerate growth through the acquisition of large parcels of land or of other homebuilders  additional capital may be necessary 
the company believes that such capital could be obtained from banks or other financing alternatives  from the issuance of additional shares  or from seller financing  however  there can be no assurances that the company would be able to secure the necessary capital 
inflation and effects of changing prices the company historically has been able to raise sales prices by amounts at least equal to its cost increases and accordingly has not experienced any detrimental effect from inflation 
housing demand  in general  is affected adversely by increases in interest rates 
if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  the company s sales of residential real estate could be adversely affected 
in addition  gross profit and net income can be affected as well because crossmann can assist buyers  subject to certain limitations by fha and va  by paying a portion of a customer s points and closing costs needed to help in securing a mortgage loan 
future trends management believes the company s profitability results in part from high volume production in its markets 
in  management will focus on building the kind of strong relationships with vendors and land sellers in its new markets in ohio and kentucky that it enjoys in its more established markets in central indiana 
management views land acquisition and zoning as the greatest challenges to its business in years to come 
the company will continue to seek to maximize the value of each parcel it purchases so that it can continue to serve its core customer
