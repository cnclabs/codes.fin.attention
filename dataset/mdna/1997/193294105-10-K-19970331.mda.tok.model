the company s primary funding requirements are to finance working capital and the continued growth of the business 
this includes the purchase of inventory in anticipation of increased sales as well as the capital expenditures related to the expansion of the retail operations 
during the first quarter of each year  the company normally experiences negative cash flows from operations due to the build up of inventory and the timing of collection of receivables due from factors relating to the peak spring sales period 
cash flows may vary from time to time as a result of seasonal requirements  the timing of the receipt of merchandise from suppliers and the delivery by the company of the merchandise to its customers  the company s open stock inventory program and the level of accounts receivable and due from factors balances

the retail industry has experienced significant changes and difficulties over the past several years  including consolidation of ownership  increased centralization of buying decisions  restructurings  bankruptcies and liquidations

the payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of the company s board of directors and will depend upon  among other things  future earnings  operations  capital requirements  the financial condition of the company and general business conditions 
seasonality the company s products are marketed primarily for fall and spring seasons  with slightly higher volume of wholesale products sold during the first and third quarters 
the company s retail operations generally experience their strongest results in the fourth quarter and their weakest in the first quarter 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced over the last few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability
