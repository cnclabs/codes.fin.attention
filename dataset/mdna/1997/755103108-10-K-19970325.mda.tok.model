future liquidity since the formation of raytech and the restructuring that occurred in  raytech has been named a co defendant in approximately  asbestos related lawsuits as a successor in liability to raymark 
until february  the defense of all such lawsuits was provided to raytech by raymark in accordance with the indemnification agreement included as a condition of the purchase of the wet clutch and brake division and the german subsidiary from raymark in in february  an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against raymark  and subsequently  a restrictive funding order was issued by an illinois circuit court which required one of raymark s insurance carriers to pay claims but not defense costs and another insurance carrier had been declared insolvent 
these circumstances caused raymark to be unable to fund the costs of defense to raytech in the asbestos related lawsuits referenced above as provided in the indemnity section of the acquisition agreement 
in an asbestos related personal injury case decided in october in a us district court in oregon  raytech was ruled under oregon equity law to be a successor to raymark s asbestos related liability 
the successor ruling was appealed by raytech and in october  the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court s judgment on the grounds stated in the district court s opinion 
the effect of this decision extends beyond the oregon district due to a third circuit court of appeals decision in a related case cited below wherein raytech was collaterally estopped precluded from relitigating the issue of its successor liability for raymark s asbestos related liabilities  and a petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the us supreme court in october as the result of the inability of raymark to fund raytech s costs of defense recited above and in order to obtain a ruling binding across all jurisdictions as to whether raytech is liable as a successor for asbestos related and other claims  including claims yet to be filed relating to the operations of raymark and its predecessors  on march   raytech filed a petition seeking relief under chapter of title  united states code in the united states bankruptcy court  district of connecticut 
under chapter  substantially all litigation against raytech has been stayed while the debtor corporation and its non filed operating subsidiaries continue to operate their businesses in the ordinary course under the same management and without disruption to employees  customers and suppliers 
in the bankruptcy court a creditors committee was appointed  comprised primarily of asbestos claimants attorneys 
in august  an official committee of equity security holders was appointed for a limited time relating to a determination of equity security holders interest in the estate 
in june raytech filed a class action in the bankruptcy court against all present and future asbestos claimants seeking a declaratory judgment that it not be held liable for the asbestos related liabilities of raymark 
it was the desire of raytech to have this case heard in the us district court  and since the authority of the bankruptcy court is referred from the us district court  upon its motion and argument the us district court withdrew its reference of the case to the bankruptcy court and thereby agreed to hear and decide the case 
in september  the us district court issued a ruling dismissing one count of the class action citing as a reason the preclusive effect of the oregon case under the doctrine of collateral estoppel conclusiveness of judgment in a prior action  in which raytech was ruled to be a successor to raymark s asbestos liability under oregon law 
the remaining counts before the us district court involve the transfer of raymark s asbestos related liabilities to raytech on the legal theories of alter ego and fraudulent conveyance 
upon a motion for reconsideration  the us district court affirmed its prior ruling in february also  in february  the us district court transferred the case in its entirety to the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
such transfer was made by the us district court without motion from any party in the interest of the administration of justice as stated by the us district court 
in december  raytech filed a motion to activate the case and to obtain rulings on the remaining counts which was denied by the us district court 
in october  the creditors committee asked the court to certify the previous dismissal of the successor liability count 
in february  the us district court granted the motion to certify and the successor liability dismissal was accordingly appealed 
in may  the third circuit court of appeals ruled that raytech is collaterally estopped precluded from relitigating the issue of its successor liability as ruled in the oregon case recited above  affirming the us district court s ruling of dismissal 
a petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the us supreme court in october the ruling leaves the oregon case  as affirmed by the ninth circuit court of appeals  as the prevailing decision holding raytech to be a successor to raymark s asbestos related liabilities 
the adverse ruling in the third circuit court of appeals  of which a petition for writ of certiorari was denied by the us supreme court  precluding raytech from relitigating the issue of its successor liability leaves the us district court s oregon ruling as the prevailing decision holding raytech to be a successor to raymark s asbestos related liabilities 
this ruling could have a material adverse impact on raytech as it does not have the resources needed to fund raymark s potentially substantial uninsured asbestos related and environmental liabilities 
determination of raytech s actual liabilities are subject to the bankruptcy court s deliberations and rulings and the competing plans of reorganization filed in the bankruptcy court referenced above 
the ultimate liability of the company with respect to asbestos related  environmental  or other claims cannot presently be determined 
accordingly  no provision for such liability has been recorded in the financial statements 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
an unfavorable result on the matters described above would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
these uncertainties raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or adjustments relating to establishment  settlement and classification of liabilities that may be required in connection with reorganizing under the bankruptcy code 
the company has a long term obligation to raymark resulting from the purchase of the wet clutch and brake business and the german subsidiary in at december   the amount owed raymark was approximately million 
in december the company reached an agreement with raymark to restructure its obligations resulting in the reduction of the interest rate from to  replacing a required balloon payment that was due in october of with an amortization schedule requiring equal monthly installments of through july of to be paid into an escrow account and suspension of payments due under the german stock acquisition until the assets purchased are free of all raymark related encumbrances and liabilities 
subsequently  in may  the monthly installments were suspended  and the escrow account containing previously paid installments was retracted pending the assets purchased being free of raymark related encumbrances and liabilities 
in february  monthly installlments of were resumed to ensure indemnification of raymark liabilities in the event the raytech bankruptcy is dismissed pursuant to the pending motion to dismiss and claims for raymark liabilities are levied against raytech 
the principal of the debt owed raymark was adjusted to reflect payments  accrued interest and indemnity offsets resulting in a revised promissory note in the amount of  the debt obligations related to the german subsidiary are denominated in dm s and amount to  at december  as such  the company is at risk to future currency fluctuations with respect to this debt 
while the company experienced improving conditions in its domestic market segments during fiscal  management is cautiously optimistic about sustained improvement through fiscal and is projecting only modest growth in its forecast 
subject to the outcome of the legal matters discussed above  management believes that the company will generate sufficient cash flow during to meet all of the company s obligations arising in the normal course of business 
in addition  in the event the company falls short of its cash flow forecast  the company has an available line of credit with the cit group credit finance  inc impact of inflation the company s business is subject to the impact of inflation 
during the past year  this impact has been minimal 
management s strategy is to try to reclaim any cost increases through more efficient manufacturing and when competitively feasible  higher selling prices
