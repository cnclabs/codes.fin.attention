the analysis below reflects the distribution of pricesmart and the presentation of the merchandising segment as discontinued operations for all years presented  see note in those instances where changes are attributed to more than one factor  the factors are presented in descending order of importance

real estate rental operations rental percent operating percent income change income change change fiscal    fiscal    fiscal   for purposes of this discussion  operating income is defined as rental revenue  including common area expense reimbursements  less the related real estate expenses  including all unreimbursable expenses associated with unimproved land and certain developed properties with vacant space 
in addition  operating income reflects depreciation expense  but it does not reflect property write downs for asset impairment  gain loss on sale of real estate or corporate general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal  the increase in revenue was due primarily to increased lease up of the dallas tx property which began leasing activity during fourth quarter fiscal other factors include additional lease up at properties located in bakersfield ca and philadelphia pa 
these increases were almost entirely offset by loss of revenue from the seekonk ma property as a result of the bradlees bankruptcy during the past year as well as the write off of related receivables associated with bradlees 
there also was a loss of revenue due to the sale of the richmond ca location in the latter part of fiscal during fiscal  the increase in revenue was due primarily to increased lease up of the pentagon city va property  which was not fully leased until mid year fiscal other factors include additional lease up of the bensalem pa property as well as the dallas tx property which was under development during fiscal and began leasing activity during fourth quarter fiscal these increases were somewhat offset by a decline in revenues from the phoenix az property  which was sold in march of adjusted funds from operations less add adjusted operating straight line depreciation funds from percent income rentals expense operations change fiscal     fiscal     fiscal     real estate industry analysts generally consider funds from operations ffo to be a supplemental measure of performance for real estate oriented companies 
as defined by the national association for real estate investment trusts nareit  ffo is the pretax income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of property  after adding back depreciation and amortization expense 
the company historically has calculated its adjusted ffo on a segment basis excluding corporate overhead as well as interest and other income 
in addition  due to the significance of straight line rent accruals  which represent noncash revenues associated with fixed future minimum rent increases  the company has adjusted the nareit definition to eliminate straight line rents when computing its adjusted ffo 
adjusted ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
for fiscal and  the growth in adjusted ffo reflects many of the factors mentioned in the revenue and operating income discussion above

additional increases are attributed to severance expense for executive officers that left the company during the year for which no comparable expense was recorded in the prior year 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in expense  compared to the prior year  because of the million expensed in fiscal related to the settlement of the costco stockholder litigation 
during fiscal  the increase in expenses was due primarily to an accrual of million pursuant to a tentative agreement to settle the costco stockholder litigation

such property was included in the properties held for sale  net of provision for asset impairments  that were transferred to pricesmart in the distribution 
interest income net percent amount change change fiscal  fiscal   fiscal  during fiscal  the increase in net interest income was due primarily to higher interest income on invested cash balances as well as a reduction to interest expense related to the costco note payable that was repaid during the fourth quarter of fiscal this net improvement was somewhat offset by reductions in interest income from a note receivable from atlas hotels due to its repayment during the third quarter as well as the city and other notes due to principal reductions of million and a reduction in capitalized interest due to less construction activity in the current fiscal year

discontinued operations percent amount change change fiscal   fiscal   fiscal  the decrease in the net loss from operations of the discontinued merchandising segment during fiscal was primarily a result of decreased expenses upon the expiration of certain contractual obligations to pay costco million per year for marketing related activities  as well as increases in sales and gross margin due to the opening of the panama city location in october and increases in sales of us sourced products to licensees 
the discontinued merchandising segment was transferred to pricesmart in the distribution 
the decrease in the net loss from operations of the discontinued merchandising segment during fiscal was primarily a result of the electronic shopping program discontinuing display samples and in store staffing at costco locations  and a reduction of central office staffing 
in addition  other revenues increased primarily as a result of royalties from the newly established licensee operations as well as certain fees for license arrangements 
liquidity and capital resources following the distribution of pricesmart at year end  the company retained million in cash 
while the company is well positioned to finance its business activities through a variety of sources  it expects to satisfy short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations 
to the extent that investment opportunities exceed available cash flow from operations  the company believes that its unleveraged balance sheet will enable it to raise additional capital through bank credit facilities and or securitized debt offerings 
the company also may choose to seek additional funds through future public offerings of debt or equity securities 
consistent with historical trends  operating income from real estate activities increases as properties are developed and declines as properties are sold 
the company s liquidity is primarily affected by the timing and magnitude of rental property acquisition  development and disposition 
in addition  the company s liquidity may be affected by the anticipated payment of quarterly cash dividends to stockholders in the future 
see item five market for registrant common equity and related stockholder matters 
through calendar  the company anticipates investing approximately million in commercial real estate development on owned property a portion of which represents commitments under executed construction contracts and approximately million for real estate acquisitions

the preferred stock would carry a quarterly dividend  would be convertible at the option of the holder at a conversion price of per share and would be redeemable at the option of the company five years after issuance 
the preferred stock would vote with the company s common stock on an as converted basis 
the company s proposal is subject to completion of due diligence  board of directors approval  the execution of a definitive merger agreement  the receipt of a fairness opinion and stockholder approval  as well as other customary conditions 
on november   price reit announced that its board of directors would evaluate the proposal 
inflation because a substantial number of the company s leases contain provisions for rent increases based on changes in various consumer price indices  based on fixed rate increases  or based on percentage rent if tenant sales exceed certain base amounts  inflation is not expected to have a significant material impact on future net income or cash flow from developed and operating properties 
in addition  substantially all leases are triple net  whereby specific operating expenses and property taxes are passed through to the tenant 
for undeveloped or under developed properties  inflation could increase the company s cost of carrying and developing the properties  however  inflation would likely increase the future sales value of the properties
