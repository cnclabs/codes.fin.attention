item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share data the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company included in part ii  item of this form k 
overview on january   the company changed its name from dovatron international  inc to the dii group  inc 
the dii group or the company 
as more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  dii merger corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of the dii group  inc  merged the merger with orbit semiconductor  inc orbit on august  and orbit became a wholly owned subsidiary of the dii group 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  accordingly  all prior period financial statements have been restated to reflect the combined operations of the two companies 
on august   the company changed its fiscal year end from december to the sunday nearest to december  beginning with the fiscal year ended december  accordingly  the accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  each fiscal year contained approximately weeks and is referred to herein as fiscal  and  respectively 
the company is a value added electronics design  engineering and manufacturing service provider which operates through a global network of companies in north america  europe and southeast asia 
these companies are uniquely integrated to provide a broad range of related products and services  including semiconductor design and manufacturing of customer specific integrated circuits  initial printed circuit board design  manufacturing of prototype printed circuit boards  assembly of printed circuit boards  process tooling  machine tools  in circuit and functional test hardware and software  and final system configuration 
by being the fastest and most comprehensive provider of custom quick turn design  engineering and manufacturing services for oem customers  from microelectronics circuits through the final assembly of finished products  the company believes it is better able to develop long term relationships with its customers  expand into new markets and enhance its profitability 
the company provides the following products and services to the global electronics outsourcing industry custom semiconductors the company designs and manufactures customer specific integrated circuits on a quick turn basis through orbit 
this product line accounted for  and of the company s net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
high performance printed circuit boards the company designs and manufactures high density  complex multilayer printed circuit boards on a quick turn basis through multek 
this product line accounted for and of the company s net sales in fiscal and  respectively  and less than of the company s net sales in fiscal systems assembly and distribution the company assembles complex electronic circuits and final system configuration contract electronics manufacturing or cem on a high and low volume contract basis through dovatron 
this product line accounted for  and of the company s net sales in fiscal  and  respectively

this product line accounted for of the company s net sales in fiscal and less than of the company s net sales in fiscal and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dollars in thousands  except per share data overview continued operating results may be affected by a number of factors including the economic conditions in the markets the company serves  price and product competition  the level of volume and the timing of orders  product mix  the amount of automation existing on specific manufacturing projects  efficiencies achieved by inventory management  fixed asset utilization  the level of experience in manufacturing a particular product  customer product delivery requirements  shortages of components or experienced labor  start up costs associated with adding new geographical locations  expenditures required for research and development  and failure to introduce  or lack of market acceptance of  new processes  services  technologies and products on a timely basis 
in addition  the level of sales can greatly shift based on whether certain projects are contracted on a turnkey basis where the company purchases materials  versus a consignment basis where materials are provided by the customer 
a majority of the company s sales are to customers in the electronics industry  which is subject to rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price competition 
the factors affecting the electronics industry especially the semiconductor sector in general  or any of the company s major customers  in particular  could have a material adverse affect on the company s operating results 
the electronics industry especially the semiconductor sector has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and overcapacity 
the company seeks a well balanced customer profile across most sectors of the electronics industry in order to reduce exposure due to a downturn in any particular sector 
the primary sectors within the electronics industry served by the company are data communications  computer and peripherals  telecommunications  industrial  instrumentation  and medical 
the company offers outsourcing capabilities in three major electronics markets of the world north america  europe and southeast asia 
the company s international operations generated approximately  and of total net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s international operations subject the company to the risks of doing business abroad  including currency fluctuations  export duties  import controls and trade barriers  restrictions on the transfer of funds  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and  in certain parts of the world  political instability 
from time to time  some of the company s customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with the company  and other customers have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of design  engineering and manufacturing services from the company 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse affect on the company s operating results 
although management believes the company has a broad diversification of customers and markets  the company has no material firm long term commitments or volume guarantees from its customers 
at any given time  certain customers may account for significant portions of the company s business 
no customer accounted for more than of net sales during fiscal standard microsystems corporation smc accounted for and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
seagate technology  inc seagate accounted for and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of net sales during fiscal or the company s top ten customers accounted for  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the percentage of the company s sales to its major customers may fluctuate from period to period 
significant reductions in sales to any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company s contracts generally do not provide the dii group with any firm long term volume purchase commitments 
in addition  customer contracts can be canceled and volume levels can be changed or delayed 
the timely replacement of canceled  delayed or reduced contracts with new business cannot be assured 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dollars in thousands  except per share data acquisitions the dii group has actively pursued acquisitions in furtherance of its strategy to be the fastest and most comprehensive provider of custom quick turn design  engineering and manufacturing services for oem customers  from microelectronics circuits through the final assembly of finished products 
moreover  the company s acquisitions enable the dii group to provide more integrated outsourcing technology solutions with time to market and lower cost advantages  thereby enhancing its position as a leading provider of value added design  engineering and manufacturing solutions 
these acquisitions have played an important part in broadening the company s presence in the global electronics marketplace  thereby enhancing the dii group s capability to provide a comprehensive outsourcing technology solution and global electronics design  engineering and manufacturing services to a market increasingly dependent on outsourcing providers 
acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  and products and services of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the dii group has no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
the integration of certain operations following an acquisition will require the dedication of management resources that may distract attention from the day to day business of the company 
see note of the company s consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for information regarding acquisitions 
foreign currency exposure the company conducts a significant amount of its business and has a number of operating facilities in countries outside of the united states 
as a result  the company may experience transaction and translation gains and losses because of currency fluctuations 
in order to minimize foreign exchange transaction risk  the company selectively hedges certain of its foreign exchange exposures through forward exchange contracts  principally relating to nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities 
to date  the company s hedging activity has been immaterial 
the strategy of selective hedging can reduce the company s vulnerability to certain of its foreign currency exposures  and the company expects to continue this practice in the future 
operating results fiscal compared to fiscal total net sales in fiscal increased  to  from  in fiscal contract electronics manufacturing  which represented of net sales in fiscal  increased  to  from  of net sales in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the start up of the dovatron facility in clearwater  florida in november  offset in part by certain dovatron customer deferrals and cancellations during fiscal more specifically  the planned phase out of dovatron malaysia s largest customer seagate was accelerated and certain other customers reduced their orders during the second half of the year 
net sales for the company s other products and services  which represented of net sales in fiscal  increased  to  from  of net sales in fiscal this increase is attributable to sales to existing customers  an expanding customer base  and the commencement of production at the multek facility located in roseville  minnesota  which began limited production in april  combined with the acquisitions of tti testron and chemtech in august and april  respectively 
these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases with the results of operations of the acquired businesses included in the company s results of operations from the acquisition dates forward 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dollars in thousands  except per share data operating results fiscal compared to fiscal continued excluding non recurring charges  gross profit in fiscal increased  to  from  in fiscal excluding non recurring charges  the gross margin decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of i under absorbed overhead as a result of the accelerated phase out of dovatron malaysia s largest customer combined with certain other dovatron customer order reductions and reschedules during the second half of the year  ii pricing pressures relating to the decrease in the book to bill ratio in the semiconductor market  and iii orbit s under absorbed overhead associated with bringing its recently acquired inch  micron facility on line  while winding down its inch  micron wafer fabrication facility 
this transition process will be completed in stages through the end of the first shipment from the new orbit facility is expected to occur in the second quarter of and the old facility is expected to be closed by the end of therefore  continued pressure on the company s gross margin is expected to continue through at least the first half of this new facility with larger wafer sizes and finer geometries will result in lower manufacturing costs which should allow for more competitive pricing 
sg a expense increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the percentage of sg a expense to net sales was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
this is mainly attributable to i additional costs associated with the start up of both multek s facility in roseville  minnesota  and orbit s newly acquired wafer fabrication facility while winding down its old wafer fabrication facility  ii the tti testron and chemtech acquisitions  which have product lines that carry higher sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales and iii the building of the company s sales and marketing  finance and other general and administrative infrastructure necessary to support the company s projected sales growth in fiscal interest income decreased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal this change is attributable to the earnings generated on the invested cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is mainly attributable to the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes in october as well as the increase in long term financing obligations in connection with orbit s newly acquired wafer fabrication facility 
amortization expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is attributable to the amortization of the debt issue costs associated with the convertible subordinated notes issued in october and the amortization of the goodwill associated with the tti testron and chemtech acquisitions 
other income net decreased for fiscal mainly as the result of increased provisions for doubtful accounts receivable and lower net gains realized on the sales of property  plant and equipment in fiscal as compared to fiscal in the fourth quarter of  the company increased the estimated useful lives of certain equipment from four years to six years 
the effects of this change in accounting estimate were to decrease fiscal depreciation expense by approximately  and to increase net income by approximately  the non recurring charges amounted to  and consisted of  of costs associated with the orbit merger and  of costs associated with the closing of orbit s inch  micron wafer fabrication facility and its move into a newly acquired inch  micron facility 
the  of costs include provisions of i  associated with the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of associated with the closing of orbit s inch  micron wafer fabrication facility  ii  for inch wafer inventory not recoverable on the inch fabrication process  iii  associated with the write off of orbit s investment in a subsidiary established to expand orbit s manufacturing capacity in israel  and iv of accrued expenses management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dollars in thousands  except per share data operating results fiscal compared to fiscal continued associated with the closing and exit costs of orbit s inch  micron wafer fabrication facility 
the israeli expansion was no longer required with the acquisition of the inch  micron facility 
the company s estimated effective income tax rate differs from the us statutory rate due to domestic tax credits and lower effective income tax rates on foreign earnings considered permanently invested abroad 
the effective tax rate for a particular year will vary depending on the mix of foreign and domestic earnings and tax credits 
as foreign earnings considered permanently invested abroad increase as a percentage of consolidated earnings  the overall consolidated effective income tax rate will usually decrease because the foreign earnings are generally taxed at a lower rate than domestic earnings 
foreign income from operations before income taxes and extraordinary item amounted to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
domestic income from operations before income taxes and extraordinary item amounted to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
this mix of foreign and domestic income from operations before income taxes and extraordinary item and tax credits resulted in an estimated effective income tax rate of and in fiscal and  respectively 
certain orbit merger costs were not deductible for income tax purposes in excluding the merger costs  the effective income tax rate for fiscal was 
the convertible subordinated notes are potentially dilutive securities and therefore require the company to report fully diluted earnings per share 
the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share in reflects the fact that the convertible subordinated notes were not outstanding for the entire year 
for purposes of the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share in  the convertible subordinated notes were antidilutive for operating results fiscal compared to fiscal total net sales in fiscal increased  to  from  in fiscal contract electronics manufacturing  which represented of net sales in fiscal  increased  to  from  of net sales in fiscal this increase is attributable to sales to existing customers  an expanding customer base  and dovatron s acquisitions in july and may of of sistemas inteligentes ceretronik  known today as dovatron de mexico  and the thielen group  inc  known today as dovatron southern california 
these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases with the results of operations of the acquired businesses included in the company s results of operations from the acquisition dates forward 
net sales for the company s other products and services  which represented of net sales in fiscal  increased  to  from  of net sales in fiscal this increase is attributable to sales to existing customers  an expanding customer base  and the august acquisition of tti testron and the september acquisitions of multilayer technology multek and test technology 
these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases with the results of operations of the acquired businesses included in the company s results of operations from the acquisition dates forward 
excluding non recurring charges  gross profit for fiscal increased  to  from  for fiscal excluding non recurring charges  the gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase is attributable to the acquired businesses included in the company s results of operations from the acquisition dates forward 
the dovatron acquisitions have a higher mix of consignment customers  where materials are provided by the customer and therefore generate lower sales and higher margins 
in addition  the multek  test technology and tti testron acquisitions generate higher margins due to the fact that they sell their products and services to design engineers who require quick turn service to increase speed to market 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dollars in thousands  except per share data operating results fiscal compared to fiscal continued sg a expense increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the percentage of sg a expense to net sales was and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of net sales is attributable to higher advertising and promotional spending at orbit  and the acquired businesses included in the company s results of operations from the acquisition dates forward 
this results from the acquired dovatron cem companies carrying a higher mix of consignment work versus turnkey 
in addition  the three quick turn businesses test technology  multek and tti testron also carry higher sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales due to the differences in their product lines versus the company s historical product and service offerings 
interest expense increased  to  for fiscal from for fiscal this increase is attributable to the incremental borrowings resulting primarily from the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes in october see liquidity  capital resources and commitments 
amortization expense increased  to  for fiscal from for the fiscal this increase is attributable to the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the convertible subordinated notes issued in october and the amortization of the goodwill associated with the acquisitions 
other income net decreased for fiscal this decrease is substantially related to the recovery in fiscal of receivables written off in prior years offset by net gains on sales of property  plant and equipment and foreign currency transactions in fiscal as compared to net losses on foreign currency transactions in fiscal the company recognized non recurring charges in the fourth quarter of totaling  which was comprised of i aggregate inventory write offs of  ii aggregate receivable write offs of  iii aggregate equity investments write offs of approximately  and iv miscellaneous provisions of the  of charge offs were primarily attributable to the operations of the dovatron operation located in colorado 
the  includes a one time charge of  associated with a write down of assets relating to contracts with two undercapitalized start up companies whose plans to strengthen their capital positions were continually delayed 
the  represents substantially all of the company s assets relating to these two accounts  including which related primarily to the write off of equity investments in the two start up companies 
in addition  the company recorded a  adjustment to inventory during the fourth quarter of this adjustment related to the following components inventory shrink of  overstatement of labor and overhead included in work in progress of  inventory purchases in excess of committed sales price of  and excess and obsolete inventory of although management believes that the substantial majority of the  adjustment relates to fiscal  management is unable to determine how much of this adjustment relates to prior quarters versus the fourth quarter of in addition  management was unable to identify the exact cause of the inventory shrink and excess and obsolete inventory adjustments but believes the primary causes could include scrap incurred during the manufacturing process in excess of historical experience  purchasing inventory in excess of firm purchase orders  and inventory which may have been lost or stolen during the fourth quarter relocation of dovatron s colorado facility 
the identification and income statement recognition of the amount of the adjustment applicable to earlier quarters may impact the comparability of the quarterly information 
foreign and domestic income from operations before income taxes and extraordinary item amounted to  and  for fiscal  respectively 
tax credits and this mix of foreign and domestic income from operations before income taxes and extraordinary item and tax credits resulted in a consolidated tax expense of  for fiscal foreign and domestic income from operations before income taxes and extraordinary item amounted to  and  for fiscal  respectively 
this mix of foreign and domestic income management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dollars in thousands  except per share data operating results fiscal compared to fiscal continued from continuing operations before income taxes and extraordinary item resulted in a consolidated tax expense of  for fiscal the fourth quarter includes an extraordinary non cash write off of the unamortized historical debt issuance costs of  net of tax  resulting from the early extinguishment of debt see liquidity  capital resources and commitments 
liquidity  capital resources and commitments at december   the company had working capital of  and a current ratio of compared to working capital of  and a current ratio of at december  cash and cash equivalents at december  were  a decrease of  from  at december  this decrease resulted from cash used by investing and financing activities of  and  respectively  offset by cash provided by operating activities of  net cash flows used by investing activities amounted to  and  in fiscal and  respectively
