in parimutuel wagering  patrons bet against each other rather than against the operator of the facility or with pre set odds 
the dollars wagered form a pool of funds from which winnings are paid based on odds determined solely by the wagering activity 
the racetrack acts as a stakeholder for the wagering patrons and deducts from the amounts wagered a take out or gross commission  from which the racetrack pays state and county taxes and racing purses 
the company s parimutuel commission rates are fixed as a percentage of the total handle or amounts wagered 
with respect to mountaineer park s live racing operations  such percentage is fixed by west virginia law at three levels   and  depending on the complexity of the wager 
the lower rate applies to wagering pools involving only win  place and show wagers while the higher rates apply to pools involving wagers on specified multiple events  such as trifecta  quinella and perfecta wagers

the lodge and its food and beverage operations are operated in combination with its entertainment facilities and are utilized principally to increase racing attendance and video lottery play 
accordingly  the company maintains inexpensive room rates 
improvement plan and expanded operations since its acquisition of mountaineer in december  the company has been engaged in an ongoing effort to renovate and  more recently  enhance and expand mountaineer park  which was first opened in prior to west virginia s adoption of the lottery act in march  the company completed certain renovations necessary to maintain the clubhouse and lower grandstand areas  including upgrades to the plumbing and electrical systems  the installation of new furniture and furnishings and the redesign of the grandstand parimutuel wagering windows 
these improvements were made during in  the company commenced its capital improvement program  designed to upgrade and expand mountaineer park s existing facilities to a level which would allow its marketing as a more upscale gaming  racing  and recreational destination resort 
in and  the company invested million in building improvements  furnishings  fixtures and equipment suitable for large scale gaming activities in its race track grandstand and clubhouse  and an additional  to convert a portion of existing lodge space to gaming areas 
in response to increased patronage at its lodge gaming areas  the company embarked upon an  square foot expansion of the lodge video lottery facilities in mountaineer has expanded its off track betting facilities in both the racetrack and lodge locations 
in and  the company invested million in two track side restaurants offering seating for  racing patrons  with new inch television monitors located at each table  and a total of overhead monitors with inch screens 
a simulcast control center is located in the clubhouse restaurant  which also offers video and graphic overlay capabilities 
this system enables the company to promote upcoming events and mountaineer s other entertainment facilities  in addition to the day s live and off track racing schedule 
in  the company completed the renovation of the lodge off track betting facility  offering seating for patrons in the speakeasy gaming saloon 
the lodge simulcasting facility is served by inch television monitors  as well as a foot projection screen 
the company currently has available mutuel windows in the racetrack facility and six windows in the speakeasy gaming saloon 
the company also created a boxing arena and entertainment stage  which it has integrated into the grandstand seating 
the stage is an integral component of the company s efforts to expand mountaineer park s customer base by offering new  complementary forms of entertainment 
mountaineer has hosted concerts and six boxing events since december  including nationally televised bouts on espn and usa cable 
mountaineer paid fixed fees and provided certain lodging at no charge to the event promoters 
mountaineer retained all proceeds from ticket sales  food and beverage sales and program sales 
management intends to engage in similar events to increase public awareness and thereby help to increase future attendance at mountaineer park 
the lodge lobby and reception area were renovated in  followed by restoration of guest rooms damaged by fire and a general renovation and upgrade of the common areas in in  enhancements and expansion of the speakeasy gaming saloon  parking lot expansion and portions of general paving were completed 
business strategy the company s business strategy is to increase revenues in all areas of operations through the promotion and expansion of its video lottery business and the enhancement of its racing and entertainment facilities 
develop and market mountaineer as a diversified entertainment facility the company believes that in the past the potential of the mountaineer park racetrack facility has not been maximized 
use of the facility solely to conduct parimutuel racing limited the facility s customer base and under utilized its sizable infrastructure during non racing times 
the expansion of video lottery operations and the introduction of such diverse uses as bingo for local senior citizen groups  concerts  and live and simulcast boxing events at mountaineer park will provide the right product mix to attract an increasing number of visitors and more efficiently use mountaineer s facilities during non racing times 
it is anticipated that the resulting benefits will be shared by parimutuel  as well as by video lottery and other entertainment operations  since patrons who traditionally do not visit horse racetracks may  once at mountaineer park  be more inclined to wager on racing 
in addition  because a significant percentage of revenues from video lottery operations must be contributed to the racing purse fund  as video lottery revenues increase  so will the size of purses 
management believes that this will have the effect of attracting better quality racehorses  further enhancing mountaineer park s appeal to traditional horse racing fans who largely generate the company s parimutuel revenues 
expand video lottery operations at december   the company planned to expand its video lottery operations by installing an additional vlts  which were authorized by the lottery commission in  to replace existing vlts which had been placed in operation in by march   the company had accomplished its plan by removing older card terminals and adding new slot terminals  resulting in an increase in the number of vlts in operation from to  consisting of slot terminals and card terminals 
the company believes that its video lottery revenues will continue to increase with the installation of new machines  the implementation of progressive and video slot games  and the implementation of its expanded marketing plan 
with its current involvement in video lottery gaming and parimutuel racing  its substantial infrastructure and grounds  and the attractive location of its facility  management believes that mountaineer is positioned to take advantage of any forms of gaming which may be legalized in west virginia 
there can be no assurances  however  that the state of west virginia will in the future authorize additional gaming activities or that  if authorized  mountaineer would be permitted to offer such gaming activities 
relocate and improve off track wagering operations the company relocated its primary simulcasting operations to the speakeasy gaming saloon at the lodge and expanded clubhouse simulcast facilities in improvements to simulcasting operations at the riverside gaming terrace were completed in management believes that by exposing video lottery patrons to simulcast and live racing  new racing fans can be developed  thereby increasing parimutuel operations 
the expanded clubhouse and improved riverside gaming terrace simulcast facilities are also expected to create additional excitement and increase the level of activity at the racetrack on live race days 
improve live racing product the company s ability to attract attendance at mountaineer and wagering on its live races is dependent  in part  upon the quality of the horses racing at mountaineer 
horse races at racetracks competing with mountaineer  and at the racetracks from which mountaineer receives import simulcasts  have often been of higher quality than mountaineer s horse races  thereby attracting a larger volume of wagering and higher average wagers than at mountaineer park 
beginning in october  mountaineer has been able to attract better quality horses by paying incrementally higher purses 
average daily purses  which were  in the third quarter of  were increased several times during and to a high of approximately  in the third and fourth quarters of mountaineer reduced daily purses to approximately  late in the fourth quarter of  with the intention of raising them above the  level in the second quarter of the increased purses reflect an increase in the minimum daily purses guaranteed pursuant to mountaineer s agreement with the horsemen s association  a non union entity which represents the horsemen in their dealings with mountaineer 
management s ability to increase further the size of purses will depend on increased video lottery operations and  to a lesser extent  expanded simulcast racing operations 
mountaineer anticipates that it will be able to continue increasing purse sizes to levels attractive to owners of mid level or better quality racehorses 
management has sponsored several stakes races in  with purses of up to  per race 
in september  mountaineer hosted the west virginia breeders classics stakes races  with purses totaling  funded by state wide video lottery tax revenue 
mountaineer broadcast certain of these races to a number of other racetracks around the country and  subject to clarification by the west virginia legislature of the applicable simulcast statute  intends to simulcast its regular card of live races commencing in the fourth quarter of wagering handles from participating racetracks would be aggregated with mountaineer s on site wagering handle when it exports its simulcast signal 
commence export simulcasting outside hub area export simulcasting is a highly desirable source of revenue because the direct costs associated with such operations are relatively low 
mountaineer believes that the higher average purses anticipated from video lottery contributions will improve the quality of races which it can export to other racetracks  off track betting facilities  casinos and other gaming establishments once it has completed its improvement plan 
in order to make its races more attractive to simulcast outlets  mountaineer anticipates that it will experiment with different post times  possibly adopting more evening racing days which are preferable because they do not compete with live racing conducted by other host tracks 
although the company intends to pursue export simulcasting possibilities vigorously  there can be no assurance that such opportunities will prove realistic or that the company will be successful in its pursuit of such business 
increasing import simulcasting the company intends to increase the number and quality of races it makes available for wagering by simulcasting additional out of state races 
although management does not anticipate that it will increase the number of import signals it can receive simultaneously  it will increase the number of races displayed with each available signal 
in may  mountaineer introduced simulcasts of off track greyhound racing  and has since offered thoroughbred and or greyhound import simulcasting seven days per week 
because operating expenses associated with simulcast racing are generally lower than those associated with live racing  management believes that increases in the levels of simulcast wagering would result in greater operating profits than similar increases in live racing levels 
marketing mountaineer s primary market includes four million persons of gaming age who reside within a one hour drive  or approximately miles  of the facility  including the population centers of pittsburgh  pennsylvania  youngstown warren and akron canton  ohio  and wheeling  west virginia 
a secondary market of million persons of gaming age reside within a two hour drive  including cleveland  ohio and morgantown  west virginia 
both markets have an average household income of approximately  the company has adopted and implemented a comprehensive marketing program to capitalize on mountaineer s recently expanded gaming facilities to create a larger and more loyal customer base 
the program includes i the players club  a player rating and tracking system designed to reward qualified play through the issuance of reward certificates which are redeemable for food and beverages  merchandise and other services  ii entertainment programming featuring boxing and other special events  iii attractive food and beverage pricing  iv comprehensive advertising  and v a bus program 
some features of the program are subject to approval by the lottery commission 
prior to the formulation of the new marketing program  the company s marketing efforts consisted of limited television  radio and print advertising and promotional events tied to major holidays or horse racing events 
in november  mountaineer s proposal for a  direct advertising grant from the state of west virginia was approved 
mountaineer matched the amount of the grant and utilized the funds to produce an infomercial entitled hancock county the action s closer than you think 
the infomercial is scheduled to air from january  through august   three times per day  seven days per week over cable networks in mountaineer s target markets of cleveland  akron  canton and youngstown  ohio and pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
the company believes that the infomercial will assist in generating additional video lottery patronage and revenues and help temper the decrease of revenues which is typically associated with horse racing at mountaineer during the winter months 
competition mountaineer s principal direct competitors are wheeling downs  located approximately miles to the south in wheeling  west virginia and thistledown  located approximately miles to the northwest in cleveland  ohio 
wheeling downs conducts parimutuel greyhound dog racing and video lottery gaming 
thistledown conducts parimutuel thoroughbred horse racing  but not video lottery 
other than wheeling downs and thistledown  there are currently no facilities offering competitive parimutuel live thoroughbred or video lottery gaming within a mile radius of mountaineer park 
as a result  although there are facilities located more than miles away  management does not believe that such other facilities compete with mountaineer park for a significant segment of its target customer base although they do compete to some extent for quality racehorses 
in addition  none of those facilities  all of which are located in pennsylvania and ohio  are currently licensed to offer video lottery gaming 
the one facility in west virginia  other than mountaineer and wheeling downs  currently offering video lottery is located in the central part of the state and  as a result  management believes it does not compete to any significant extent with mountaineer for customers 
the company understands that a track in charles town  west virginia intends to offer live thoroughbred racing  import simulcast racing  and video lottery gaming in mid that facility is located more than miles from mountaineer 
accordingly  the company does not believe that facility will compete with mountaineer 
one other well known resort located downstate has sought legislative approval to operate a land based casino 
the company also competes with statewide lotteries in west virginia  pennsylvania and ohio  on site and off track wagering in pennsylvania and other entertainment options available to consumers  including live and televised professional and collegiate major sports events 
the company will also compete with off track wagering in ohio  which was approved in the company is attempting to attract patrons by promoting mountaineer as a complete entertainment complex and destination resort offering a unique combination of quality racing  video lottery wagering  dining  special events and other entertainment options  all in a physically attractive setting which is easily accessed with ample on site parking 
to the extent that pennsylvania or ohio legalize any forms of casino gaming  the company s video lottery operations will compete with new gaming facilities located within driving distances from mountaineer s geographic market 
such facilities may offer more gaming machines than mountaineer as well as forms of gaming not available in west virginia 
employees as of december   mountaineer had approximately full time employees and part time employees  of whom approximately were represented by a labor union under a collective bargaining agreement 
the union representing mutuel clerks at the race track has been expanded in recent years to cover certain employees providing off track betting services at the lodge 
on february   the collective bargaining agreement was extended until september  in september  a vote was held on a proposal to make approximately other mountaineer employees members of an additional collective bargaining unit 
based on information available to the company  management believes that the vote on this proposal to expand union coverage at mountaineer was against and for  with votes challenged and under review for eligibility 
pending the outcome of such review  the company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the vote 
as of december   the company also employed two persons in orange county  california 
the company believes that its employee relations are good  however  there can be no assurance that if such expansion of the union is approved  the company s employee relations will remain on the same terms as in the past 
regulation and licensing racing the company s horse racing operations are subject to extensive regulation by the racing commission  which is responsible for  among other things  granting annual licenses to conduct race meets  approving simulcasting post times  and other matters 
when granting licenses  the racing commission has the authority to determine the dates on which mountaineer may conduct races 
in order to conduct simulcast racing  mountaineer is required under west virginia law to hold a minimum of live race days each year 
mountaineer was granted a license to conduct live race days for west virginia law requires that at least of mountaineer s employees must be citizens and residents of west virginia and must have been such for at least one year 
in addition  certain activities  such as simulcasting races  require the consent of the representatives of a majority of the horse owners and trainers at mountaineer 
mountaineer s revenues from live racing operations are derived substantially from its parimutuel commissions  which are fixed by the state of west virginia as percentages of mountaineer s wagering handles 
the west virginia legislature could change these percentages at any time  although the company is not aware of any current proposal to do so 
the company s simulcast activities that occur outside of west virginia could be subject to regulation by other state racing commissions  as well as the provisions of the federal interstate horse racing act of  which prohibits mountaineer from accepting off track wagering on simulcast racing without the approval of the racing commission and  subject to certain exceptions  of any other currently operating track within miles  or if none  of the closest track in any adjoining state

under the terms of the agreement  the company retained ownership or control of the video lottery machines and other equipment it provided for use in video lottery gaming 
in march  the attorney general of west virginia issued an opinion that  under the west virginia constitution  video lottery machines could not be privately owned 
as a result of the attorney general s opinion  the company was unable to renew its agreement with the lottery commission  which was scheduled to expire in june in october  the supreme court of west virginia found that the legislature had not adequately defined and authorized video lottery gaming and  as a result  the lottery commission s authorization of video lottery gaming at mountaineer was invalid 
the court s order was to become effective in late november  at which time video lottery gaming at mountaineer would have had to terminate 
however  the court stayed its order pending consideration and passage of satisfactory video lottery legislation 
the subsequent adoption of the lottery act has not been contested in or otherwise addressed by the court or any other west virginia court 
under the lottery act  only parimutuel horse or dog racing facilities that were licensed by the racing commission prior to january  and that conduct at least live racing dates for each dog or horse race meeting  or such other number as may be approved by the racing commission  are eligible for licensure to operate video lottery games 
there are four racing facilities in west virginia two horse racing and two dog racing  including mountaineer  three of which satisfy the eligibility requirements of the conduct of video lottery gaming by a racing facility is subject to the approval of the voters of the county in which the facility is located 
if such approval is obtained  the facilities may continue to conduct racing activities unless the matter is resubmitted to the voters pursuant to a petition signed by at least of the registered voters  who must wait at least five years to bring such a petition 
if approval is denied  another election on the issue may not be held for a period of two years 
video lottery gaming was approved in hancock county  the location of mountaineer park  on may  in order to qualify as a video lottery game  as the term is defined under the lottery act  a game must  among other things  be a game of chance which utilizes an interactive electronic terminal device allowing input by an individual player

the licensing application procedures are extensive and include inquiries into and an evaluation of the character  background including criminal record  reputation and associations  business ability and experience of an applicant and the adequacy and source of the applicant s financing arrangements 
in addition  a racetrack applicant must hold a valid racing license  have an agreement regarding video lottery revenues with the representatives of a majority of the horsemen  the parimutuel clerks and the breeders for the racetrack and post a bond or irrevocable letter of credit in such amount as the lottery commission shall determine 
finally  no license will be granted until the lottery commission determines that each person who has control of an applicant meets all of the applicable licensing qualifications

the company s license application was approved by the lottery commission in june from march until such approval  the company conducted video lottery gaming under a provision of the lottery act that permitted any racetrack authorized by the lottery commission to conduct video lottery gaming prior to november  to continue to do so for a limited time without additional licensure 
prior to mountaineer s loan with bennett  the lottery commission approved the company s license in september  during the relicensing proceedings prior to july   the lottery commission required bennett to submit audited financial statements  based on the combined effect of bennett s stock ownership in the company  its security interest pursuant to the deed of trust in connection with the bennett loan  and the fact that agel  bennett s affiliate  performed management services for the company 
these factors required the company to seek lottery commission approval of bennett 
although bennett failed to initially provide information required by the lottery commission  the lottery commission relicensed mountaineer in june   after which time bennett supplied the requisite information 
in connection with the relicensing proceedings held in june  the lottery commission released a letter opinion dated may  to the effect that because bennett had the right to vote less than of the outstanding stock the company  and agel  an affiliate of bennett  was no longer providing management services  bennett could not influence or control mountaineer s business  and thus  lottery commission approval was not required 
accordingly  no lottery commission approval of bennett was required in on december   mountaineer prepaid the bennett loan with funds obtained through a new financing from madeleine llc because the terms of the new financing provide that madeleine does not have the right to vote more than of the company s voting stock or the right to take an active role in the affairs of mountaineer  no lottery commission approval of madeleine was required in while the company has no reason to believe that its license will be affected by either loan  a change in policy by the lottery commission could affect mountaineer s license and thus adversely affect the company 
licenses granted by the lottery commission must be renewed on july of each year 
a license to operate video lottery games is a privilege personal to the license holder and  accordingly  is non transferable 
in order for a license to remain in effect  lottery commission approval is required prior to any change of ownership or control of a license holder 
unless prior approval of the lottery commission is obtained  the sale of five percent or more of the voting stock of the license holder or any corporation that controls the license holder or the sale of a license holder s assets other than in the ordinary course of business  or any interest therein  to any person not previously determined by the lottery commission to have satisfied the licensing qualifications voids the license 
once licensed  a racetrack has the right to install and operate up to video lottery machines and may operate more than machines only upon lottery commission approval 
the company has received approval to operate a total of  machines 
video lottery machines may only be operated in the areas of the racetrack where parimutuel wagering is permitted  provided  however  that if a racetrack was authorized by the lottery commission prior to november  to operate video lottery machines in another area of the racetrack s facilities  such racetrack may continue to do so as long as there is one video lottery machine in the parimutuel wagering area for each machine located in another area of the racetrack 
accordingly  the company may continue to operate video lottery machines at the lodge  provided that there are at least as many machines located at mountaineer s racetrack 
the lottery act imposes extensive operational controls relating to  among other matters  security and supervision  access to the machines  hours of operation  general liability insurance coverage and machine location 
in addition  the lottery act prohibits the extension of credit for video lottery play and requires lottery commission approval before any video lottery advertising and promotional activities are conducted 
the lottery act provides for criminal and civil liability in the event of specified violations 
all revenues derived from the operation of video lottery games must be deposited with the lottery commission to be shared in accordance with the provisions of the lottery act 
under such provisions  each racetrack must electronically remit to the lottery commission its gross terminal income total cash deposited into video lottery machines less the value of credits cleared for winning redemption tickets 
to ensure the availability of such funds to the lottery commission  each racetrack must maintain in its account an amount equal to or greater than the gross terminal income to be remitted 
if a racetrack fails to maintain this balance  the lottery commission may disable all of the racetrack s video lottery machines until full payment of all amounts due is made 
from the gross terminal income remitted by a licensee  the lottery commission will deduct up to to cover its costs of administering video lottery at the licensee s racetrack and divide the remaining amounts as follows is returned to the racetrack  is paid to the state s general revenue fund  is deposited in the racetrack s fund for the payment of purses  and the remaining is divided among tourism promotion  hancock county  the breeders  classics  the veterans memorial program and the racetrack employees pension fund 
pursuant to both the racing commission s and lottery commission s regulatory authority  the company may be investigated by either body at virtually any time 
accordingly  the company must comply with all gaming laws at all times 
should either body consider the company to be in violation of any of the applicable laws or regulations  each has the plenary authority to suspend or rescind the company s licenses 
while the company has no knowledge of any non compliance  and believes that it is in full compliance with all relevant regulations  should the company fail to comply  its business would be materially adversely effected 
to date  the company has obtained all governmental licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals necessary for the operation of its current gaming activities 
however  no assurances can be given that any new licenses or approvals that may be required in the future will be given or that existing ones will be renewed 
management is aware of nothing to indicate that west virginia state officials will change their policies toward gaming activities  particularly video lottery gaming  however  there are no assurances that such policies will not be changed 
any substantial unfavorable change in the enabling laws or tax rates on gaming revenues could make the company s business substantially more onerous  less profitable or illegal  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business

the emergence of video lottery as mountaineer s dominant profit center and the amendment of the west virginia video lottery law to permit the addition of simulated classic casino slot machine games to video lottery terminals slot terminals have significantly moderated the seasonality experienced in prior year revenue trends 
as a result of this significant increase in gaming revenues  the company earned a million profit from continuing operations in the company incurred significant losses from continuing operations during the years ended december  and largely due to delays encountered in the expansion of mountaineer s video lottery operations as a result of i the state attorney general s challenge of mountaineer s contract with the lottery commission  ii the state supreme court s ruling that video lottery was unconstitutional pending the passage of proper enabling legislation  and iii time required for the passage of such legislation

in october  the company s shareholders approved an amendment to the company s certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the company s common stock from million to million 
the purpose of this amendment is to provide a sufficient number of shares for the company to honor its obligations to issue shares of common stock under various agreements and to be used for corporate purposes in the future

the net additional vlts are housed within mountaineer s existing gaming facilities

outlook the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results could differ materially 
the company believes that the major challenges in seeking legislation for and establishing a market for the company s video lottery operations  from which the company derives the bulk of its revenues  are behind it 
management expects that gross handle and net win gross handle less payouts to patrons from video lottery operations will continue to increase in fiscal year  primarily as a result of the company s infomercial and other advertising  the increase from to  vlts  including the increase from to of those vlts to slot terminals 
these increased revenues  in turn  should permit the company to continue increasing its live racing purses and thus improve the quality of its live racing product and permit the company to sell its signal for simulcasting by other tracks and off track betting facilities  which is a source of revenue the company has never had 
any material unfavorable change in west virginia video lottery laws or the rates at which such operations are taxed or otherwise assessed  as well as competition in the event ohio or pennsylvania determine to permit video lottery or other new forms of gaming  could materially affect the company s results 
by the same token  any favorable changes in the video lottery law or regulations such as coin out  increased betting limits  or progressive jackpots would likely improve the company s results 
there can also be no assurance that the company will be able to profitably market its racing product for export simulcasting 
the company also plans to continue to diversify mountaineer s sources of revenue through live concerts  boxing  and other entertainment events 
the company also hopes to enhance the revenues and profitability of mountaineer by constructing to additional hotel rooms  a small convention facility and perhaps a bowling alley 
management believes that this additional capacity would permit the company to increase its weekday business 
many factors  including but not limited to securing financing  attracting additional employees  loan covenants  competition  and general economic conditions affecting the resort business could materially affect management s decision and or ability to carry out such expansion 
in addition to plans for enhancing or expanding operations at mountaineer  the company is actively seeking other gaming and entertainment opportunities 
management is particularly interested in projects that would permit the company to duplicate its speakeasy gaming saloon concept  incorporating either video lottery or other forms of gaming 
there are few such opportunities  however  and the company will be competing with larger  more experienced gaming companies which have more capital for acquisitions 
the company s ability to consummate such acquisitions could also be limited by restrictions contained in the company s agreements with its lenders
