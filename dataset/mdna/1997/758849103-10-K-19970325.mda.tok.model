adjustments for investments in real estate partnerships are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo as defined above has become a measure used by many industry analysts  however  ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

the company modified its definition of ffo for these changes effective january  and has also restated amounts reported for and for comparison purposes 
environmental matters the company like others in the commercial real estate industry  is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and the operation of dry cleaning plants at the company s shopping centers is the principal environmental concern 
the company believes that the dry cleaners are operating in accordance with current laws and regulations and has established procedures to monitor their operations 
based on information presently available  no additional environmental accruals were made and management believes that the ultimate disposition of currently known matters will not have a material effect on the financial position  liquidity  or operations of the company 
environmental matters are discussed further in note  contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
economic conditions a substantial number of the company s long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on the company s net income 
such provisions include percentage rentals  rental escalation clauses and reimbursements for common area maintenance  insurance  and real estate taxes 
in addition  of the company s leases have terms of five years or less  which allows the company the opportunity to increase rents upon lease expiration 
approximately of the company s leases expire beyond years and are generally anchor tenants 
unfavorable economic conditions could result in the inability of certain tenants to meet their lease obligations and otherwise could adversely affect the company s ability to attract and retain desirable tenants 
during  discovery zone dz filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws 
dz had two leases with the company  both of which have been terminated and no longer pay rent 
dz s annualized minimum rent represented approximately 
of minimum rent reported by the company 
luria s currently has three leases with the company  one store of which was closed during  but continued to pay rent 
during  luria s defaulted on the lease of the closed store and informed the company that it intends to close its remaining two stores during minimum rent from the three luria s leases represents approximately of total minimum rent reported by the company 
the three leases with luria s expire beyond  and the company considers luria s to be bound by the lease terms 
at december  approximately   and of the company s annualized rent is received from publix  winn dixie  wal mart and kroger  respectively the four major tenants 
during no tenant had rents in excess of of the company s minimum rent 
in february   wal mart closed its store located at the marketplace in alexander city  alabama in order to relocate to a new larger store nearby 
wal mart will continue to pay rent due under its lease at the marketplace which expires in october  the marketplace is anchored by a winn dixie which opened during although the company considers the financial condition and its relationship with the four major tenants to be very solid  a significant downturn in business or the non renewal of expiring leases of the four major tenants could adversely affect the company 
management also believes that the shopping centers are relatively well positioned to withstand adverse economic conditions since they are typically anchored by supermarkets  drug stores and discount department stores that offer day to day necessities rather than luxury goods
