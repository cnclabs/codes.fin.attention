fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues from the new restaurants which opened during accounted for million of the increase 
the balance of the increase primarily resulted from the restaurants opened during contributing a full year of sales in  as comparable restaurant sales were flat for the year 
when computing comparable restaurant sales  restaurants open for at least six full quarters are compared from year to year 
revenues from the company s rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants  as a percentage of total revenues  increased slightly to in from in although the company opened only four rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants during the last months as compared to old chicago restaurants  the brewery restaurants generate greater average weekly sales aws resulting in the increase to this percentage 
the company expects revenues from the rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants to comprise an even greater percentage of the company s total revenues in as the brewery restaurants represent half of total restaurant openings planned for aws for the rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants during were  as compared to  during fiscal the decrease in aws of  is due primarily to the impact the company s restaurant in denver has on the aws computation 
this restaurant generates aws of approximately  as compared to the company s targeted restaurant model of  in aws 
due to additional restaurant openings  this restaurant contributed only approximately to total brewery revenues in as compared to approximately of total brewery revenues in aws during for the old chicago restaurants were  as compared to  during fiscal the decrease in aws of  is due primarily to six restaurants that generate aws below the company s targeted restaurant model 
these restaurants  all of which were opened or selected for opening during  incurred aws of  during as compared to  during the company is implementing various marketing programs for these restaurants during to increase sales back to their levels 
these programs include a direct mail campaign with discounted food specials to promote early week sales  and re merchandising the menu in certain markets to encourage trial of the restaurants traditional pizzas and domestic beers 
cost of sales 
cost of sales  which consists of food  beverage and merchandise costs  increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  but decreased slightly as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal although the company experienced significant increases in certain commodity prices during the latter part of the second quarter and into the third quarter of  particularly cheese and chicken  these cost increases were offset by increased purchasing efficiencies  and increased training and development of the restaurant management to focus on controlling food and beverage waste and yields 
commodity prices for cheese and chicken have since returned to their pre inflation levels  and the company currently does not anticipate any significant increases in these prices during the first half of restaurant salaries and benefits 
restaurant salaries and benefits  which consist of restaurant management and hourly employee wages  payroll taxes  and group health insurance  increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year such salaries and benefits decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in this decrease is due primarily to sophisticated labor scheduling systems installed in the rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants during the last part of and early  and procedures implemented in the old chicago restaurants during the first part of to address labor scheduling on a more real time basis 
although the company also anticipates upgrading labor scheduling software currently used in the old chicago restaurants  implementation is now targeted for the first half of due to delays from the vendor in releasing the product 
the new software is intended to computerize some of the manual procedures now performed 
operating expenses 
operating expenses  which include occupancy costs  utilities  repairs  maintenance and linen  increased million to million in fiscal year from million for fiscal year as a percentage of revenues  such expenses increased to in from in this increase is primarily a result of higher occupancy costs including an increase in the level of insurance coverage carried by the company  higher property taxes in certain markets and increases in certain fixed costs as a percentage of revenues due to decreases in aws for both concepts

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization  including amortization of preopening expenses  increased million to million for fiscal year from million in fiscal year as a percentage of revenues  depreciation expense was during as compared to in  and preopening expense was in as compared to in the increase in depreciation expense as a percentage of revenues is attributable primarily to two old chicago restaurants and three rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants opened during the last part of these restaurants experienced higher construction costs than restaurants opened prior to july  including land and building purchases for three of these restaurants 
as construction costs for restaurants opened in have been consistent with management s estimates  the company does not anticipate significant future increases in depreciation expense as a percentage of revenues 
the increase in preopening expense as a percentage of revenues is attributable primarily to an increase in average preopening costs for certain old chicago restaurants 
this increase is principally due to opening restaurants in new markets outside of colorado  which requires a greater investment for travel expense  training and other personnel related costs 
although the company does not anticipate preopening expense as a percentage of revenues to continue to increase significantly  the percentage will fluctuate depending on the number and location of new restaurants opened in any given period 
equity in joint venture earnings 
the equity in joint venture earnings represents the company s equity interest in trolley barn s net after tax earnings 
interest expense interest income 
interest expense for the year ended december   increased  from additionally  interest expense of approximately  was capitalized to construction costs

the provision for income taxes reflects utilization of approximately million in tax credits attributable to fica tax paid on certain tips to hourly restaurant employees the fica credit  and to rehabilitation costs incurred for certain owned restaurant property in chicago 
the tax provision included a fica credit of only approximately  these credits in both years reduced the effective combined federal and state tax rate 
as of december   the company had tax credits available totaling million to reduce income taxes payable in future years 
due to alternative minimum tax limitations and the relatively volatile nature of the restaurant industry  the company recorded a valuation allowance in for approximately of these credits 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues from the new restaurants which opened in  and from the rock bottom restaurant brewery and two old chicago restaurants which opened in december  accounted for million of the increase 
the balance of the increase resulted from the remaining five restaurants opened during contributing a full year of sales in  offset by a less than decrease in comparable restaurant sales 
revenues for the rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants  as a percentage of total revenues  increased from in to in due to opening five additional restaurants during aws for the rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants during were  as compared to  during fiscal the decrease in aws of  is due primarily to the impact the company s restaurant in denver has on the aws computation 
this restaurant generates aws of approximately  as compared to the company s targeted restaurant model of  in aws 
due to additional restaurant openings  this restaurant contributed approximately to total brewery revenues in as compared to approximately of total brewery revenues in aws during for the old chicago restaurants were  as compared to  during fiscal the decrease in aws of  was due primarily to the five new restaurants opened during these restaurants experienced a substantial honeymoon period in at which time aws exceeded the company s expectations 
during  aws from these restaurants decreased approximately  which represented a return to sales levels consistent with management s expectations 
cost of sales 
cost of sales  which consists of food  beverage and merchandise costs  increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  but decreased slightly as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal from in the fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues contributed from rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants 
beer brewed on premises at these restaurants has a lower cost of sales than other beverages and food products purchased by the company 
increased purchasing efficiencies also contributed to the decrease  however  this savings was offset somewhat by inefficient food inventory utilization at certain of the company s newer restaurants and increases in certain commodity prices 
food inventory utilization issues due to less experienced management at a number of new restaurants and price increases were much more significant in the fourth quarter of than in other quarters resulting in total cost of sales as a percentage of revenues of during that quarter 
restaurant salaries and benefits 
restaurant salaries and benefits  which consist of restaurant management and hourly employee wages  payroll taxes  and group health insurance  increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year such salaries and benefits increased as a percentage of revenues from in to in these increases are due primarily to the significant increase in the number of new restaurants which tend to experience higher labor costs in their first several months of operations 
with almost two thirds of the new restaurants opening in the second half of  the cost as a percentage of revenues was highest in the fourth quarter 
as the base of mature restaurants begins to increase  the company expects this percentage to decrease over time 
operating expenses 
operating expenses  which include occupancy costs  utilities  repairs  maintenance and linen  increased million to million in fiscal year from million for fiscal year as a percentage of revenues  such expenses decreased slightly to in from in due to improved lease rates  lower occupancy costs for the restaurants where the company has purchased the land and building and reduced repair and maintenance costs as a percentage of revenues 
the reduction in repairs and maintenance is primarily due to the increase in the number of new restaurants which generally experience lower repair costs 
selling expenses 
selling expenses increased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year as a percentage of revenues  these expenses have increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year as the company continues its expansion in colorado and into new markets outside of colorado  emphasis is placed on marketing programs to build name recognition resulting in increases to selling expenses 
such programs included significant gift certificate and radio advertising campaigns in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in selling expenses of as a percentage of revenues during that quarter 
general and administrative g a 
g a expenses increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and decreased slightly as a percentage of revenues from in to in the increase in dollars primarily reflects personnel additions as well as increases in overall corporate infrastructure including office space and supplies  all resulting from the company s continuing expansion program 
because costs associated with these increases are lower in proportion to the revenues added from new restaurants  g a decreased as a percentage of revenues 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization  including amortization of preopening expenses  increased million to million for fiscal year from million in fiscal year as a percentage of revenues  depreciation expense was during as compared to in  and preopening expense was in as compared to in the increase in depreciation expense as a percentage of revenues is due primarily to the restaurants opened during restaurants opened prior to this time experienced a lower average construction cost due to their proximity to the company s colorado market  and correspondingly have a lower depreciation rate 
in addition  as the average age of restaurants opened prior to was in excess of five years  many assets were already fully depreciated 
the increase in preopening expense as a percentage of revenues is principally due to opening a significant number of restaurants in new markets outside of colorado  which requires a greater investment for travel expense  training and other personnel related costs 
although the company does not anticipate preopening expense as a percentage of revenues to continue to increase significantly  the percentage will fluctuate depending on the number and location of new restaurants opened in any given period 
interest income 
the increase in interest income to million in fiscal year from  in fiscal year was attributable to the temporary investment of proceeds received from the company s public offerings in july and march provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes reflects utilization of a  fica credit as compared to only a  fica credit utilized in these fica credits reduce the effective combined federal and state tax rate 
the provision also includes a pro forma provision of  for the period from december  through july  and a provision of  to record cumulative deferred income taxes existing at that date

the company has financed its expansion over the last three years principally through cash flow from operations  proceeds from its public offerings  borrowings on long term debt and capital lease obligations 
net cash used in investing activities during  and included total capital expenditures of million  million and million  respectively

these financing instruments provided cash sources in of million 
during the first quarter of  the company amended the credit facility to increase the maximum borrowing capacity to million 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under the credit facility  and million available under the amended credit facility 
during the third quarter of  the company financed its acquisition of an indirect interest in trolley barn by exchanging  shares of its 
par value common stock 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corresponding increase in assets and equity is excluded from the above cash flows reflecting the non cash nature of this transaction 
the company historically has leased its facilities and plans to lease sites for a majority of its future restaurant locations 
the company has purchased five old chicago restaurant sites and two rock bottom restaurant brewery sites and may purchase additional restaurant sites in the future 
see item properties 
the company estimates that total capital expenditures for  excluding preopening costs and potential real estate purchases  will be approximately million  of which the cost of new restaurants will be approximately million including the two rock bottom restaurant brewery restaurants and the old chicago restaurant opened during the first quarter 
the remaining million is the amount estimated for routine capital expenditures and remodels of existing restaurants  and for other corporate requirements 
the company may continue to seek additional sources of debt or equity capital for its continuing expansion  although there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
the company believes that its existing cash balances  cash flow generated from operations and funds available under the amended credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy its currently anticipated cash needs for fiscal however  results of operations may be affected by changes in consumer tastes  national  regional or local economic conditions  demographic trends and traffic patterns  decreased interest income and increased interest expense  among other factors 
there can also be no assurance that budgeted capital expenditures will be sufficient for current development plans or that the costs of acquiring sites and opening new restaurants will not increase in the future 
the company does not have significant receivables or inventory and receives trade credit based upon negotiated terms in purchasing food and supplies 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s sales and earnings fluctuate seasonally 
historically  the company s highest earnings have occurred in the second and third quarters  but as the company enters new markets  it may encounter different seasonal patterns 
in addition  quarterly results have been and  in the future are likely to be  substantially affected by the timing of new restaurant openings 
specifically  results of operations from new restaurants opening in the first or fourth quarters will experience lower margins initially than new restaurants opening in the second and third quarters 
because of the seasonality of the company s business and the impact of new restaurant openings  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year and cannot be used to indicate financial performance for the entire year 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor and operating expenses could have a significant impact on the company s operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
the company does not believe that inflation has materially affected operating results in any of the past three years
