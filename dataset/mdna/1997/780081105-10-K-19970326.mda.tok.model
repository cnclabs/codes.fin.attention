under this method  provisions for possible loan losses are charged to operation and recognized loan losses are charged and loan recoveries are credited to the allowance 
the allowance for possible loan loss represents the amount set aside to protect against the risk inherent in the bank s portfolio 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance takes into consideration the bank s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  adverse situations which may affect the borrower s ability to repay  overall portfolio quality  and current economic conditions 
provisions for possible loan losses are charged to earnings to bring the allowance to a level considered by management to be appropriate in light of the foregoing considerations 
however  since loan loss reserve adequacy is subjective  the loan loss reserve may be excessively funded or need additional funds from time to time 
a loan review is performed quarterly by the loan review officer to determine the adequacy of the reserves

financial condition total assets decreased million  or to million at december  from million at year end cash and cash equivalents decreased million  or  primarily due to fed funds being reinvested in new loans and investment securities 
total loans increased from million at december  to million at december  investment securities increased million to million at december   an increase of from million at december  the rbpa s primary source of funding  deposits  decreased from million at december  to million at december  this decrease in deposits is primarily due to runoff experienced in money market deposits and certificate of deposits of and million  respectively 
long term borrowings  which are comprised of advances from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh fhlb and a mortgage  increased million due to an additional million fhlb advance taken in january  partially offset by a scheduled maturity of an existing fhlb advance of 
million 
stockholders equity increased million or in to million primarily due to net income of million and million relating to the exercise of employee stock options  partially offset  by a million reduction due to rbpa repurchasing of  shares of class a stock in accordance with a stock buyback program 
additionally  a million decrease was attributable to cash dividends declared and paid in results of operations overview rbpa reported net income of million  in  a increase over the million reported in and increase over the million reported in net income per share was  and 
for   and  respectively 
this increase in net income for is due to a million and million respective increase in net interest income before loan loss provision  and noninterest income  partially offset by a million increase in noninterest expense 
rbpa s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  or the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by market and economic conditions which influence rates and loan and deposit growth 
rbpa s net interest income was million as compared to million in  an increase of million  or primarily due to an increase in interest income of million  or 
this increase is partially offset by a thousand increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income was primarily due an increase in average earning assets of million  in addition to the receipt of a one time interest recovery relating to a loan payoff 
in  net interest income decreased thousand primarily due to a one time recovery income in of million 
without the effect of this one time income of million in  net interest income would have increased approximately million  or in over yield on loans and mortgages average loan outstandings    interest and fees on loans    average yield although rbpa has generated five year fixed rate loans  a portion of the loan portfolio continues to be comprised of variable rate loans which helps to maintain its interest spread when rates change 
rbpa s yields tend to have less of a downward fluctuation when interest rates decline because many of the rbpa s loans have interest rate minimums associated with them 
yields on loans increased basis points in to partially due to an interest recovery relating to a loan payoff in average loans increased million  or in primarily due to an increase in loan originations 
the bank s average prime rate for was versus for in  yields on loans decreased to primarily due to a decrease in accretion income in of approximately million relating to a loan payoff in previously purchased at a significant discount 
this one time income alone contributed basis points to the total yield in the bank s average prime rate for was vs 
for average loans outstanding increased million in from this increase is attributable to the ksb acquisition  partially offset by scheduled maturities and payoffs during investments securities held to maturity average investment securities    interest income    average yield held to maturity htm investment securities are comprised of taxable corporate debt  us treasuries agencies and to a lesser extent  non taxable state municipal investment securities 
the yield on htm investment securities decreased basis points in to primarily due to scheduled maturities of higher yielding taxable bonds which were ultimately replaced by lower yielding taxable bonds 
the average balance of htm investment securities increased million  or 
these purchases in corporate issues were a rated or better by moodys or standard poor  with maturities in the three to five year ranges 
it is rbpa s expressed intention to hold these securities to maturity  as has been the established investment policy 
in  the yield on htm investment securities decreased basis points primarily due to higher yielding taxable bonds which were ultimately replaced by lower yielding bonds as interest rates declined  in addition to significant bond calls experienced in the higher yielding nontaxable bond portfolio 
the average balance of htm investment securities increased million in due to an increase of million in us treasuries and agencies relating to the ksb acquisition  partially offset by nontaxable bond calls of approximately million 
interest expense on now and money market deposits average now money market deposits    interest expense    average cost of funds in  the average cost of funds on now and money market deposits decreased basis points to from as interest rates declined during average cost of funds on now and money market deposits for increased basis points to from for primarily due to the addition of higher costing deposits acquired from ksb 
the average balance of these deposits increased to million in from million in and million in primarily due to the acquisition of ksb in july interest expense on time deposits average time deposits    interest expense    average cost of funds the average balance of time deposits increased million in  while the average cost of funds increased slightly to from in the average balance of time deposits increased million during  primarily due to additional time deposits of approximately million relating to the ksb acquisition  partially offset by significant scheduled maturities experienced during the average cost of funds for time deposits decreased to in from in although rates in general started to move downward in  the reaction of deposits to rate changes both increases and decreases is slower than the change in the prime rate because these time deposits must mature before a rate adjustment would become effective 
in  nineteen percent of time deposits are comprised of certificates of deposit accounts with balances of  or more  which are considered more rate volatile than lower balance deposits  however  the penalty for early redemption somewhat mitigates this volatility 
provision for possible loan losses the provision for loan losses is an amount charged to expense to provide for future losses on existing loans 
in order to determine the amount of the provision for loan loss  rbpa conducts a quarterly review of the loan portfolio to evaluate overall credit quality 
this evaluation consists of an analysis of individual loans and overall risk characteristics and size of the loan  and takes into consideration current economic and market conditions  changes in non performing loans  the capability of specific borrowers to repay loan obligations as well as current collateral values 
due to recoveries exceeding charge offs in  a recovery from the allowance for loan loss of million credit was recorded in this million recovery in was primarily due to management s assessment that the overall level of loan loss reserves is adequate 
charge offs in were million as compared to 
million for recoveries in were million as compared to 
million in the provision charged against income in was compared to million in in  charge offs were 
million compared to 
million in recoveries in were 
million as compared to 
million for the decrease in provision in is primarily due to management s assessment that the overall level of loan loss reserves is adequate 
the allowance for possible loan loss at december  was million  or of total loans  compared to million  or of total loans at december   and million  or of total loans at december non interest income non interest income includes service charges on depositors accounts  safe deposit rentals and various services such as cashing checks  issuing money orders and travelers checks  redeeming us savings bonds and similar activities 
most components of non interest income are a modest and stable source of income  with exceptions of one time gains and losses from the sale of other real estate owned  from period to period these sources of income may vary considerably 
service charges on depositors accounts  safe deposit rentals and other fees are periodically reviewed by management to remain competitive with other local banks 
non interest income increased million  or  in to million as compared to million in this increase is primarily due to gains experienced on the sale of other real estate owned of million  and to a lesser extent  an increase in gains on sale of loans of 
million  and service fees and commissions of 
million 
total non interest income in was million as compared to million for this decrease of 
million in is attributable to a decline in gains on sale of other real estate 
the amount included a one time  pre tax gain of million from the sale of various other real estate 
this activity is primarily due to the management aggressively concentrating on the disposal of its portfolio of other real estate during and loans are transferred into other real estate when the bank forecloses on the real estate collateralizing a non performing loan  or when the borrower abandons the property and the bank elects to assume control of the property 
when this occurs the bank will transfer the loan to other real estate at the lower of the book value of the loan or the fair market value  less disposal costs  of the real estate held as collateral 
service charge income increased thousand in  or as compared to primarily due to additional fee income associated with the ksb acquisition in non interest expense non interest expense includes compensation and employee benefits  occupancy  advertising  fdic insurance  state taxes  depreciation  and other expenses such as auditing  automatic teller machines atms  data processing  legal  outside service charges  postage  printing  and other expenses relating to other real estate owned 
total non interest expense increased million in to million primarily due to an increase in salaries  wages and employee benefits of million  reflecting the addition of new employees relating to the ksb acquisition in addition to an expense recorded relating to the establishment of a liability for the stock option and appreciation right plan 
the company has a stock option and appreciation right plan which provides employees compensation in the form of options to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
at the time an option is granted  an identical number of stock appreciation rights are granted  which enable the recipient on exercise  to receive payment in cash of increases in the market value of the stock from the date of grant 
accordingly  the company accrued million relating to these stock appreciation rights as employee benefits expense in toward the difference between current market values and the values at the grant date 
additional increases in total non interest expense in were attributable to increases in occupancy expense  primarily the result of operating four additional banking offices due to the acquisition of ksb in salary expenses increased 
million in primarily due to an increase in staffing expense associated with the acquisition of ksb 
in  total non interest expense increased 
million to million primarily due to an increase in salaries  wages and employee benefits of million  reflecting the addition of new employees relating to the ksb acquisition 
there were full time equivalent employees at december  versus at december  non payroll related expenses  excluding occupancy and equipment expenses  decreased 
million to million in from million in  primarily due to decreases in expenses associated with other real estate and fdic insurance assessment and other expense items 
expenses associated with other real estate decreased in primarily due to management aggressively disposing of these properties  as total other real estate continued its downward trend to less than 
of total assets at december  the fdic deposit assessment decreased significantly from 
million for to thousand for  due to a reduction in rates by the fdic charged on deposits for well capitalized banks 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the pennsylvania bank shares tax in the pennsylvania bank shares tax is based on the average capital of a bank 
since the bank has a strong capital position  the pennsylvania bank shares tax expense will increase as the bank s capital grows 
additionally  there were increases in expenses associated with professional fees  data processing  advertising  printing and supplies primarily due to the ksb acquisition in in  non payroll related expenses  excluding occupancy and equipment expenses  decreased 
million to million in from million in  primarily due to decreases in expenses associated with other real estate and fdic insurance assessment 
additionally  there were increases in expenses associated with fees  data processing  advertising  postage and express mail  training and education 
accounting for income taxes the provision for federal income taxes was million in as compared to million for and million for the increases in the tax provision for  and are due to higher taxable income of approximately million  
million and million for  and  respectively 
these increases in taxable income are partially due to lower levels of tax exempt income for both years  as the tax free investment securities portfolio continues to shrink due to bond calls 
accounting for debt and equity securities the bank adopted sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  at january  this standard requires investments in securities to be classified in one of three categories  held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
debt securities that the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are reported at amortized cost 
as the bank does not engage in security trading  the balance of its debt securities and any equity securities are classified as available for sale 
net unrealized gains and losses for such securities  net of tax effect  are required to be recognized as a separate component of stockholders equity and excluded from the determination of net income 
since the majority of the bank s investments are classified as held to maturity  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant effect on stockholders equity at january  and december  asset liability management the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
this process is overseen by the asset liability committee alco which monitors and controls  among other variables  the liquidity  balance sheet structure and interest rate risk of the consolidated company within policy parameters established and outlined in the funds  cash flow and liquidity policies and procedures which are reviewed by the board of directors at least annually 
additionally  the alco committee meets periodically and reports on liquidity  interest rate sensitivity and projects financial performance in various interest rate scenarios 
liquidity 
liquidity is the ability of the financial institution to ensure that adequate funds will be available to meet its financial commitments as they become due 
in managing its liquidity position  the financial institution evaluates all sources of funds  the largest of which is deposits 
also taken into consideration is the repayment of loans 
these sources provide the financial institution with alternatives to meet its short term liquidity needs 
longer term liquidity needs may be met by issuing longer term deposits and by raising additional capital 
rbpa generally maintains a liquidity ratio equal to or greater than of total deposits and short term liabilities 
liquidity is specifically defined as the ratio of net cash  short term and marketable assets to net deposits and short term liabilities 
the liquidity ratio for the years ended december   and was    respectively 
management believes that rbpa s liquidity position continues to be adequate  continues to be in excess of its peer group level and meets or exceeds the liquidity target set forth in the funds  cash flow and liquidity policies and procedures 
management believes that due to its financial position  it will be able to raise deposits as needed to meet liquidity demands 
however  any financial institution could have unmet liquidity demands at any time 
interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the financial institution s assets and liabilities 
these include the volume of assets and liabilities repricing  the timing of repricing  and the relative levels of repricing 
attempting to minimize the interest rate sensitivity gaps is a continual challenge in a changing rate environment 
the interest sensitivity report examines the positioning of the interest rate risk exposure in a changing interest rate environment 
ideally the rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be maintained in a matched position to minimize interest rate risk 
at december   rbpa is in a slightly asset sensitive position which indicates assets will reprice more quickly than liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis is an important management tool  however  it does have some inherent shortcomings 
it is a static analysis 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given period 
the following table summarizes repricing intervals for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   and the difference or gap between them on an actual and cumulative basis for the periods indicated 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
during a period of falling interest rates  a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely

regulatory minimum capital level leverage ratio risk based capital ratio tier tier capital performance return on average assets return on average equity rbpa s sources of capital have been derived from the issuance of stock as well as retained earnings 
however  rbpa has not had a stock offering since total stockholder s equity has increased 
at december   rbpa had an average capital to average asset ratio of 
rbpa has no current plans to raise capital through new stock offerings and indeed  seeks ways to leverage its existing capital which is considered excessive by industry standards 
in early  each of the federal bank regulatory agencies issued risk based capital standards which were phased in december  the new standards place assets in various categories of risk with varying weights assigned  and consider certain off balance sheet activities  such as letters of credit and loan commitments in the base for purposes of determining capital adequacy 
the principal objective of establishing the risk based capital framework is to achieve greater convergence in the measurement and assessment of capital adequacy due to the divergence of asset mixes maintained from one depository institution to the next 
at december   rbpa s ratio using these standards was 
management options to purchase securities on june   the directors of the bank approved the royal bank of pennsylvania stock option and appreciation right plan the plan 
the plan was reapproved by the shareholders in connection with the formation of the holding company 
the plan is an incentive program under which bank officers and other key employees may be awarded additional compensation in the form of options to purchase up to  shares of the registrant s class a common stock but not in excess of of outstanding shares 
at the same time a stock option is issued a stock appreciation right for an identical number of shares is also granted 
the option price is equal to the fair market value at the date of the grant 
at december    options have been granted the fair market per share at the time of the grant was in and in which are exercisable at per year 
at december   options covering  shares were exercisable 
in  the directors of the bank approved a non qualified outside directors stock option plan 
the plan was reapproved by the shareholders in connection with the formation of the holding company 
under the terms of the plan   shares of class a stock are authorized for grants 
each director is entitled to  shares of stock annually which is exercisable after one year of service 
the options were granted at the fair market value per share in and in at the date of the grant 
currently  the strike price on the options ranges from to per share 
during   options were exercised at strike prices ranging from to per share 
at december    options were outstanding and options covering  shares were exercisable
