the discussion below contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties relating to the future financial performance of regeneron pharmaceuticals  inc regeneron or the company and actual events or results may differ materially 
these statements concern  among other things  the possible therapeutic applications of the company s product candidates and research programs  the timing and nature of the company s clinical and research programs now underway or planned  a variety of items described herein and in the footnotes to the company s financial statements including the useful life of assets  the anticipated length of agreements  and other matters  and the future uses of capital and financial needs of the company 
these statements are made by the company based on management s current beliefs and judgment 
in evaluating such statements  stockholders and investors should specifically consider the various factors identified under the caption factors that may affect future operating results which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
regeneron is a new york corporation founded in it is a leader in the application of molecular and cell biology to discover novel potential therapies for human medical conditions 
the company is applying its technological expertise in protein growth factors  their receptors  and their mechanisms of action to the discovery and development of neurotrophic factors for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative disease  peripheral neuropathy  and nerve injury 
more recently  regeneron has used its technological expertise to attempt to identify treatments for diseases and conditions outside of the nervous system  such as inflammatory and muscle disease  angiogenesis  hematopoiesis  and cancer 
in addition to conducting research and development during through  highlights of regeneron s operations included o during  the company completed phase ii clinical trials and commenced phase iii clinical trials in the united states of ciliary neurotrophic factor cntf to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als  commonly known as lou gehrig s disease 
in addition  in accordance with its collaboration agreement with amgen inc amgen  amgen initiated clinical trials of brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf  on behalf of amgen regeneron partners  for the treatment of als 
the company also added and renovated laboratory and administrative space  including the rensselaer facility 
in  the company raised a total of approximately million  primarily from the sale of common stock to glaxo wellcome plc glaxo and in a public offering 
o during  the company discontinued its phase iii clinical study of cntf to treat als and implemented a strategy to concentrate on its most promising product candidates and its discovery research efforts and to seek additional corporate partnerships and licensing agreements 
regeneron also reduced its workforce by approximately  to approximately employees  and incurred a charge of approximately million in connection with costs associated with the reduction in force 
o during  amgen  on behalf of amgen regeneron partners  began a phase iii clinical trial of bdnf for the treatment of als designed to determine the safety and efficacy of bdnf to treat als 
amgen and regeneron also analyzed results from the phase i clinical trial and planned a further clinical trial of neurotrophin nt for peripheral neuropathy 
the company continued to develop and manufacture bdnf for use by sumitomo pharmaceuticals company  ltd 
sumitomo pharmaceuticals in japan 
during the second quarter of  the company announced preclinical research discoveries by regeneron scientists in the areas of cancer  muscle disease  and angiogenesis 
in the third quarter of  the company entered into a long term manufacturing agreement with merck co  inc the merck agreement under which the company will produce at its rensselaer  new york facility an intermediate for an existing merck pediatric vaccine 
in the fourth quarter of  the company raised million in net proceeds from a public offering of common stock 
the company settled a securities class action lawsuit against the company and two individuals 
as part of the settlement  the company issued  shares of common stock in january o during  amgen  on behalf of amgen regeneron partners  completed the treatment phase of the phase iii clinical trial designed to determine the safety and efficacy of bdnf delivered subcutaneously for the treatment of als 
in addition  amgen  on behalf of amgen regeneron partners  continued to conduct a phase i ii clinical trial of nt for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes 
amgen also continued to conduct a phase i ii clinical trial of bdnf in europe for the treatment of neuropathy caused by diabetes and started a phase i clinical trial of bdnf delivered intrathecally for the treatment of als 
the company continued to develop and manufacture bdnf for use by sumitomo pharmaceuticals in japan and continued preclinical research programs in the areas of inflammatory and muscle disease  angiogenesis  hematopoiesis  and cancer 
in april  amgen purchased from the company three million shares of common stock for million 
the purchase price also included five year warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in june  the company entered into a worldwide exclusive joint development agreement with medtronic inc medtronic to collaborate on research and development of a family of therapeutics for central nervous system diseases and disorders using experimental regeneron compounds and medtronic delivery systems 
the initial target of the medtronic collaboration will be the development of axokine trademark for the potential treatment of huntington s disease  using medtronic s implantable pump to infuse axokine into the central nervous system 
medtronic purchased from the company  shares of common stock for million  the purchase price included five year warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in october  regeneron entered into a research collaboration with pharmacopeia  inc pharmacopeia to discover and develop small molecule drugs that mimic or antagonize growth factors or cytokines 
in december  the company entered into an exclusive worldwide agreement with procter gamble pharmaceuticals  inc procter gamble to discover and develop therapeutics for muscle diseases and disorders 
procter gamble agreed to purchase shares of common stock for million and make a minimum of three and up to five million annual payments to the company to support collaborative muscle research 
procter gamble paid the million to regeneron in december in march  the price per share was set at based on a percent premium over an average market price and regeneron issued  shares of restricted common stock to procter gamble 
in january  amgen and regeneron announced that the phase iii clinical trial of bdnf delivered subcutaneously did not demonstrate clinical efficacy in patients with als  that no further subsequent subcutaneous development of bdnf for als was planned  and that the trial confirmed the safety and tolerability of bdnf seen in earlier trials 
the failure of the phase iii trial to achieve its primary end points had a materially adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock which declined more than immediately after the announcement of the results of the trial 
after the phase iii clinical trial results were announced  the company retained independent experts in the fields of neurology and gastroenterology  as well as independent statisticians  to conduct further examination of the data 
this review by the company and the outside panels indicated that a subset of als patients in the trial may have received a benefit from bdnf treatment and that bdnf appeared to have an effect on the gastrointestinal system and might have a therapeutic role in treating constipating conditions  among other disorders 
the panels recommended  among other things  that additional clinical and preclinical investigations of subcutaneous bdnf for als and bdnf for gastrointestinal conditions should be undertaken 
the company is reviewing these recommendations and the phase iii data and is discussing with amgen and sumitomo pharmaceuticals whether to undertake these or other investigations of bdnf 
further development of bdnf in the united states must be undertaken in accordance with the terms of the company s collaboration agreement with amgen 
although sumitomo pharmaceuticals had planned a phase i safety assessment of bdnf early in  they are currently reviewing their bdnf development plan in light of the recently available information 
the results of the company s and its collaborators past activities in connection with the research and development of bdnf and nt do not necessarily predict the results or success of future activities including  but not limited to  any additional preclinical or clinical studies of bdnf or nt the company can not predict whether  when  or under what conditions bdnf or nt will be shown to be safe or effective to treat any human condition or be approved for marketing by any regulatory agency 
the delay or failure of current or future studies to demonstrate the safety or efficacy of bdnf or nt to treat human conditions or to be approved for marketing would have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company and amgen are conducting a phase i trial of bdnf for als using intrathecal delivery 
while intrathecal delivery may be more successful in delivering bdnf to certain motor neurons the nerve cells that degenerate in als  it is not known whether intrathecal delivery will prove any more successful in demonstrating safety and utility in patients with als than the subcutaneous delivery used in the phase iii clinical trial that failed to achieve its primary end points 
in addition  the potential success of any current or future bdnf clinical trial for the treatment of als will be dependent upon  among other things  certain factors that could undermine the significance of the data collected from such patients 
for example  patients who take rilutek trademark  an orally administered drug marketed by rhone poulenc rorer for the treatment of als  might enroll in a bdnf trial 
also  other medications for the treatment of als are available on an experimental basis and may be approved for marketing in the future 
the clinical effects of taking bdnf in combination with other drugs is unknown and therefore unanticipated effects could complicate a bdnf clinical trial or render the data collected difficult to analyze or interpret 
the design of any bdnf clinical trial will attempt to take into account the inclusion of patients who may be taking other medications  including rilutek 
however  if a clinical study is compromised through the inclusion of patients who were taking rilutek or other medications  with or without the consent or knowledge of the trial sponsor  the results of the study may be undermined and additional clinical studies may be required  causing a delay in  and increasing the costs of  the development of bdnf  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
if additional studies of bdnf for als are undertaken  the time and expense required for such trials could be material to the company and the outcome will be uncertain 
if subsequent trials are conducted and such trials fail to demonstrate that bdnf is safe and effective in the treatment of als  that failure could have a materially adverse effect on the company  the price of the company s common stock  and the company s ability to raise additional capital 
no assurance can be given that extended administration of nt will be safe or effective 
the phase i study of nt in normal human volunteers that concluded in was a short term seven day treatment study 
the study involves substantially longer treatment six months or longer 
in the phase i study  two out of the seventy six patients developed significant abnormalities in blood tests of their liver function 
these laboratory abnormalities reversed after cessation of treatment and were not associated with any other evidence of liver dysfunction 
similar abnormalities have not been observed in preclinical toxicology studies with nt however  if such abnormalities were to occur in a number of patients in subsequent trials  including the study  this result could delay or preclude the further development of nt the treatment of peripheral neuropathy associated with cancer chemotherapy or diabetes may present additional clinical trial risks in light of the complex and not wholly understood mechanisms of action that lead to the neuropathies  the presence of many other drugs to treat the underlying conditions  the potential difficulty of achieving significant clinical endpoints  and other factors 
no assurance can be given that these or any other studies of nt will be successful or that nt will be commercialized 
to date  regeneron has not received any revenues from the commercial sale of products and may not receive any such revenues for several years 
before such revenues can be realized  the company or its collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing its research and development efforts and obtaining regulatory approval from the united states food and drug administration fda or regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render the company s products and technologies noncompetitive and obsolete 
in the absence of revenues from commercial product sales or other sources the amount  timing  nature  or source of which can not be predicted  the company s losses will continue as the company conducts its research and development activities 
the company s activities may expand over time and may require additional resources  and the company s operating losses may be substantial over at least the next several years 
the company s losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend  among other factors  on the timing of certain expenses and on the progress of the company s research and development efforts 
results of operations years ended december  and the company s total revenue decreased to million in from in contract research and development revenue decreased to million in from million in contract research and development revenue earned from sumitomo pharmaceuticals decreased to million in from million in of the sumitomo pharmaceuticals revenue  million was for contract research and million was reimbursement for developing manufacturing processes for bdnf and supplying bdnf 
of the sumitomo pharmaceuticals revenue  million was for contract research including million related to a non recurring contract research payment  and million was reimbursement for developing manufacturing processes for bdnf and supplying bdnf 
contract research and development revenue earned from amgen and amgen regeneron partners decreased to million in from million this reflects a decision by the partnership to focus more spending in on clinical trials and precommercial activities conducted by amgen and less spending on preclinical research conducted by regeneron 
during  the company entered into the merck agreement 
contract manufacturing revenue in and related to this agreement aggregated million and million  respectively 
investment income for increased to million from million in  primarily due to increased levels of interest bearing investments resulting from the sale by the company of equity securities in a public offering in november and in private placements to amgen  medtronic  and procter gamble in april  june  and december  respectively 
the company s total operating expenses increased to million in from million in research and development expense increased to million in from million in  primarily due to costs related to the company s preclinical research programs  as well as the costs of increased activity in the company s rensselaer  new york manufacturing facility related to the company s agreement with sumitomo pharmaceuticals 
loss in amgen regeneron partners increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased costs related to clinical trials and other activities conducted by amgen on behalf of the partnership 
research and development expenses  including the loss in amgen regeneron partners  were approximately of total operating expenses in  compared to in general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in as expenses remained consistent year to year 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in  resulting from the expiration of capital leases during and contract manufacturing of million in were direct expenses related to contract manufacturing for merck 
other expenses of million in related to recognition of the company s contribution to the settlement of shareholder class action litigation 
the company s net loss in was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in years ended december  and the company s total revenue increased to million in from million in contract research and development revenue increased to million in from million in contract research and development revenue earned from sumitomo pharmaceuticals increased to million in from million in of the sumitomo pharmaceuticals revenue  million was for contract research and million was reimbursement for developing manufacturing processes for bdnf and supplying bdnf 
of the sumitomo pharmaceuticals revenue  million was for contract research including million related to a non recurring contract research payment  and million was reimbursement for developing manufacturing processes for bdnf and supplying bdnf 
contract research and development revenue earned from amgen and amgen regeneron partners decreased to million in from million in this decrease was the result of the company providing less research support to the partnership 
during  the company received a million research milestone payment from amgen upon the filing of an ind for nt  as provided for in the amgen agreement 
in  the company entered into a long term manufacturing agreement with merck  and contract manufacturing revenue related to this agreement totaled million 
investment income in  increased to million from million in  primarily due to capital losses of million in  a rise in interest rates in  and interest earned on the net proceeds of the company s november public offering  offset by reduced levels of interest bearing investments in the first ten months of the year as the company expended funds during for capital assets  research and development  and other operating expenses 
the company s total operating expenses decreased to million in from million in research and development expense decreased to million in from million in the company s research and development expenses decreased primarily due to discontinuance of the company s clinical study of cntf in june  when that study failed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of cntf to treat als 
this decrease was partially offset by additional expenses related to the company s collaboration with sumitomo pharmaceuticals 
loss in amgen regeneron partners increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased costs related to the initiation in the third quarter of of the phase iii bdnf clinical trial conducted by amgen on behalf of amgen regeneron partners 
research and development expenses  including the loss in amgen regeneron partners  were approximately of total operating expenses in  compared to in general and administrative expense decreased to million in from million in  primarily because the period reflected lower costs associated with the company s reduced staff and because the period included a charge of approximately million for costs associated with a reduction in workforce following the discontinuance of the company s clinical study of cntf 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in from million in  reflecting depreciation of the rensselaer facility  which became fully operational in july  equipment and leasehold improvements placed in service during  and increased patent amortization expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in other expenses related to recognition in the third quarter of of a million expense as the company s contribution to the settlement of shareholder class action litigation 
the company s net loss in was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in liquidity and capital resources since its inception in  the company has financed its operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of its equity securities  revenue earned under the several agreements between the company and each of amgen  sumitomo chemical company  ltd  sumitomo pharmaceuticals  merck  medtronic  and procter gamble and investment income 
in connection with the company s agreement to collaborate with sumitomo pharmaceuticals in the research and development of bdnf in japan  sumitomo pharmaceuticals paid the company million and agreed to pay the company an additional million in sumitomo pharmaceuticals has the option to cancel the payment  however  if such a cancellation were to occur  sumitomo pharmaceutical s rights to develop and commercialize bdnf in japan would revert to the company 
in addition  the company is being reimbursed in connection with supplying sumitomo pharmaceuticals with bdnf for preclinical use 
under the amgen agreement  amgen was required to make defined payments through june to the company for research and development efforts in the united states in connection with bdnf and nt the amgen agreement provided that after amgen determined that ind applications should be filed for bdnf and nt  amgen regeneron partners would thereafter conduct the development and commercialization of these product candidates on behalf of amgen regeneron partners 
amgen regeneron partners began operations in june with respect to bdnf and in january with respect to nt amgen s required payments for bdnf and nt were made directly to regeneron prior to the determination by amgen that the preparation of an ind for each compound should commence and thereafter to amgen regeneron partners 
the company s further activities relating to bdnf and nt  as agreed upon by amgen and regeneron  are being reimbursed by amgen regeneron partners  and the company recognizes such reimbursement as revenue 
the funding of amgen regeneron partners is through capital contributions from amgen and regeneron  who must make equal payments in order to maintain equal ownership and equal sharing of any profits or losses from the partnership 
the company has made capital contributions totaling approximately million to amgen regeneron partners from the partnership s inception in june through december  the company expects that its capital contributions in will total approximately million to million 
these contributions could increase or decrease  depending upon the cost of amgen regeneron partners conducting additional bdnf and nt preclinical and clinical studies and the outcomes of those and other ongoing studies 
capital contributions beyond are also anticipated to be significant 
in september  the company entered into the merck agreement 
depending on the volume of the intermediate supplied to merck  total capital and product payments from merck to regeneron could total million or more over the term of the agreement  which is expected to extend to this agreement may be terminated at any time by merck upon the payment by merck of a termination fee 
from its inception in january through december   exclusive of construction in progress  the company invested approximately million in property  plant and equipment  including million to acquire and renovate the rensselaer facility and million of new construction that is in progress related to the modification of the facility in connection with the merck agreement 
in connection with the purchase and renovation of the rensselaer facility  the company obtained financing of million from the new york state urban development corporation  of which million is outstanding 
under the terms of such financing the company is not permitted to declare or pay dividends to its stockholders 
during  the company entered into a series of new leasing agreements the new lease line which provides up to million to finance equipment acquisitions and certain building improvements  as defined  collectively  the equipment 
the company may utilize the new lease line in increments leases 
lease terms are for four years after which the company is required to purchase the equipment at defined amounts 
certain of the leases will be renewed for eight months at defined monthly payments after which the company will own the equipment 
at december  the company had available approximately million of the new lease line 
the company expects that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the united states and foreign countries 
the company is currently involved in two interference proceedings in the patent and trademark office between regeneron s patent applications and patents relating to cntf issued to synergen  inc amgen acquired all outstanding shares of synergen in as of december   the company had no established banking arrangements through which it could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
additional funds may be raised through  among other things  the issuance of additional securities  other financing arrangements  and future collaboration agreements 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
at december   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
the company expects to incur ongoing funding requirements for capital contributions to amgen regeneron partners to support the continued development and clinical trials of bdnf and nt the company also expects to incur substantial funding requirements for  among other things  its research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing  validation of its manufacturing facilities  and the acquisition of equipment  and may incur substantial funding requirements for expenses related to the patent interference proceedings and other patent matters 
the amount needed to fund operations will also depend on other factors  including the status of competitive products  the success of the company s research and development programs  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights developments  and the extent and success of any collaborative research programs 
the company expects to incur additional capital expenditures in connection with the renovation and validation of its rensselaer facility pursuant to its manufacturing agreement with merck 
however  the company also expects that such expenditures will be substantially reimbursed by merck  subject to certain conditions 
the company believes that its existing capital resources will enable it to meet operating needs into no assurance can be given that there will be no change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to the company s capital being consumed at a faster rate than currently expected 
in order to continue to attempt to assure regeneron s financial condition and maximize its technological developments for the long term benefit of shareholders  the company from time to time seeks additional corporate partners and explores other opportunities to obtain research and development funding 
no assurance can be given that such partners or funding will be available or  if available  will be on terms favorable or acceptable to the company 
factors that may affect future operating results regeneron cautions stockholders and investors that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  regeneron s actual results and could cause regeneron s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  regeneron 
the statements under this caption are intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the following information is not intended to limit in any way the characterization of other statements or information under other captions as cautionary statements for such purpose o delay  difficulty  or failure in obtaining regulatory approval including approval of its facilities for production for the company s products including vaccine intermediate for merck  including delays or difficulties in development because of insufficient proof of safety or efficacy 
o delay  difficulty  or failure of the company s preclinical drug research and development programs to produce product candidates that are scientifically or commercially appropriate for further development by the company or others 
o increased and irregular costs of development  regulatory approval  manufacture  sales  and marketing associated with the introduction of products in the late stage of development 
o cancellation or termination of material collaborative or licensing agreements could result in loss of research or other funding and have other material adverse effects on the company and its operations 
a change of control of one or more of the company s material collaborators or licensees could also have a material adverse effect on the company 
o competitive or market factors may cause use of the company s products to be limited or otherwise fail to achieve broad acceptance 
o the ability to obtain  maintain  and prosecute intellectual property rights  and the cost of acquiring in process technology and other intellectual property rights  either by license  collaboration  or purchase of another entity 
o difficulties or high costs of obtaining adequate financing to meet the company s obligations under its collaboration and licensing agreements or to fund percent of the cost of developing product candidates in order to retain percent of the commercialization rights

as regeneron s scientific efforts lead to potentially promising new directions  both outside of recombinant protein therapies into orally active  small molecule pharmaceuticals and outside of treatments for neurological and neurodegenerative conditions into  for example  potential programs in cancer  inflammation  muscle disease  angiogenesis  and hematopoiesis  the company will require additional internal expertise or external collaborations in areas in which it currently does not have substantial resources and personnel 
impact of the adoption of recently issued accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standard no 
 earnings per share sfas 
sfas will require the company to replace the current presentation of primary per share data with basic and diluted per share data 
currently  outstanding common stock equivalents are antidilutive and therefore management estimates that the future adoption of sfas currently will not have a material impact on the company s per share data 
sfas will be adopted by the company for periods ending after december
