as part of the restructuring the company relocated its digital engineering group to a new facility in phoenix  arizona 
the company made significant progress in the development of two new modem products  the sm and sm the sm was introduced and began shipping in the fourth quarter of the sm hardware is in production and the final software routines are being completed with the first shipments expected in the second quarter of fiscal the company also made significant progress in its new starlink product line

results of operations for the fiscal years  and revenue sales were million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a year to year decrease of less than one percent in compared to an increase of in the slight decline in revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted from declines in the average selling prices in the company s transceiver products  partially offset by higher revenues generated by the company s modem products

sse data sales were million in fiscal gross margin the gross margin was million or of sales in fiscal  compared to million or and million or of sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the gross margin dollar and percentage decrease in was due to a defective component in certain of the company s satellite transceivers for which the company recorded a million special warranty charge  the impact of the restructuring of the modem manufacturing operations  and increased competition resulting in declines in the average selling price of the company s products 
the gross margin percentage decline in fiscal was caused by several factors as well competitive price reductions  product mix shifts toward lower power transceiver models that carry lower margins and the significantly higher manufacturing startup costs associated with the new star line of transceivers 
the company expects the gross margin percentage to return to past levels as the new product lines come into full production in however  there can be no assurance that competitive pressure on average selling prices will not reduce gross margin in the future  that the product mix will continue at its current levels  or that full manufacturing efficiencies will be achieved upon reaching full production levels 
operating expenses research and development spending grew by to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  and from million in fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were  and in fiscal  and  respectively

the increase in expense in fiscal  as compared with the prior fiscal year  was primarily related to the increased costs associated with larger sales and sales support staffs  commission expenses resulting from higher sales levels  and sales and marketing programs to launch new products and to enter into new markets worldwide 
the company s investment in its marketing  general and administrative functions may vary as a percentage of sales in the future 
restructuring expenses associated with the consolidation of the company s manufacturing facilities was  and consisted of a write down for certain intangibles acquired as part of the purchase of the assets of fairchild data corporation in fiscal  severance for employees which was paid in early fiscal  and other various costs incurred in transferring the manufacturing capability in scottsdale  arizona and consolidating it with the transceiver product lines in fremont  california

factors that may affect future financial results information contained in this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  many of which can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  plan  intend  or continue or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology 
there are a number of important factors with respect to such forward looking statements  including certain risks and uncertainties  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward looking statements 
numerous factors  such as economic and competitive conditions  incoming order levels  timing of product shipments  product margins  new product development  and reliance on key consumers in international sales could cause actual results to differ from those described in these statements and prospective investors and stockholders should carefully consider these factors in evaluating these forward looking statements 
particular factors that may affect future financial results are sales of the company s products are concentrated in a small number of customers 
for fiscal  the largest five customers accounted for of sales 
the loss of any existing customer  a significant reduction in the level of sales to any existing customer  or the failure of the company to gain additional customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a substantial portion of shipments historically have occurred near the end of each quarter 
accordingly  the company s results are difficult to predict and delays in product delivery or closing of a sale can cause revenues and net income to fluctuate significantly from anticipated levels and from quarter to quarter 
the market for the company s products are very competitive and the company expects that competition will increase 
the company believes that its ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors both within and outside its control  including price  quality  delivery  product performance and features  timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors  and customer service and support 
price pressure is expected to continue in the satellite transceiver and modem market in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the company expects to continue to experience declining average sales prices for its products 
the company s future gross margin is dependent upon its ability to reduce costs in line with or faster than declines in sales prices 
the company s manufacturing operations are highly dependent upon the delivery of quality materials by outside suppliers in a timely manner 
from time to time the company has experienced delivery delays from key suppliers which impacted sales 
in addition  as was experienced in  certain vendor supplied materials occasionally have quality issues which impact sales and customer support costs 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material supply problems or component issues in the future
