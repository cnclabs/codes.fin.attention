overview trends in the demand for aluminum sheet products in the united states and in the prices of aluminum primary metal and scrap affect the business of the company 
the company s operating results also are affected by factors specific to the company  such as the margins between selling prices for its aluminum sheet and its cost of metal material margins and its unit cost of converting metal into aluminum sheet products conversion cost 
a company objective is to increase value by increasing its share of markets for higher margin products 
although the demand for aluminum sheet products is cyclical  over the longer term demand has continued to increase  reflecting general population and economic growth and the advantages of aluminum s light weight  high degree of formability  resistance to corrosion  recyclability and abundant supply 
the price of aluminum metal affects the price of the company s products and in the longer term can have an effect on the competitive position of aluminum in relation to alternative materials 
the price of primary metal is determined largely by worldwide supply and demand conditions and is highly cyclical 
for example  during the past years the average annual cash price per pound of aluminum for transactions on the london metals exchange peaked at in  declined to in  rose to in and declined to in the price of primary aluminum in world markets greatly influences the price of aluminum scrap  the company s principal raw material 
significant movements in the price of primary aluminum can affect the company s margins because aluminum sheet prices do not move simultaneously nor necessarily to the same degree as the primary markets 
the company seeks to manage its material margins by focusing on higher margin products and by accessing the scrap and primary metal markets in the most cost effective manner  including the use of futures contracts to hedge anticipated raw material requirements and firm priced sales orders 
the company s material margins declined in the early s  principally due to excess capacity in the industry and reduced demand as a result of recessionary economic conditions which caused aluminum sheet prices to decrease faster than raw material prices 
margins increased during and due to a change in product mix to higher margin products and increased demand 
during margins declined to the lowest level since as distributors and end users reduced inventory levels and activity in some end use markets declined 
the company believes that this inventory reduction is largely completed 
during the past five years the company has lowered its unit conversion costs by increasing production throughput and by reducing costs generally through improved employee productivity  higher machine utilization rates and greater manufacturing efficiency 
the company believes its conversion costs to be among the lowest in the industry 
shipments of electrical conduit and cable continued to increase during as demand in the construction  renovation and remodeling markets remained strong 
margins improved during the year as aluminum and copper prices declined substantially 
the company believes that shipments should continue to increase in due to penetration of do it yourself markets and further development of the market for alflex s pre fabricated wiring systems 
on september   the company acquired castech aluminum group inc  castech in a transaction accounted for under the purchase method of accounting at an aggregate cost including fees and expenses estimated at million

net sales for increased to million from million in the acquisition of castech accounted for about million of net sales 
average selling prices for aluminum sheet products decreased to per pound from per pound in this decline reflected lower metal costs  with the average london metals exchange traded cash settlement price for primary aluminum declining to per pound in from per pound in  and competitive pressures as demand weakened
