included in the revenue was a million initiation fee from hmri in connection with the chronic anemia program  which was recorded in the quarter ended march  the increase in revenues was partially offset by a decrease in revenues related to the completion on december  of the funded discovery phase of the company s collaborative program with wyeth ayerst laboratories wyeth relating to the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of diabetes and osteoporosis and the completion on september  of the funded collaboration with becton  dickinson and company becton relating to the development of serum based cancer diagnostics 
sales revenues  representing primarily service revenue from the pharmaceutical division of the company s aston molecules ltd

the balance of the decrease represents changes in the timing and amount of grant awards 
expenses research and development expenses increased by approximately million or in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased by approximately  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to the expansion of the company s joint ventures with biochem pharma international inc biochem pharma and anaderm corporation  and the new collaborative agreements with sankyo and hmri 
although the company incurred expense in connection with its serum based cancer diagnostics collaboration with bayer  these expenses generally were offset relative to the comparable periods in the prior fiscal year by the elimination of expenditures with respect to i the company s former tissue based cancer diagnostics collaboration with becton  which expired on september  and ii the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of diabetes and osteoporosis by wyeth which was competed december  also contributing to the increase in expenses were costs associated with the expansion of the company s natural products discovery and medicinal chemistry operations at its mycosearch  inc mycosearch and aston subsidiaries 
the company acquired mycosearch in april in addition  research and development expenses included the amortization of the company s compound library assets which increased by approximately million in fiscal reflecting a full year of amortization of the fungi cultures acquired in april upon the acquisition of mycosearch 
the increase in fiscal was due to an increase in expenditures in the company s joint venture with biochem pharma  and its technology development programs as well as additional amortization expense on the newly acquired mycosearch assets 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in expenditures in the collaborative programs  primarily with hmri 
production and service costs increased approximately  in fiscal  and decreased approximately  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to the acquisition of aston s pharmaceutical development business 
the decrease in fiscal was due to the company s sale of the research products business

amortization of intangibles in fiscal   and represents amortization of patents and goodwill that resulted from the acquisition of the cancer diagnostics business of applied biotechnology in fiscal and aston in fiscal the decrease in amortization expense in fiscal is due to the portion of goodwill which was expensed in connection with the sale of the company s research products business 
the goodwill related to applied biotechnology approximated  per annum and was fully amortized as of september amortization expense in fiscal includes the first year of amortization of the goodwill from the acquisition of aston totaling  other income and expense net investment income decreased approximately  or for fiscal compared to fiscal  this decrease was a result of the decline in principal balance invested 
net investment income increased approximately million or for fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was largely due to investment of the proceeds from the company s public offering of common stock in april net proceeds from the offering along with the concurrent sale of  shares directly to biochem pharma were approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources at september   working capital representing primarily cash  cash equivalents and short term investments aggregated approximately million 
the company is dependent upon collaborative research revenues  government research grants  interest income and cash balances  and will remain so until products developed from its technology are successfully commercialized 
the company believes that with the funding from its collaborative research programs  government research grants  interest income  and cash balances  its financial resources are adequate for its operations for approximately the next four years based on its current business plan even if no milestone payments or royalties are received during this period 
however  the company s capital requirements may vary as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  competitive and technological developments  funds required for further expansion or enhancement of the company s technology platform  including possible additional joint ventures  collaborations and acquisitions  potential milestone payments  and the time and expense required to obtain governmental approval of products  some of which factors are beyond the company s control 
one of the company s strategic objectives is to manage its financial resources and the growth of its drug discovery and development programs so as to balance its proprietary efforts and co ventures with its funded collaborations 
in pursuing this objective  the company in fiscal has expanded the scope of its discovery and development activities without significantly increasing its rate of cash consumption 
an example of this was the conversion of the company s chronic anemia program from an exclusively proprietary effort to a funded collaboration with hmri in the second quarter of fiscal this made additional resources formerly allocated to the proprietary chronic anemia program available for other proprietary programs and co ventures without requiring an increase in the rate of cash consumption 
the company expects to continue its current level of expenditures and capital investment over the next several years to enhance its drug discovery technologies  pursue internal proprietary drug discovery programs  and to commit resources to co ventures with pharmaceutical companies 
examples of the company s co ventures with pharmaceutical companies include the formation of helicon therapeutics  inc in july with cold spring harbor laboratory and roche  the formation of anaderm corporation in april with pfizer 
and new york university  the company s co ventures with biochem pharma  which commenced in may  and with sepracor  inc  which commenced in march generally the company expects to commit greater resources to such programs in exchange for greater commercialization rights  as compared to its traditional collaborative research programs in which the company receives research funding and royalties on sales of commercialized products 
if the developmental activities on which one or more of these ventures are focused are successful  then the company will be required to make substantial additional capital investment in such venture s in order to maintain its percentage participation 
there can be no assurance that scheduled payments will be made by third parties  that current agreements will not be canceled  that government research grants will continue to be received at current levels  that milestone payments will be made  or that unanticipated events requiring the expenditure of funds will not occur 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any additional required funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
failure to obtain additional funds when required would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
