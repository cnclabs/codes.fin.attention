the remaining million anticipated cost represents estimated tenant buildouts and allowances 
additionally  the company is currently in the pre development and marketing stage for a property located in lake carmel  new york 
if appropriate tenant interest is obtained and the appropriate agreements  permits and approvals are received  the company intends to commence construction in the fall of management s view of the current state of the shopping center industry and its future direction is that value oriented retail concepts are merging  for example  outlet centers are including off price tenants as well as outlet tenants  off price centers have manufacturers outlets  community centers have destination tenants  and other community centers have outlet or off price tenants 
with this backdrop  management believes that a diversified shopping center portfolio will provide an opportunity for growth 
as part of the company s diversification strategy  a portion of the availability under the nomura credit facility was used to purchase five community centers in the raleigh  nc area on march  for a total purchase price of million 
the centers total approximately  square feet of gla  are well located and feature well known regional tenants 
management believes that there will be similar opportunities for the acquisition of community shopping centers in the united states  and in particular  the southeastern region of the country 
the company s current acquisition  expansion and development plans are subject to certain risk and uncertainties  including  but not limited to economic conditions in the retail industry  future real estate market conditions  the availability of financing  and the risk associated with the company s property development activities  such as the potential for cost overruns  delays and the lack of predictability with respect to the financial returns associated with these development activities 
there can be no assurance that the planned development and expansions will occur according to current schedules or that  once commenced  such development and expansions will be completed 
based on current market conditions  the company believes it will have access to the capital resources or has adequate financial resources to fund operating expenses  distributions to stockholders  acquisitions and planned development and construction activities 
the million raised through the private placement with gildea and blackacre was used to fund the developments and expansions  repay certain debt obligations  settle certain costs incurred in connection with the termination of the opers factory outlet acquisition agreements and provide additional working capital 
the million nomura credit facility will have in excess of million of potential availability following the retirement of million of debt which existed at december  and the funding of the acquisition of the five community centers in march the company is in the process of reviewing various financing alternatives for its planned development of the power outlet mall located in lake carmel  new york  including a potential joint venture arrangement 
dividends declared on results totaled million  or per share 
on april   july  and october   the board of directors declared cash dividends of per share 
dividends on the series a preferred are to be paid quarterly on each common stock dividend payment date in an amount equal to the dividends that would have been paid on the common stock then issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred 
pursuant to the terms of the series a convertible preferred stock  dividends of  were paid 
the dividend payout ratio for the combined preferred and common dividends  as a percentage of funds from operations assuming full dilution  was for the year ended december  the board of directors determined that the company would not pay a fourth quarter dividend for in addition  the company announced that future dividends will be equal to of the company s taxable income which is the minimum dividend required to maintain its reit status 
determination of any dividends will be made annually following the review of the company s year end financial results 
the company s decision is driven by its goal to increase the total return to its shareholders through the use of internal cash flow to self fund some of its growth  such as expansions at existing centers and strategic acquisitions 
the company also will strive to reduce its borrowing levels and interest expense 
economic conditions inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years with certain segments of the economy experiencing disinflation  such as  apparel pricing which has slowed the growth of tenant sales which adversely impacts the company s revenue due to lower percentage and overage rents on some properties 
additionally  weakness in the overall retail environment as it relates to tenant sales volumes may have an impact on the company s ability to renew leases at current rental rates or to release space to other tenants 
although the decline in sales does not effect base rental  aside from renewals  this weakness could result in reduced revenue from percentage rent tenants  as well as  overage rent paid to the company 
both revenue items are directly impacted by sales volumes and represented of the company s total revenue in continuance of this trend may affect the company s operating centers the properties occupancy rate and the rental rates obtained and concessions  if any  granted on new leases or re leases of space  which may cause fluctuations in the cash flow from the operation and performance of the properties 
in the event of higher inflation  however  a majority of the tenants leases contain provisions designed to protect the company from the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rentals if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
the majority of the company s leases  other than those for anchors  require the tenants to pay a proportionate share of operating expenses  including marketing  common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
the company s leases with two of its anchor tenants  vf factory outlet and carolina pottery  which were executed prior to june  require the tenants to pay certain operating expenses and increases in common area maintenance expenses  which reduces the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
at december   of the aggregate gla of its factory outlet centers was leased to non anchor tenants under gross leases  pursuant to which the company is obligated to pay all utilities and other operating expenses of the applicable factory outlet center 
the properties are subject to operating risks common to commercial real estate in general  any and all of which may adversely affect occupancy or rental rates 
the properties are subject to increases in operating expenses such as cleaning  electricity  heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac  insurance and administrative costs  and other general costs associated with security  landscaping  repairs and maintenance 
while the company s tenants generally are currently obligated to pay a portion of these escalating costs  there can be no assurance that tenants will agree to pay such costs upon renewal or that new tenants will agree to pay such costs 
if operating expenses increase  the local rental market may limit the extent to which rents may be increased to meet increased expenses without decreasing occupancy rates 
additionally  inflation may have a negative impact on some of the company s other operating items 
interest and general and administrative expenses may be adversely affected by inflation as these specified costs could increase at a rate higher than rents 
approximately of the company s debt on income properties and notes payable as of december  bore interest at rates that adjust periodically based on market conditions 
also  for tenant leases with stated rent increases  inflation may have a negative effect as the stated rent increases in these leases could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time 
substantially all of the company s existing tenants have met their lease obligations and the company continues to attract and retain quality tenants
