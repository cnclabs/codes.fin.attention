item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview lst s revenues are derived from steel s three business segments oilfield products  specialty tubing products  and flat rolled steel and other tubular products and services 
products and markets 
the oilfield products business includes the manufacture and marketing of octg  the casing and tubing used in oil and gas well drilling and production  and line pipe that is used to gather and transport oil and gas from the well site to storage or refining facilities 
steel is one of the largest domestic producers and suppliers of octg  based on data compiled by the american iron steel institute 
octg represents over three fourths of steel s oilfield products volume as measured in tonnage  and exports have ranged from approximately to of this segment s shipments during the last three years 
demand for oilfield products is generally affected by customers expectations of future oil and gas prices and political factors such as energy and trade policies 
a key indicator of domestic demand is the average number of drilling rigs operating in the united states which  during the last three years  has been historically low 
according to baker hughes  the average united states rig counts in   and were   and  respectively 
demand is also affected by the amount of oilfield products imported into this country as well as available industry inventories 
imported octg represented approximately of the total supply in and  as compared to in a reduction of imported octg from levels experienced in the to period resulted from the imposition of protective tariffs on certain foreign countries in these trade tariffs  which were intended to promote an equitable trade environment  remained in effect during the effect of available inventory has not been a factor in the marketplace in the past three years but could increase in significance if octg mills operate at their full productive capacity for an extended period of time 
the volatility of oil and gas prices creates uncertainty with respect to the timing and extent of increased activity in the energy sector 
this affects customer confidence in the longer term outlook for energy prices and as a result some drilling projects may be deferred 
however  international markets strengthened considerably in as long postponed exploration and production projects were started 
this trend is expected to continue in as companies engaged in exploration and production continue to seek large reserves in the international arena 
steel s specialty tubing products segment includes two product groups dom tubing and as welded tubing 
specialty tubing consists of a wide array of high quality  custom made steel tubular products requiring critical tolerances  precise dimensional control  and special metallurgical properties 
these products are used in the further manufacture of automotive  construction  and other industrial equipment such as hydraulic cylinders  stabilizer tubes and intrusion devices  and machine parts 
specialty tubing is used in a wide range of industrial applications and  therefore  demand is sensitive to general economic conditions 
demand was down slightly in  however  open orders were up at year end as compared to year end international shipments of dom specialty tubing were   and of shipments in   and  respectively 
steel s participation in the flat rolled steel commodity market is generally concentrated in the southwestern region of the united states and is affected by factors such as price  capacity utilization  and raw material costs 
flat rolled steel produced by steel is primarily used by steel in the manufacture of tubular products but is also sold to customers for the manufacture of a variety of commercial and industrial products 
flat rolled steel is sold in highly competitive markets  with price  quality  and availability primarily determining customer purchase decisions 
manufacturing 
the manufacture of steel s products is capital intensive 
utilization rates have risen significantly during at steel s manufacturing facilities 
the level of production volume through steel s various facilities has a significant effect on the cost of manufacturing 
key variable costs include costs of raw materials  including scrap steel  steel slabs  electricity  and natural gas 
steel has entered into certain marketing alliances and manufacturing arrangements with unrelated companies involving the processing of flat rolled steel provided by steel into tubular products which provides steel access to additional manufacturing capacity 
the completion of steel s expansion of its specialty tubing facility gives it what it believes to be the largest dom manufacturing capacity within the united states 
with the placement of orders for steel coil slitting and handling equipment  commitments under steel s to million capital expenditure program are substantially completed 
this equipment is intended to give steel the ability to obtain and use a wider range of coils in its production process  thereby increasing steel s flexibility in procuring the most economical raw materials 
steel is embarking on a new capital expenditure program for approximately million designed to improve quality and lower costs and intends to implement this program in the to period with financing obtained from operating cash flows and available borrowings under steel s revolving credit facility 
results of operations consolidated revenues reported in the statements of earnings are as follows in millions oilfield products revenues specialty tubing products revenues flat rolled steel and other tubular revenues consolidated net revenues shipments of products by segment are as follows in tons oilfield products    specialty tubing products    flat rolled steel and other tubular products    total tons shipped    compared with net revenues increased to million in from million in net revenues of oilfield products increased to in from million in shipment volumes and prices increased in from levels by and  respectively  as the average domestic rig count increased to in from in as in  demand for steel s octg was favorably impacted due to the reduction in imported octg resulting from the continuation of protective tariffs on imported products from certain countries  and by the types of drilling being conducted  such as deep water drilling in the gulf of mexico  which increased the industry s requirements for larger diameter  higher grade products for which steel is most competitive 
specialty tubing products net revenues decreased by to million in from million in primarily attributable to weak demand from steel service centers which was partially offset by increased demand from automobile manufacturers 
for the specialty tubing product group  shipment volume and price decreased by and  respectively 
flat rolled and other tubular products net revenues were down to million in from million in due to lower average selling prices 
gross earnings improved to million in from million in this was attributable to increased shipments and prices of oilfield products and a decrease in the cost of steel slabs 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to additional sales expenses as product sales increased and additional spending to modernize management information systems 
interest income was million less in than in as short term interest rates were lower on the average in than in interest expense for decreased million from million in  reflecting average lower borrowings in on steel s revolving credit facility compared to other income  net 
net other loss in consisted of miscellaneous items totaling of million 
net other income in was million and included million from the gain on sale of approximately  acres of land in east texas 
net earnings for were million or earnings per share 
earnings from continuing operations were million for for  net earnings and earnings from continuous operations were both million or earnings per share 
compared with net revenues increased to million in from million in oilfield products revenues increased to in from million in although the average domestic rig count declined to in from in  shipment volumes and prices increased in from levels by and  respectively 
specialty tubing products net revenues increased to million in from million in as volumes increased and prices improved in these increases were due to improvement in the domestic general economy 
flat rolled and other tubular products net revenues were up in to million from million in due to higher average selling prices 
gross earnings improved to million in from million in this was primarily attributable to increased shipments and prices of oilfield and specialty tubing products 
however  increases in raw materials  principally a increase in the cost of scrap steel and steel slabs  offset some of these margin improvements 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower legal and consulting fees 
interest income was million more in than in as short term interest rates were higher on the average in than in interest expense for increased to million from million in  reflecting higher interest rates in on steel s revolving credit facility

net earnings and earnings from continuing operations for were both million or earnings per share 
for  there was a loss from continuing operations of million  or loss per share 
after a million gain on sale of discontinued operations  net earnings in were million  and after a per share downward adjustment for the redemption of preferred stock  the amount available to common shareholders was a net loss per share 
financial condition and liquidity lst has no direct business operations other than steel or significant sources of cash other than from short term investments or the sale of securities 
steel is restricted from paying cash dividends under terms of its revolving credit agreement  however  lst is reimbursed by steel for a portion of its operating costs as provided by its cost sharing agreement with steel 
at december   lst had available cash  short term investments and marketable securities totaling million 
these available funds were reduced in january when lst acquired all of the outstanding common stock  preferred stock and warrants held by other shareholders of steel for million in cash  making steel a wholly owned subsidiary of lst 
as a result all  outstanding common shares of steel are owned by lst 
as of january  all outstanding shares of steel s series a preferred stock are owned by lst 
this stock has a stated value of  per share and pays dividends quarterly at a rate of per year 
the preferred stock is required to be redeemed by steel  unless earlier redeemed or converted  on january   in cash  at the designated value plus any unpaid dividends 
prior to redemption of the stock  dividends may be paid in cash  although currently prohibited by the terms of the revolving credit agreement  or in additional preferred shares  which is permitted 
to date  quarterly dividends have been paid in additional preferred shares 
these preferred shares are convertible into steel common stock prior to redemption at the rate of one share of common stock for each  of designated value subject to antidilution provisions 
lst periodically purchases steel slabs which are consigned to steel for use in its production process and thereby affords steel somewhat longer payment periods for this raw material 
steel pays lst as the slabs are used 
this program s structure is consistent with those previously established with third parties 
during  lst s slab purchases amounted to approximately million 
in november  lst sold the stock of afb  one of its operating subsidiaries  to guaranty federal bank  fsb gfb 
the sale price was million  of that  lst received million in cash on the date of the sale and million in november and million remains in escrow to pay for certain claims that may be made by gfb pursuant to the sale agreement 
to date  lst has not paid any claims  but approximately million in claims are pending 
revenue recognition on the escrowed amounts has been deferred and will be recognized as gain from discontinued operations as funds are released from escrow 
steel requires capital primarily to fund general working capital needs and capital expenditures 
principal sources of funds include cash generated by operations and borrowings 
steel has a revolving credit agreement under which it can borrow the lesser of million or an amount based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventories that secure the borrowings 
the credit line will increase by million in march and march at december   borrowings totaled million on an available borrowing base of million 
the interest rate on borrowings was prime plus which  at year end  was 
the interest rate will reduce to over the prime rate effective february steel also pays a fee of on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the agreement  which extends to march  contains various restrictive covenants  including requirements to maintain minimum net worth levels and meet other financial ratios 
steel believes that funds generated by operations and its borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement will provide the liquidity necessary to fund its cash requirements during lst has outstanding million  convertible subordinated debentures which are due in and may be converted at any time into shares of lst common stock at the holders option 
the conversion price is per share  subject to antidilution provisions 
steel s operations are subject to restrictive environmental compliance and permitting requirements of various governmental agencies that include the tnrcc and the epa 
steel has entered into specific agreements with these agencies to conduct numerous environmental studies and to develop plans to ensure continuous compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
steel believes that the cost of maintaining compliance with environmental requirements will fall within its contemplated operating and capital expenditure plans  averaging million annually in the foreseeable future
