results of operations continued general operating environment dresser is a fully integrated manufacturer and supplier of products and services to customers in the oil and gas industry 
the company produces a broad range of highly engineered products for hydrocarbon exploration  drilling  production  transmission and processing activities 
dresser also provides engineering  procurement and project management services for all aspects of the energy business 
operations are organized into three segments petroleum products and services  engineering services and energy equipment 
descriptions of the segments are contained in note n to consolidated financial statements 
the business environment for petroleum products and services is directly affected by prices for oil and natural gas  drilling activity and exploration and production spending by oil and natural gas producers 
in  the average posted price of west texas intermediate crude oil rose approximately to per barrel while the average spot price of natural gas increased to per million btus 
overall  the rig count rose in fiscal the rig count in north america was up  primarily reflecting an increase in wells drilled for natural gas  while the rig count in international markets increased  reflecting higher activity levels in major producing regions like latin america  the middle east  africa  the north sea and the gulf of mexico 
the global offshore rig count was up 
the business environment for engineering services and energy equipment is effected by numerous factors  including global and regional economic growth rates  the prices of oil and natural gas  the supply and demand for products created from hydrocarbons including gasoline  jet fuel  ethylene  petrochemicals  chemicals  fertilizers and power 
these factors determine the capital spending budgets  both upstream and downstream  of integrated oil and gas companies around the world 
according to published sources  economic growth is expected to continue at an average of for developing countries and for developed countries 
developing country growth expectations are due largely to steadily increasing population and greater industrialization that will also generate rising per capita energy demand 
increasing consumption of oil and natural gas is expected to be driven by rising demand for refined products  petrochemicals  fertilizers and power 
capital and maintenance spending for downstream hydrocarbon processing projects is expected to increase to billion in  up from a projected billion in recent project award activity has increased for petrochemical chemical projects 
global project activity in hit its highest level over  projects since  led by international project activity  particularly in the far east and europe 
results of operations continued consolidated results compared to earnings per share and net earnings of and million for were up and  respectively  from and million in before an accounting change 
the earnings improvement reflects the substantial growth seen in the global market for oil and gas and their by products 
revenues for were billion  an increase of over the billion in segment operating profit was million in compared to million in for a increase 
all three industry segments had higher revenues and operating profit 
within the segments  all operations had higher revenues with virtually all operations showing improvement 
see the industry segment analysis for discussion of results by operation 
general corporate expenses of million were million higher than in the higher level of expenses in was primarily due to i foreign exchange losses on devaluations of the venezuelan currency in december and april and ii costs of hedging the company s investment in an italian subsidiary 
higher benefit related expenses in also contributed to the increase 
interest expense increased to million in from million in due to an increase in total borrowings and to the higher interest rate on new long term debt versus the previously issued commercial paper 
interest income decreased to million in from million in due to a lower level of short term investment of excess funds 
the effective income tax rate for was compared to for the increased rate reflects a lower level of utilization of foreign net operating losses 
compared to net earnings in before the accounting change were million per share compared to million per share in excluding the effect of the special items discussed above 
this represents a earnings per share increase 
revenues of billion were up million or over segment operating profit of million increased million or from the petroleum products and services segment and the energy equipment segment were up while the engineering services segment was down versus results of operations continued consolidated results continued compared to continued see the industry segment analysis for discussion of changes in revenues and operating profit 
general corporate expenses of million were million higher than in the increase was primarily due to gains on sales of interests in m i drilling fluids company and iri international corporation 
net interest expense increased million to million primarily because of lower interest income due to a lower level of short term investments 
the effective income tax rate for was compared to an overall rate of in in  a lower tax basis on the investment in western atlas international  inc  compared to the book basis  resulted in a tax charge of million or on the book gain on sale 
the additional taxes on the gain on sale of western atlas were somewhat offset by the million of special tax benefits recognized upon sale of investment in iri international corporation 
excluding these two transactions  the effective rate for was 
minority interest provision was million  down million from the decrease was primarily attributable to the share in lower earnings of dresser rand 
industry segment analysis see details of financial information by industry segment and geographic area on pages through petroleum products and services drilling and production operations revenues of billion in were higher than  and operating profit of million was up over the prior year 
sales to customers outside of the us accounted for of total sales  slightly higher than  with strong growth in latin america  europe and africa 
particularly strong gains were experienced by baroid drilling fluids  sperry sun drilling services and security dbs 
baroid s revenues increased over as it capitalized on the growth of higher quality wells being drilled  particularly offshore deepwater wells 
market share gains in the gulf of mexico  latin america and west africa also contributed to the exceptional growth over sperry sun revenues were higher than with key growth areas including the gulf of mexico  the north sea and latin america 
increases in capital spending for measurement while drilling tools and a continuation of high utilization rates were seen during the year 
security dbs revenues and operating profit increased in over as the result of increased sales of higher margin fixed cutter bits  combined with cost improvements obtained from manufacturing efficiencies in its us plants 
for total drilling and production operations  the ratio of operating profit to sales was compared to last year 
results of operations continued industry segment analysis continued petroleum products and services drilling and production operations continued revenues of billion in were million or higher than levels 
excluding the revenues of m i drilling fluids  which was sold in february  revenues increased million or 
operating profit of million was million higher than excluding the impact of m i drilling fluids  operating profit increased million or over the operating margin improved to of sales from in or excluding m i 
all geographic sectors improved in  in particular latin america and the north sea where drilling activity was greater than in the prior fiscal year 
although each operating division improved  the majority of the gains in sales and operating profit were attributable to baroid drilling fluids and sperry sun drilling services 
baroid revenues increased due to higher activity in major producing regions including the north sea  latin america and the gulf of mexico 
in addition  new market penetration of products developed within the last five years  including petrofree and dril n drilling systems  contributed to the performance 
sperry sun s revenues improved  reflecting increasing demand  coupled with higher system capacity and utilization rates  for measurement while drilling and directional drilling services in most major markets 
in addition  new products including slim phase  lateral tie back system ltbs and underbalanced drilling contributed to the improvement 
revenues for security dbs rose  reflecting an increase in international sales of roller cone drill bits 
operating profit improved significantly  reflecting successful restructuring and manufacturing cycle time reductions 
dresser oil tools benefited from strong sales in canada and international markets as well as cost savings from the consolidation of manufacturing and sales and distribution operations 
new product introductions also contributed to the improvement 
despite a weak canadian market  the dresser wheatley division benefited from the marketing of additional dresser products 
kellogg oil and gas services revenues of million and operating profit of million were and higher  respectively  in compared to the bredero shaw pipecoating operations saw substantial increases during the year  primarily from a large contract in the norwegian sector of the north sea that was awarded in the latter part of activity also increased in us markets as the result of an acquisition made in although sub sea revenues grew in compared to  earnings declined as the result of poor lay barge utilization and day rates in the gulf of mexico and soft market conditions in the middle east 
results of operations continued industry segment analysis continued petroleum products and services continued kellogg oil and gas services continued wellstream  acquired in mid  was profitable in its first full year of operation and is seeing improved demand for its flexible pipe and riser systems 
to meet this demand  a new plant is being constructed in the uk which will enable wellstream to expand its product lines and double its existing capacity 
revenues and operating profit declined million and million  respectively  in compared to a cyclical downturn in the bredero price pipecoating business in the north sea and the far east resulted in significantly lower revenues and operating profit in the sub sea underwater engineering operations had higher revenues and operating profit in as the result of improvements in both the north sea and gulf of mexico  combined with the impact of acquisitions made during engineering services m

kellogg revenues of billion were higher than  and operating profit of million was higher 
these gains resulted from higher activity on projects in the uk  uzbekistan  africa and the uk the successful completion of significant milestones on several large contracts also contributed to the higher profit levels 
a number of significant projects commenced during the year for lng  fertilizer and petrochemical production 
m

kellogg revenues of billion in rose from billion in major improvement in activity occurred in north america  latin america and europe 
these gains were partially offset by lower activity in the far east  reflecting the wind down of projects in malaysia  africa and the middle east 
petrochemicals and gas processing activity accounted for much of the pick up in activity in the united states and europe 
m

kellogg operating profit in declined due principally to lower equity income of million from mw kellogg s investment in bufete industriale  sa de sa  a major mexican engineering and construction firm 
operating profit for also included a gain of million from the sale of one third of its investment in bufete  and the results included a gain of million associated with an initial public offering of bufete 
excluding the impact of bufete  operating profit in increased 
backlog of billion at october  was more than double the year ago level of billion  reflecting increases in lng  fertilizer  ethylene and enhanced oil recovery project bookings 
results of operations continued industry segment analysis continued energy equipment compression and pumping compression and pumping revenues of billion were higher than operating profit of million was higher than the prior year 
dresser rand s earnings of million were up from last year on approximately higher sales 
the increase in earnings reflects higher complete machine  aftermarket and contract compression sales  and reduced sales of lower margin purchased equipment 
lower manufacturing overhead and selling  general and administrative expenses also aided the earnings improvement 
revenues and operating profit both fell approximately in compared to dresser rand revenues declined million or to billion as a cyclical downturn in the compression industry resulted in lower volumes of complete units and repair parts during the first half of the year and from the impact of a major multi year gas compression project in venezuela that was completed early in fiscal in  of dresser rand s revenues were from markets outside of north america 
an increase in revenues in the united states and the far east was more than offset by declines attributable to the factors noted above 
dresser rand operating profit of million was down million from all markets were affected by margin pressure on complete unit sales  especially the far east 
cost reduction programs and the benefits associated with higher levels of production during the year partially offset the decline in margin 
earnings from the owned ingersoll dresser pump idp joint venture were million in  million in and million in the improvement in over and was driven by margin improvements and continuing improvements to its cost structure since the formation of the joint venture 
measurement revenues of million in were million or higher than in  however  operating profit of million was million or lower than in the operating profit decrease occurred in the wayne fuel dispensing division due to pricing pressures in the us and increased software development costs 
the improvement in the instrument division primarily reflected the contribution of an acquisition in early measurement operation revenues of million in were million or higher than levels 
however  operating profit was essentially unchanged at million compared to million in although the wayne division enjoyed improved sales in europe and south america  margins were negatively impacted by cost and pricing pressures in the us market  resulting in lower overall operating profit in the instrument division reported a revenue increase and a slight improvement in operating profit 
earnings from higher activity in south america and new product introductions were offset by a decline in europe and the effect of increased spending in the marketing and research and development areas 
results of operations continued industry segment analysis continued flow control in  revenues of million and operating profit of million were up from by million or and million or  respectively 
the increases were primarily attributable to the inclusion in the energy valve division of a full year s results for grove spa  which was acquired in june  as well as the beneficial impact of higher activity in its us operations 
the valve and controls division showed improvement with volume growth associated with increased activity in the refining  chemical and power sectors as well as the ongoing benefits associated with the restructuring of its european operations 
flow control revenues of million were million or higher than operating profit of million was million or higher than the acquisition of grove spa in june was the major reason for the year to year increase in revenues and operating profit 
the valve and controls division performed ahead of as a result of increased project related orders in and the cost savings realized from the restructuring in europe 
power systems revenues of million in showed a million or increase over while operating profit of million increased million or over both the waukesha and roots divisions had volume increases 
roots contributed most of the operating profit improvement 
price discounting and early year softness in gas compression markets pressured waukesha s operating profit in the first half of the year 
a pick up in us and international activity contributed to a modest recovery in the second half of fiscal power systems operations operating profit improved in on a revenue increase 
waukesha division revenues of million increased million or  with a slight improvement in operating profit 
the sales improvement was primarily in the lower margin power generation market  and higher new product development costs also impacted operating profit in the roots division saw operating profit improve million on essentially flat sales of million 
the earnings improvement was primarily the result of a major reengineering effort to improve its manufacturing cost structure during the year
