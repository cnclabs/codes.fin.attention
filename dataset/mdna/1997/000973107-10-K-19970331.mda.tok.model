fluctuations in net sales and operating results the company s future operating results may be affected by a number of factors such as the level and timing of orders from  and shipments to  major customers  customers announcement and introduction of new products or new generations of products  evolutions in the life cycles of customers products  timing of expenditures in anticipation of future orders  effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes  changes in cost and availability of labor and components  a shift in the company s product and service mix which results in fluctuating margins  and changes or anticipated changes in economic conditions 
cautionary statements the private securities litigation reform act of the act contains certain safe harbors regarding forward looking statements 
from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information which involve risk and uncertainties 
any statements in this report that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements including  but not limited to  statements concerning the characteristics and growth of the company s market and customers  the company s objectives and plans for future operations  and the company s expected liquidity and capital resources 
the following cautionary statements should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
the factors discussed in these cautionary statements  among other factors  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements made in this annual report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
these cautionary statements are being made pursuant to the provisions of the act and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
reference is also made to the risk factors described in the company s prospectus dated march  customer and industry concentration for fiscal  the company s four largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales 
sales to cascade communications  com  bay networks and motorola were approximately   and  respectively  of the company s net sales for fiscal the company s results will depend to a significant extent on the success achieved by its oem customers in marketing their products and the company s ability to diversify its customer base in order to reduce its reliance on its major customers 
there can be no assurance that the company s principal customers will continue to purchase products and services from the company at current levels 
the loss of one or more major customers  a significant reduction in purchases from such customers  or developments adverse to the company s customers or their products could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in addition  while the company has not experienced any difficulty in being paid by its major customers in recent years  the company could be adversely affected if a major customer were unable or unwilling to pay for products and services 
the company s customer base has historically been concentrated in a limited number of industries  most of which are subject to high competition  rapid technological changes and consequent product obsolescence 
developments adverse to such industries could have a negative effect on the company 
the industries served by the company are also subject to economic cycles and have in the past experienced  and are likely in the future to experience  recessionary periods 
a recessionary period affecting one or more of the industry segments served by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected due to a slowing of the manufacturing outsourcing trend 
variability of customer requirements  nature and extent of customer commitments on orders the level and timing of orders placed by the company s oem customers vary due to customer attempts to manage inventory  changes in the oem s manufacturing strategy and variation in demand for customer products due to  among other things  introduction of new products  product life cycles  competitive conditions or general economic conditions 
the company generally does not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments but instead works with its customers to anticipate the future volume of orders 
based on such anticipated future volumes  the company makes other significant commitments regarding the levels of business that it will seek and accept  the timing of production schedules and the levels and utilization of personnel and other resources 
from time to time  the company will purchase components without a customer commitment to pay for them 
a variety of conditions  both specific to the individual customer and generally affecting the customer s industry  may cause customers to cancel  reduce or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated 
generally  customers may cancel  reduce or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty 
significant cancellations  reductions or delays in orders by a customer or group of customers could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
fluctuations in operating results the variability of the level and timing of orders from  and shipments to  major customers may result in significant periodic and quarterly fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
in addition to the variability resulting from the short term nature of its customers commitments  other factors have contributed  and may in the future contribute  to such fluctuations 
these factors include  among other things  customers announcement and introduction of new products or new generations of products  evolutions in the life cycles of customers products  timing of expenditures in anticipation of future orders  effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes  changes in cost and availability of labor and components  a shift in the company s product and service mix which results in fluctuating margins  and changes or anticipated changes in economic conditions 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  any unanticipated shortfall in revenue in a quarter may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations for that quarter 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
availability of key components the company and many of its customers rely on a single or limited number of third party suppliers for many components used in the assembly process 
shortages of certain electronic components  including certain memory modules and logic devices  have occurred from time to time 
in addition  due to the company s utilization of just in time inventory techniques  the timely availability of many components to the company is dependent on the company s ability to continuously develop accurate forecasts of customer volume requirements 
component shortages could result in manufacturing and shipping delays or increased component prices which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
because the company purchases a significant number of components manufactured in foreign countries  it is subject to numerous risks  including economic disruptions  transportation delays and interruptions  foreign exchange rate fluctuations  imposition of tariffs and import and export controls and changes in governmental policies  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company has historically been able to enter into advantageous arrangements from time to time for the supply of certain limited availability components 
to the extent that the company is unable to source key components for the reasons cited above or otherwise  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
technological change and process development the market for the company s manufacturing services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development 
the continued success of the company s business will depend in large part upon its ability to maintain and enhance its technological capabilities  develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although management believes that the company s operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies and equipment currently required by the company s customers  there can be no assurance that the company s process development efforts will be successful or that the emergence of new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements will not render the company s technology  equipment or processes obsolete or uncompetitive 
in addition  to the extent that the company determines that new assembly and testing technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the acquisition and implementation of such technologies and equipment are likely to require significant capital investment by the company 
competition the commercial electronics contract manufacturing industry is a highly competitive industry 
the company competes against numerous domestic and foreign contract manufacturers 
the company s major competitors in the pcb assembly business include solectron corporation  sci systems  inc  jabil circuit  inc  lockheed martin commercial electronics  the dii group  group technologies corporation  benchmark electronics  inc and sanmina corporation 
the company faces competition in the cable and harness assembly market primarily from volex interconnect systems  inc  berg electronics  inc  amp  inc and molex  inc 
the company also faces competition from a number of local and regional contract manufacturers 
in addition  current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally and certain large oems will from time to time offer contract manufacturing services in order to utilize excess capacity 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater manufacturing  financial and marketing resources than the company 
the company may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to manufacturers who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers or who have lower cost structures  particularly those with significant offshore operations 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in the segments of the contract manufacturing industry in which it operates are technology  service  manufacturing capability  quality  regional access  price  reliability  timeliness and flexibility 
there can be no assurance that competition from existing or potential competitors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
management of growth the company has grown rapidly in recent years 
a continuing period of rapid growth could place a significant strain on the company s management  operations and other resources 
the company s ability to manage its growth will require it to continue to invest in its operational  financial and management information systems  and to retain  motivate and effectively manage its employees 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the quality of the company s services and products  its ability to retain key personnel and its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
dependence upon key personnel the company s continued success been largely dependent upon the skills and efforts of john a 
pino  its president and chief executive officer  and other key employees 
none of the senior management or other key employees of the company is subject to any employment contract 
the loss of services of any of its officers or other key personnel could have an adverse effect on the operations of the company 
in addition  continued growth and development of the company will require that  despite significant competition  it attract  motivate and retain additional skilled and experienced personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract  motivate and retain personnel with the skills and experience needed to successfully manage the company s business and operations 
concentration of printed circuit board business in northeastern united states the company s pcb assemblies and related services are primarily marketed and sold to customers operating in the northeastern united states 
the company attempts to mitigate any unique exposure to the northeastern united states economy by marketing to oems which deliver products to national and international markets  but there can be no assurance that an economic downturn or recession in the northeastern united states would not have an adverse effect on the company 
future acquisitions and geographical expansion the company may expand into other geographical areas within the united states and internationally by acquiring contract manufacturing businesses or by establishing new manufacturing operations in such areas 
the company may compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with entities having significantly greater resources than the company 
any such transactions may result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  and other costs and expenses  all of which could materially adversely affect the company s financial results following such a transaction 
such transactions also involve numerous business risk  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of key employees from the combined company 
in the event that any such transaction does occur  there can be no assurance as to the beneficial effect on the company s business and financial results 
environmental compliance the company is subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during its manufacturing process 
a failure by the company to comply with present and future regulations could subject it to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
such regulations could also restrict the company s ability to expand its facilities or could require the company to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
possible volatility of stock price there has been significant volatility in the market price of securities of high technology companies 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations by the company  its competitors and other third parties  as well as quarterly variations in the company s results of operations and market conditions in the industry  may cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate significantly 
in addition  the public stock markets have historically experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock
