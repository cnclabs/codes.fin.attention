item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained herein 
over the course of the last three years  the company has acquired the rights to a number of technologies from brigham young university byu  either directly from byu or indirectly through its acquisition of sensar 
these technologies have placed the company in a position to develop a number of sophisticated analytical instruments in addition to its historical acoustical and vibration based business 
the company believes that the patented technology it has acquired will permit it to develop instruments that are technically superior to those currently being offered  that will be on the cutting edge of certain emerging markets  that will address needs in certain industries in a more cost efficient manner  and that can be sold at prices less than alternative solutions currently being offered 
in order to accomplish its goals  the company initiated a research and development plan designed to convert the underlying technologies into commercial products 
these efforts are just beginning to lead to products and have not had a significant impact on the revenues of the company to date 
the company does not anticipate that there will be a significant impact until at least the third or fourth quarter of fiscal the products currently being worked on by the company are designed for extremely sophisticated applications  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its development efforts or that alternative technologies may not be developed by some other entity that provide a more advantageous solution to the needs of the various industries targeted by the company 
in order to obtain the necessary funding to implement its research and development plan  the company has sought equity financing  primarily from a small number of private investors 
the company received net proceeds from the issuance of common stock from private placements  and from the exercise of warrants and options of  in the year ended june    in the year ended june   and  in the six months ended december  since december   the company has received gross proceeds of  from the exercise of warrants 
this capital has been used for various purposes  including increased research and development activities  the reduction of the company s operating line of credit  and general operations 
management intends to use only funds available from non operating and non debt sources to continue product development in excess of historical research and development levels 
as of march   the company has issued and outstanding warrants to acquire  shares of common stock which would yield gross proceeds to the company of  if fully exercised 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note m stock options and warrants and note u subsequent events 
the holders of such warrants have no obligation to exercise the warrants and the decision to do so will be largely dependent on the trading price for the company s common stock in the public market  about which no assurances can be given 
however  if the holders do elect to exercise the warrants  management would use the funds to pay for the planned products and to further accelerate development activities 
new product development  prototype manufacture  and first production costs adversely affected the results of operations of the company in the six months ended december   and the year ended june  these activities generated expenses with no corresponding revenues 
it is anticipated the company will continue to experience operating losses until new products are brought to market and begin to generate significant sales 
there can be no assurance as to the timing of these products being brought to market or as to the success of the products 
if unsuccessful  the company would not be able to recover its associated research and development costs  which would have a significant material adverse impact on the business and activities of the company 
discontinued operations in a transaction completed august   the company entered into an agreement to divest its airport noise monitoring business 
as a result  the company is no longer a general contractor for these systems  although it still manufactures and sells acoustic instrumentation used in the systems 
under the terms of the agreement  harris miller miller hanson  inc hmmh  an established consulting firm with its primary business related to transportation industry acoustic and vibration analysis  purchased essentially all of the company s assets and contracts related to the airport noise monitoring business and assumed approximately  of the company s liabilities 
the company discontinued operations in this area and agreed not to compete with hmmh 
hmmh agreed to use its best efforts to utilize the company s instrumentation in future contracts and receives most favored nations treatment from the company in pricing 
the company was paid a one time fee and is entitled to varying royalty payments over the life of the agreement 
during the period this agreement has been in effect through december   the company received or accrued amounts due with respect to this transaction of  see notes to consolidated financial statements  note q discontinued operations 
these amounts were offset against the carrying value of associated assets reflected on the balance sheet of the company under the caption long term contractual arrangement 
results of operations comparison of six months ended december   and net sales net sales from continuing operations for the six months ended december   and  were  and  respectively 
this represents an increase of  or  for as compared to the acquisition of sensar occurred october  as such  the operations of sensar are included for the entire six month period ended december   while the operations of sensar were only included for approximately two months of the six month period ended december  the increase in sales is principally due to increased revenue from sensar products of approximately  the remaining increase of approximately  represented a increase in the sales of acoustical and vibration instrumentation 
during the six months ended december   export sales experienced a significant increase as a percentage of total sales  to of sales 
this growth is due to a continuing increase in sales to the pacific rim and increases in sales in europe  compared to the prior period 
domestic sales  on an annualized basis  declined compared to the prior year  but have increased compared to and cost of sales and operating expenses cost of sales and operating expenses for the six months ended december   were  or of net sales  compared to  or of sales  for the six months ended december  this elevated level of cost compared to historical levels continues principally due to high cost of materials  initial production costs  and development costs associated with production of initial sensar products 
management expects the cost of sales as a percentage of sales to decline in the future to a level more consistent with historical levels prior to the sensar acquisition 
this should occur when the sensar products are ready for market  product demand is achieved  and standard production processes are established  although this result cannot yet be assured because the company continues to have limited production experience with these products to date 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from for the six months ended december   to for the corresponding period of the increase was due to several factors  including increased audit  legal  and consulting fees  establishment of a new european sales manager  and increased costs related to various corporate and marketing activities 
management believes that some of these costs incurred in the period ended december   were non recurring in nature  and that selling  general  and administrative expenses should decline in the future to be more consistent with historical levels  although no assurance can be made that the company will be successful in reducing such expenses 
research and development for the six months ended december   research and development costs were  or of net sales  compared to  or of net sales  for the six months ended december  the increase over the prior period  as well as increases above historical levels  is reflective of the company s continuing commitment to the development of new products 
see item business sensar technology and crosscheck technology 
it is anticipated that research and development costs will continue to exceed historical levels as a percentage of sales until the development of new products is completed and significant sales levels of the new products are achieved 
historical levels of research and development costs as a percentage of sales for the fiscal years ended june  to have averaged approximately of sales 
comparison of years ended june   and net sales net sales from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended june   and  were  and  respectively 
this was the second consecutive year in which the company posted an approximate increase in its acoustic and vibration instrumentation sales 
the increased sales were attributable to a general expansion of the underlying market  and an increase in the unit sales of the company s products 
the acquisition of sensar on october   did not materially impact the net sales for the year ended june   with approximately  in revenue attributable to the sensar operations during that period 
during  export sales declined from to of total sales 
this decline was the result of decreased sales in europe  but was also due to strong sales increases domestically 
cost of sales and operating expenses the company s cost of sales and operating expenses of  in the year ended june   and  in the year ended june   increased as a percentage of sales from continuing operations to from 
the increase in is due primarily to the high cost of materials  initial production costs  and development costs associated with production of initial sensar products 
prior to the company s acquisition  sensar purchased major electronics subsystems from a third party 
the pricing structure was based on the premise of a high price for a limited number of systems to provide the manufacturer a way to recover development costs 
since the acquisition of sensar  the company has designed a replacement subsystem which reduced the cost of the electronics for this component by approximately 
because of the use of the remaining highly priced electronics subsystems in sensar s inventory in fiscal year june   the entire material and development costs were expensed during the period 
cost of sales and operating expenses in the future for the sensar products are expected to decrease as production becomes standardized  although this result cannot be assured since the company has only limited production experience with these products to date 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses remained relatively constant as a percentage of sales for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  selling  general  and administrative expenses were  or of net sales  for the year ended june  this represents a small decline when compared to the year ended june   when selling  general  and administrative expenses were  or of net sales 
research and development the company is involved in a high tech industry which demands constant improvements and development of its instrumentation to remain technically viable 
since its inception  the company has dedicated significant operating funds to research and development 
for the five fiscal years june  to  research and development expenses have averaged approximately of net sales and in the year ended june   were  or approximately of net sales 
the historical level of research and development commitment was factored into the pricing structure for the company s products 
for the fiscal year ended june   research and development expenses were  approximately of net sales 
this level of research and development reflects management s commitment to develop new products to enhance the revenue potential of the company 
see item business sensar technology and crosscheck technology 
capital obtained from the sale of common stock was used to supplement the company s operations as a method for funding this accelerated research and development 
comparison of years ended june   and net sales net sales from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended june   and  increased to  from  respectively 
sales levels had declined in related  in part  to a general global recession 
the company was able to maintain its established market share in a then shrinking market 
in the fiscal year ended june   sales increased by from as compared to foreign sales have been an important part of the company s business plan for many years 
for the fiscal years ended june   and  foreign sales as a portion of continuing operations accounted for and  respectively 
the increase in was partially due to the registrant s operations in the united kingdom through its subsidiary  ltd 
cost of sales and operating expenses the company s cost of sales and operating expenses as a percentage of sales from continuing operations for the years ended june   and  were and  respectively 
the company believes its efforts to better track costs and control inventories contributed to the decrease in cost of sales and operating expenses between the fiscal years ended june   and selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of sales for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  selling  general  and administrative expenses were  or of net sales  for the year ended june   compared to  or of net sales  for the year ended june  the decline was largely related to the fact that in  significant general and administrative expenses were incurred related to two acquisitions 
similar expenses were not incurred in research and development since its inception  the company dedicated significant operating funds to research and development 
for the years ended june   and  this commitment represented and  respectively  of the company s net sales from continuing operations 
the company introduced a number of new products in which caused the increased spending reflected in the fiscal year ended june  the development period for products introduced in 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had total current assets of  and total current liabilities of  resulting in working capital of  and a working capital ratio of included in total current liabilities is the company s revolving line of credit with a balance of  during the six months ended december   the company s principal line of credit was placed with a new financial institution 
the maximum limit on this line of credit has been increased to  but is adjusted from time to time based on the amount of inventories and accounts receivable that secure the line of credit 
the company is in the first year of a three year agreement 
the company anticipates the line of credit will continue to remain available to it 
the company has relied on the sale of common stock as a method to fund increases in accounts receivable and inventories  operational losses  and research and development efforts 
during the six months ended december   and the year ended june   the company used  and  respectively  in operating activities 
the company anticipates it will continue to rely on equity funding in the future 
the company received net proceeds from the issuance of common stock on the exercise of warrants and options in the net amount of  during the six months ended december   and  during the fiscal year ended june  subsequent to december   the company has received gross proceeds from the exercise of warrants for  shares of common stock in the amount of  there are currently issued and outstanding warrants with respect to  shares of common stock 
if all of these warrants were exercised  the company would receive gross proceeds of  in additional funding 
on the satisfaction of certain conditions  the company has agreed to issue additional warrants to acquire up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
there is no obligation of the holders of these rights to exercise them and the exercise will largely depend on the price of the company s common stock in the public trading market  as to which no assurance can be given 
in the opinion of management  current cash balances  funds available under the line of credit  and anticipated proceeds from exercise of warrants will provide the company with sufficient capital to fund its operations and development plans for the calendar year
