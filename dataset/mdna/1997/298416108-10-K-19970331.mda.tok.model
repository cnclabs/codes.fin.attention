item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company develops  manufactures and markets digitally controlled audio mixing consoles for the use in the production of audio content for the music  post production film and television  broadcast  live sound reinforcement live concerts and theater and multimedia segments of the professional audio market 
from its inception in july through  the company was princi pally engaged in product research and development 
in late  the company began shipping its first commercial product in the united states and interna tionally 
the company has funded its growth primarily through sales of equity securities in  and  and cash generated from operations in and in  million was used in the company s operating activities 
as of december   the company has shipped approximately of its mixing consoles worldwide 
the price of the company s mixing consoles generally ranges from  to  and is often the most expensive piece of equipment in the studio 
products are typically delivered two to three months after receipt of an order 
prior to shipping a product  the company generally requires payment of a sub stantial portion of the purchase price  an irrevocable letter of credit or a purchase order from a third party lessor 
the company usually relies on new orders in the same quarter to achieve its net revenues 
the company recognizes its revenues on shipment

total operating expenses operating loss income interest income  net loss income before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss income net revenues net revenues increased to million in  from million in and million in  representing increases of and  respectively 
the company s annual increases in net revenues have resulted primarily from increased sales efforts  increased market acceptance and enhanced product capabilities of the company s mixing consoles 
in addition during the company acquired spectral which contributed million or of net revenue from the date of acquisition through december  sales of the company s products in the united states were million  million and million  comprising approximately  and of the company s net revenues for  and  respectively 
export sales were million  million and million  comprising approximately  and of the company s net revenues for  and  respectively 
in compared with new markets were entered with first time sales in korea  netherlands  new zealand  denmark  sweden  brazil  argentina and south africa 
the company believes that export sales as a percent of net revenues were low in due in part to poor econom ic conditions in japan and certain major european countries  as well as the lack of a significant international market presence of the company until late and the company s focus on the united states market 
substantially all sales are denominated in united states dollars to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company continues to make progress in the sales of audio mixing systems  however  there were a number of significant factors which the company believes impacted the third and fourth quarter results and may adversely impact the company s results 
these factors included a slower than antici pated product penetration into the post production and broadcast markets  new competitive product offerings  and a slow down in domestic and european indus try markets 
page of gross margin the company s gross margin increased to in  up from in and down from in the decrease in from reflected an increase in export sales  which includes greater discounts to distributors 
the increase in from was primarily attributable to lower material procurement and manufacturing support costs  as a percentage of net revenues for the same period 
in addition during the company acquired spectral whose products have a higher gross margin percentage than the consoles 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in  up from million in  and million in  representing an increase of in  and an increase of in research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to in  up from in  and in the increase in research and development expenses from was primarily due to the development of a number of product enhancements and in from was primarily due to the addi tion of spectral  incorporated engineering personnel 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to million in  from million in  and million in  representing increases of and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses also increased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in  and from in the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues in was primarily attributable to the addition of spectral incorp orated sales and marketing personnel 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  and  in  representing increases of and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses as a percent of net revenues increased to in from in  and from in  respectively 
the increases in and are primarily due to increases in number of personnel and staffing costs and the addition of report ing  legal and accounting requirements of a publicly traded company 
in process technology write off of intangibles and goodwill in connection with the acquisition of spectral  euphonix recorded a charge for in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future uses 
this one time charge amounted to million during the first quarter of in the fourth quarter of the unamortized capitalized technology and goodwill was charged to expense  due to new products being planned and developed which will address the high end digital audio workstation daw and recorder markets that do not include spectral s existing technology 
in addition spectral s existing technology has no alternative future uses 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate in was  excluding the effects of a one time in process technology write off for which no tax benefit is avail able 
the company s effective tax rates in and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for  and differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to utilization of tax loss carry forwards and the recognition of certain deferred tax assets previously subject to valuation allowance 
the company expects that its effective tax rate will be higher in future years as the amount of unrecognized deferred tax assets is reduced 
page of liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations to date primarily through cash flows from operations  the private sale of equity securities  and the initial public offering of common stock completed in september for the year ended december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by million to approximately million 
also during this period  working capital decreased by million to approximately million 
the company s operating activities used cash of approximately million in and generated cash of million in and  in cash used in operating activities for was comprised primarily of net loss  a decrease in customer deposits  an increase in inventory  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets  offset partially by an increase in non cash items including acquired in process research and write off of intangibles and goodwill  and higher depreciation and amortization expense 
the company expects that its accounts receivable and inventory will continue to grow and such increases are likely to increase the company s requirements for working capital 
cash provided by operating activities for was comprised primarily of net income  an increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and customer deposits offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
on february  the company used cash to acquire spectral  incorp orated  a washington based company  that develops and markets pc based digi tal audio workstations 
the cost of the acquisition was approximately  which included the purchase of spectral s stock for  and debt reduction of  as of december   the company s sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling approximately mil lion  and an unsecured bank line of credit of up to  as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under such line of credit 
the company believes that its existing sources of liquidity  together with anticipated funds provided from operations  will be sufficient to finance its operations for at least the next months 
this paragraph contains forward looking statements reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual future performance will meet the company s current expectations 
inves tors are strongly encouraged to review the section entitled factors affecting future operating results commencing on page for a discus sion of factors that could affect future performance 
page of factors affecting future operating results the company has derived virtually all of its revenues from sales of its digitally controlled audio mixing console system  which system is based upon its proprietary software and hardware platform 
the company believes that sales of this system  along with enhancements thereof  will continue to constitute virtually all of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future  with only limited sales of digital audio workstations by spectral 
accordingly  any factor adversely affecting the company s base system  whether technical  competitive or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
a limited number of the company s system sales typically account for a substantial percentage of the company s quarterly revenue because of the relatively high average sales price of such systems 
moreover  the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations of future revenue 
there fore  if revenue is below expectations  the company s operating results are likely to be adversely affected 
in addition  the timing of revenue is influenced by a number of other factors  including the timing of individual orders and shipments  industry trade shows  seasonal customer buying patterns  changes in product development and sales and marketing expenditures  custom financing arrangements  production limitations and international sales activ ity 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated reve nue levels and a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  variations in the timing of recognition of revenue could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter and may result in unanticipated quarterly earnings shortfalls or losses 
the markets for the company s system are characterized by changing tech nologies and new product introductions 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its continued ability to enhance its base system with features including new software and hardware add ons and to develop or ac quire and introduce new products and features which meet new market demands and changing customer requirements on a timely basis 
the company is currently designing and developing new products  primarily in the areas of recording  editing and mixing functions of sound production as well as digital audio processing and networking systems 
the substantial investment in these new developments will result in higher research and development expenses to be incurred over the next twelve months and therefore reduce operating profits 
in addition  there can be no assurance that products or technologies dev eloped by others will not render the company s products or technologies non competitive or obsolete 
see business 
to date  the company s primary market success has been in the music segment of the professional audio market 
in order for the company to grow  the company believes that it must continue to gain market share in the music market segment  as well as in its other targeted market segments 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete favorably in any other market seg ments 
the company s inability to compete favorably could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the markets for the company s products are intensely competitive and characterized by significant price competition 
the company believes that its ability to compete depends on elements both within and outside its control  including the success and timing of new product development including development on a timely basis of a hybrid digital product  of which there can be no assurance and introduction by the company and its competitors  product performance and price  distribu tion  availability of lease or other financing alternatives  resale of used systems and customer support 
see business competition 
currently  the company uses many sole or limited source suppliers  certain of which are critical to the integrated circuits included in the company s base system 
major delays or terminations in supplies of such components could have a significant adverse effect on the company s timely shipment of its products  which in turn would adversely affect the company s business and results of oper ations 
the company also relies on single vendors to manufacture major subassem blies for its products 
any extended interruption in the future supply or in crease in the cost of subassemblies manufactured by its primary or other third party vendors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business page of and results of operations 
see business manufacturing and suppliers 
in addition  as different electrical  radiation or other standards applicable to the company s products are adopted in countries  including the united states  or groups of countries in which the company sells its products  the failure of the company to modify its products  if necessary  to comply with such standards would likely have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see business sales and distribution 
the company generally relies on a combination of trade secret  copyright law and trademark law  contracts and technical measures to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products and technologies 
however  the company believes that such measures provide only limited protection of its proprietary information  and there is no assurance that such measures will be adequate to prevent misappropriation 
in addition  significant and protracted litigation may be necessary to protect the company s intellectual property rights  to determine the scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement 
there can be no assurance that third party claims alleging infringement will not be asserted against the company in the future 
any such claims could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see business proprietary rights 
the company s success depends  in part  on its ability to retain key management and technical employees and its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
in addition  the company s ability to manage any growth will require it to continue to improve and expand its management  operational and financial systems and controls 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  its business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
the company acquired spectral in february sale of spectral products for were significantly below plan and below sales levels 
the year over year decrease in sales was primarily attributed to increased competition  product development delays and revamping of their distributor channels of the current digital audio workstation product line 
spectral s pre tax operating losses for also increased significantly due primarily to lower sales volumes and increased engineering staffing costs 
in  sales are expected to remain near levels 
in  spectral engineering  marketing and sales activities were integrated into the respective euphonix organizations 
in  the company plans to further integrate spectral activities by the transfer of their manufacturing to euphonix headquarters in palo alto  calif ornia 
as a result of these and other factors  the company has experienced signifi cant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipates that these fluctuations will continue in future periods 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining or improving its profitability or avoiding losses in any future period 
further  it is likely that in some future period the company s net revenues or operating results will be below the expectations of public market securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected
