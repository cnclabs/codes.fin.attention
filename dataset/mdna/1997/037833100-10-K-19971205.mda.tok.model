item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section and other parts of this form k contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the subsection entitled factors that may affect operating results and financial condition below 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
all information is based on the company s fiscal calendar 
overview during  the company continued to experience declines in net sales  units shipped and share of the personal computer market compared to prior years 
the decline in demand and the resulting losses  coupled with intense price competition throughout the industry  led to the company s decision to continue to restructure its business during aimed at reducing its core structure  improving its competitiveness and restoring sustainable profitability 
the company s restructuring efforts have included significant headcount reductions  simplifications and modifications of the company s product lines  increases in the proportion of products manufactured under outsourcing arrangements and the implementation of an on line store in the us in addition  the company plans to increase the proportion of products manufactured on a made to order basis the company believes that restructuring actions effected through the fourth quarter of  as well as those currently planned to be effected during  will decrease operating expenses in compared with there is no assurance that such decreases in operating expenses will be achieved or that  if achieved  such reductions will be sufficient to offset the decline in the company s net sales 
in february  the company acquired next 
next developed  marketed and supported software that enables customers to implement business applications on the internet world wide web  intranets and enterprise wide client server networks 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the operating results pertaining to next subsequent to the date of acquisition have been included in the company s consolidated operating results 
the total purchase price  including the fair value of the net liabilities assumed  was million of which million was allocated to purchased in process research and development and million was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 
the purchased in process research and development was charged to operations upon acquisition  and the goodwill and other tangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over two years 
the company had previously entered into agreements to license its mac os to other personal computer vendors the clone vendors as part of an effort to increase the installed base for the macintosh platform 
the company recently determined that the benefits of licensing the mac os to the clone vendors under these agreements were more than offset by the impact and costs of the licensing program 
as a result  the company agreed to acquire certain assets  including the license to distribute the mac os  of pcc  a clone vendor  and has no plans to renew its other mac os licensing agreements 
the company s future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon the company s ability to successfully develop  manufacture  and market technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand patterns  and are also dependent upon its ability to effect a change in marketplace perception of the company s prospects  including the viability of the macintosh platform 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results and a favorable financial condition 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s future operating results and financial condition include  among other things  continued competitive pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the company to such competitive pressures  including pricing actions by the company  the availability of key components on terms acceptable to the company  the company s ability to supply products in certain categories  the company s ability to supply products free of latent defects or other faults  the company s ability to make timely delivery to the marketplace of technological innovations  including its ability to continue to make timely delivery of planned enhancements to the current mac os and to make timely delivery of a new and substantially backward compatible operating system  the company s ability to successfully integrate next technologies  processes and employees with those at apple  the company s ability to successfully implement its strategic direction and restructuring actions  including reducing its expenditures  the company s ability to attract  motivate and retain employees  including a new chief executive officer  the effects of significant adverse publicity  the availability of third party software for particular applications  and the impact on the company s sales  market share and gross margins as a result of the company winding down its mac os licensing program

the average aggregate revenue per macintosh unit decreased slightly in the fourth quarter of compared with the same period of  as a result of continued pricing actions  including increased rebates  across most product lines  partially offset by an increase in the average aggregate revenue per powerbook unit 
the average aggregate revenue per peripheral product also decreased slightly for the foregoing reasons 
the average aggregate revenue per macintosh computer unit and per peripheral unit will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors  including industrywide pricing pressures  increased competition  and the need to stimulate demand for the company s products 
international net sales represented of total net sales in the fourth quarter of compared with of net sales in the same period of international net sales declined in the fourth quarter of compared with the same period of net sales decreased in the european markets and decreased significantly in japan during the fourth quarter of compared with the same period of  as a result of decreases in macintosh and peripheral unit sales in europe and japan and in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit in the european markets and the average aggregate revenue per macintosh unit in japan 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in the average aggregate revenue per macintosh unit in europe and the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit in japan

domestic net sales declined in the fourth quarter of over the comparable period of  due to decreases in unit sales of macintosh computers and peripheral products and in the average aggregate revenue per macintosh unit  partially offset by an increase in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit 
during the fourth quarter of compared with the comparable period of  the company s estimated share of the worldwide and us personal computer markets declined to from  and to from  respectively  based upon current market information provided by industry sources 
q compared with q net sales decreased in the fourth quarter of compared with the third quarter of total macintosh computer unit sales decreased in the fourth quarter of compared with the prior quarter which the company believes was due principally to continued customer concerns regarding the company s strategic direction  financial condition and future prospects  and the viability of the macintosh platform  and to competitive pressures in the marketplace  as well as continued easing of pent up demand for new powerbook products which were introduced in the second quarter 
in addition  unit sales in japan decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of compared with the third quarter of  primarily as a result of a weaker personal computer market 
unit sales of peripheral products decreased slightly in the fourth quarter of compared with the third quarter of the average aggregate revenue per macintosh computer unit remained constant as higher average aggregate revenue per value entry level power macintosh unit was offset by a lower average aggregate revenue per powerbook unit and aggressive pricing on discontinued products 
the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit decreased in the fourth quarter of compared with the third quarter of furthermore  the average aggregate revenue per macintosh computer and peripheral unit was unfavorably affected by pricing actions  including increased rebates  across most product lines 
international net sales represented of total net sales in the fourth quarter of  compared with in the third quarter of international net sales decreased in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter of  primarily as a result of a significant decrease in net sales of macintosh computers and peripheral products in japan and a decrease in the average aggregate revenue per macintosh unit  slightly offset by an increase in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit 
further discussion relating to factors contributing to the decline in net sales in the japanese market may be found in this part ii  item of form k under the subheading global market risks included under the heading factors that may affect future results and financial condition  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
domestic net sales increased in the fourth quarter of compared with the prior quarter  due to increases in macintosh and peripheral unit sales and the average aggregate revenue per macintosh computer unit  which increases were slightly offset by a decrease in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit 
during the fourth quarter of compared with the third quarter of  the company s estimated share of the worldwide and us personal computer markets decreased to from  and to from  respectively  based upon current market information provided by industry sources 
year ended september  compared with year ended september  net sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of  decreasing  million  or   million  or  and million  or  during the twelve  nine  and three months ended september   respectively  compared with the same periods in  due to a decrease in net sales of macintosh computers and of peripheral products 
total macintosh computer unit sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of  decreasing   and during the twelve  nine  and three months ended september   respectively  compared with the same periods in this decline in unit sales was a result of a decline or lack of growth in worldwide demand for all product families  which the company believes was due principally to customer concerns regarding the company s strategic direction  financial condition  and future prospects  and due to delays in the shipment of certain powerbook products as a result of quality problems 
in addition  unit sales of peripheral products trended downward beginning in the second quarter of  decreasing   and during the twelve  nine and three months ended september   respectively  compared with the same periods in  for the reasons noted above 
the average aggregate revenue per macintosh unit increased slightly during the twelve and three months ended september   and decreased slightly during the nine months ended september   compared with the same periods in  primarily due to a continued shift in product mix toward the company s newer products and products with multimedia configurations  offset to varying degrees by pricing actions across all product lines 
the average aggregate revenue per peripheral product was flat during the twelve  nine  and three months ended september  compared with the same periods in international net sales represented of net sales in compared with of net sales in international net sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of  decreasing  and during the twelve  nine  and three months ended september   respectively  compared with the same periods in net sales in european markets trended downward beginning in the second quarter of  decreasing during the twelve  nine  and three months ended september  compared with the same periods in  as a result of a decrease in macintosh and peripheral unit sales  partially offset by an increase in the average aggregate revenue per macintosh and per peripheral unit  primarily during the first part of the year 
net sales in japan trended downward beginning in the second quarter of  decreasing during the twelve  nine  and three months ended september  compared with the same periods in an increase in macintosh unit sales during these periods was more than offset by a decrease in the average aggregate revenue per macintosh and per peripheral unit and a decrease in peripheral unit sales 
domestic net sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of  decreasing by   and for the twelve  nine  and three months ended september   respectively  compared with the corresponding periods in  resulting from a decline or lack of growth in demand for all product families 
in the fourth quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of  the company s share of the worldwide and us personal computer markets declined to from  and to from  respectively  based on current information provided by industry sources 
backlog in general  the company s resellers purchase products on an as needed basis 
resellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates depending on changing market conditions 
unfilled orders backlog can be  and often are  canceled at will 
the company attempts to fill orders on the requested delivery schedules 
however  products may be in relatively short supply from time to time until production volumes have reached a level sufficient to meet demand or if other production or fulfillment constraints exist 
the company s backlog of unfilled orders decreased to approximately million at november  from approximately million at november  and consisted primarily of the company s flagship line of higher end power macintosh products 
the company s backlog at november  consisted primarily of the company s powerbook products  as well as the company s flagship line of higher end power macintosh products 
the company expects that substantially all of its orders in backlog at november  will be either shipped or canceled during fiscal in the company s experience  the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects 
in particular  backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following introduction of new products because of overordering by dealers anticipating shortages 
backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply 
because of the foregoing  as well as other factors affecting the company s backlog  backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 
further information regarding the company s backlog may be found in part ii  item of this form k under the subheading product introductions and transitions included under the heading factors that may affect future results and financial condition  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
gross margin gross margin represents the difference between the company s net sales and its cost of goods sold 
the amount of revenue generated per unit sold is influenced by the price set by the company for its products 
the cost of goods sold is based primarily on the cost of components and  to a lesser extent  direct labor costs 
the type and cost of components included in particular configurations of the company s products such as memory and disk drives are often directly related to the need to market products in configurations competitive with other manufacturers 
competition in the personal computer industry is intense and  in the short term  frequent changes in pricing and product configuration are often necessary in order to remain competitive 
accordingly  gross margin as a percentage of net sales can be significantly influenced in the short term by actions undertaken by the company in response to industrywide competitive pressures 
gross margin increased from to of sales during compared to  primarily as a result of a million charge in the second quarter of that related principally to the write down of certain inventory  as well as to the cost of cancelling excess component orders necessitated by significantly lower than expected demand for many of the company s products  primarily its value line of power macintosh products formerly generally referred to as entry level and performa registered trademark products 
the company separately incurred approximately million in charges during to provide for the estimated costs of correcting certain quality problems in certain of its value line of power macintosh products  as well as powerbook and peripheral products  covering both goods held in inventory and shipped goods 
in addition  gross margins in the second quarter of  and to a lesser degree the first quarter of that year  were adversely affected by aggressive pricing actions in japan in response to extreme competitive actions by other companies  as well as price reductions in the united states and europe across all product lines in order to stimulate demand 
gross margin decreased from to of sales during the fourth quarter of compared to the same period of  and remained constant compared to the third quarter of this was primarily as a result of certain pricing actions effected by the company as noted above  as well as the company s inability to fulfill all purchase orders of certain high margin power macintosh product due to the unavailability of sufficient quantities of certain components  which were offset to varying degrees by sales of the company s new operating system  mac os  during the fourth quarter of the gross margin levels in the fourth quarter of compared with the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of  and in compared with  were also adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies 
this negative impact was offset by currency hedging 
the company s operating strategy and pricing take into account changes in exchange rates over time  however  the company s results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain the gross margin levels achieved in gross margins will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors  including continued industrywide global pricing pressures  increased competition  and compressed product life cycles 
in response to these downward pressures  the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products 
the company expects to experience additional pricing pressure through at least the first fiscal quarter of as a result of the company winding down its mac os licensing program  including the acquisition of its mac os license and other assets of power computing corporation pcc  as the company expects certain mac os licensees to sell aggressively their remaining inventory in early fiscal gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs  and to stimulate demand for certain of its products 
gross margin decreased to in compared with in this decrease is primarily the result of a million charge in the second quarter of for the write down of certain inventory  as well as the costs of cancelling excess component orders  necessitated by significantly lower than expected demand for many of the company s products  primarily its entry level products 
the company separately incurred approximately million in charges during the last nine months of to provide for the estimated costs of correcting certain quality problems in certain of the value line of power macintosh products as well as powerbook and peripheral products  covering both goods held in inventory and shipped goods 
the company also incurred greater warranty expenses per unit sold during compared with the decrease in gross margin was also due to the company s response to extreme competitive actions by other companies attempting to gain market share  including the company s pricing actions in the us  japan and europe across most product lines  which were partially offset by a decrease in the cost of certain product components 
research and development change change research and development percentage of net sales research and development expenditures decreased in dollar amounts in when compared with  primarily due to certain restructuring actions  including a reduction in headcount and the cancellation of certain research and development related contracts  taken during the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales resulted from a decrease in the level of net sales 
there was a slight decrease in research and development expenditures during compared with the slight increase as a percentage of net sales in over was the result of a decrease in net sales during the company believes that continued and focused investments in research and development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to continued  timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company s core business strategy 
the company believes that research and development expenditures will decrease in compared to as the company completes and more fully realizes the cost reduction benefits of its restructuring plan

selling  general and administrative change change selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenditures decreased in dollar amounts in when compared to  primarily due to certain restructuring actions  including a reduction in headcount  the closing of facilities  and the writedown of assets  taken during  and to lower variable expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenditures as a percentage of net sales resulted from a decrease in the level of net sales 
in  selling  general and administrative expenditures remained essentially flat when compared to the increase as a percentage of net sales in over was the result of a decrease in net sales during the company believes that selling  general and administrative expenditures will decrease in compared to as the company completes and more fully realizes the cost reduction benefits of its restructuring plan 
the company believes that selling  general and administrative expenditures will decrease only slightly in the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of as a result of continued cost reduction benefits from the restructuring plan  partially offset by planned advertising spending 
special charges in process research and development as a result of the next acquisition  the company took a substantial charge for in process research and development during further discussion relating to the company s acquisition of next  including the related in process research and development charge  may be found in part ii  item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the subheading next acquisition included under the heading special charges  which information is hereby incorporated by reference

interest and other income expense  net change change interest and other income expense  net nm interest and other income expense  net  decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to gains realized in on sales of available for sale and other securities 
interest and other income expense  net  also decreased compared to the prior year due to decreased foreign exchange gains  net of cost  in compared to  partially offset by higher average cash balances during over the last two years  the company s debt ratings have been downgraded to non investment grade 
the company s cost of funds may increase as a result of the downgrading in the second quarter of of its senior and subordinated long term debt to b and caa  respectively  by moody s investor services  and the downgrading in october of its senior and subordinated long term debt to b and ccc  respectively  by standard and poor s rating agency 
in  interest and other income expense  net  increased to million in income from million in expense in this million favorable change was primarily composed of a favorable variance of million related to net realized and unrealized foreign exchange hedging gains and lower foreign exchange hedging costs  primarily as a result of lower market and option volatility  higher us interest rates compared with rates abroad  and reduced foreign currency cash flows  an increase of million related to realized gains on the sale of most of the company s available for sale and other equity securities during  partially offset by a million unfavorable variance  as a result of higher average debt balances and lower average cash balances during  and an overall decline in average interest rate yields

provision benefit for income taxes as of september   the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences  tax losses  and tax credits of million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the company s balance sheet 
a substantial portion of this asset is realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities 
in  an increase in the valuation allowance of million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses which may not be realized 
realization of approximately million of the asset representing tax loss and credit carryforwards is dependent on the company s ability to generate approximately million of future us taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that forecasted us income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  will be sufficient to utilize the tax carryforwards prior to their expiration in and to fully recover this asset 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will meet its expectations of future us income 
as a result  the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near and long term if estimates of future taxable us income are reduced 
such an occurrence could materially adversely affect the company s financial results 
the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance 
additional information relating to income taxes  may be found in part ii  item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition restructuring of operations during  the company began to implement certain restructuring actions aimed at reducing its cost structure  improving its competitiveness  and restoring sustainable profitability 
during  the company announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring actions  including significant headcount reductions  to meet the foregoing objectives 
there are several risks inherent in the company s efforts to transition to a new cost structure 
these include the risk that the company will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough to restore sustainable profitability and the risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair the company s ability to innovate and remain competitive in the computer industry 
implementation of this restructuring involves several risks  including the risk that by simplifying and modifying its product line the company will increase its dependence on fewer products  potentially reduce overall sales  and increase its reliance on unproven products and technology 
another risk of the restructuring is that by increasing the proportion of the company s products to be manufactured under outsourcing arrangements  the company could lose control of the quality or quantity of the products manufactured and distributed  or lose the flexibility to make timely changes in production schedules in order to respond to changing market conditions 
as part of its restructuring  the company announced and opened its on line store  which makes available most of its products to end users in the us  in november there can be no assurance the on line store will result in greater sales 
the company also began manufacturing products on a build to order basis in november there can be no assurance this manufacturing process will result in decreased costs or increased gross margins 
the company is also reducing the number of wholesale and retail channel partners  particularly in the americas  which places a greater volume of sales through fewer partners 
there can be no assurance that this will not adversely impact the company 
in addition  the actions taken in connection with the restructuring could adversely affect employee morale  thereby damaging the company s ability to retain and motivate employees 
also  because the company contemplates relying to a greater extent on collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties  the company will have less direct control over certain of its research and development efforts  and its ability to create innovative new products may be reduced 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the technologies acquired from next will be successfully exploited  or that key next employees and processes will be retained and successfully integrated with those at apple 
also  the restructuring includes the winding down of the company s mac os licensing program 
there can be no assurance that the winding down of this program will result in greater sales  market share  and increased gross margins to the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that this action will not result in the availability of fewer application software titles for the mac os  which may result in a decrease to the company s sales  market share and gross margins 
finally  even if the restructuring is successfully implemented  there can be no assurance that it will effectively resolve the various issues currently facing the company 
although the company believes that the actions it is taking in connection with the restructuring  including its acquisition of next and the winding down of its mac os licensing program  should help restore marketplace confidence in the company  there can be no assurance that such actions will enable the company to achieve its objectives of reducing its cost structure  improving its competitiveness  and restoring sustainable profitability 
the company s future consolidated operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected should it encounter difficulty in effectively managing the restructuring and new cost structure 
additional information relating to the restructuring of operations may be found in part ii  item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the subheading restructuring of operations included under the heading special charges  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry  which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances  the company must continuously introduce new products and technologies and enhance existing products in order to remain competitive 
recent introductions include certain powerbook and power macintosh products  and the introduction of mac os in july the success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors  including market acceptance  the company s ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions  the availability of application software for new products  the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand  the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand  and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction 
accordingly  the company cannot determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations 
in addition  although the number of new product introductions may decrease as a result of the company s restructuring actions  the risks and uncertainties associated with new product introductions may increase as the company refocuses its product offerings on key growth segments and to the extent new product introductions are in markets that are new to the company 
the rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a new product is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of shipments for that product  which depends on many factors  some of which are not under the control of the company 
these factors may include initial large purchases by a small segment of the user population that tends to purchase new technology prior to its acceptance by the majority of users early adopters  purchases in satisfaction of pent up demand by users who anticipated new technology and  as a result  deferred purchases of other products  and overordering by dealers who anticipate shortages due to the aforementioned factors 
these factors may be offset by others  such as the deferral of purchases by many users until new technology is accepted as proven and for which commonly used software products are available  and the reduction of orders by dealers once they believe they can obtain sufficient supply of products previously in backlog 
backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to the aforementioned demand factors  often increasing coincident with introduction  and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply of the new products 
the company has in the past experienced difficulty in anticipating demand for new products  resulting in product shortages which have adversely affected the company s operating results 
the measurement of demand for newly introduced products is further complicated by the availability of different product configurations  which may include various types of built in peripherals and software 
configurations may also require certain localization such as language for various markets and  as a result  demand in different geographic areas may be a function of the availability of third party software in those localized versions 
for example  the availability of european language versions of software products manufactured by us producers may lag behind the availability of us versions by a quarter or more 
this may result in lower initial demand for the company s new products outside the us  even though localized versions of the company s products may be available 
the increasing integration of new or enhanced functions and complexity of operations of the company s products also increase the risk that latent defects or other faults could be discovered by customers or end users after volumes of products have been produced or shipped 
if such defects were significant  the company could incur material recall and replacement costs under product warranties 
the company has announced plans for two operating systems 
the company plans to continue to introduce major upgrades to the current mac os and later introduce a new operating system code named rhapsody which is expected to offer advanced functionality based on apple and next software technologies 
however  the next software technologies that the company plans to use in the development of rhapsody were not originally designed to be compatible with the mac os 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the development of rhapsody can be completed at reasonable cost or at all 
in addition  rhapsody may not be fully backward compatible with all existing applications  which could result in a loss of existing customers 
finally  it is uncertain whether rhapsody or the planned enhancements to the current mac os will gain developer support and market acceptance 
inability to successfully develop and make timely delivery of a substantially backward compatible rhapsody or of planned enhancements to the current mac os  or to gain developer support and market acceptance for those operating systems  may have an adverse impact on the company s consolidated operating results and financial condition 
competition the personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices  downward pressure on gross margins  frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles  continual improvement in product price performance characteristics  price sensitivity on the part of consumers  and a large number of competitors 
the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition have been  and in the future may continue to be  adversely affected by industrywide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins 
the industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality and hardware performance and features based on existing or emerging industry standards 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial  marketing  manufacturing  and technological resources  as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the company 
the company s future consolidated operating results and financial condition may be affected by overall demand for personal computers and general customer preferences for one platform over another or one set of product features over another 
the company is currently the primary maker of hardware that uses the mac os 
the mac os has a minority market share in the personal computer market  which is dominated by makers of computers that run the microsoft windows and windows nt operating systems 
the company believes that the mac os  with its perceived advantages over windows  and the general reluctance of the macintosh installed base to incur the costs of switching platforms  have been driving forces behind sales of the company s personal computer hardware for the past several years 
recent innovations in the windows platform  including those included in windows and windows nt  or those expected to be included in a new version of windows to be introduced in  have added features to the windows platform that make the differences between the mac os and microsoft s windows operating systems less significant 
the company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of the recent innovations in the windows platform 
the company s future operating results and financial condition will be substantially dependent on its ability to maintain continuing improvements of the macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived functional advantages over competing platforms 
the company had previously entered into agreements to license its mac os to other personal computer vendors the clone vendors as part of an effort to increase the installed base for the macintosh platform 
the company recently determined that the benefits of licensing the mac os to the clone vendors under these agreements were more than offset by the impact and costs of the licensing program 
as a result  the company agreed to acquire certain assets  including the license to distribute the mac os  of pcc  a clone vendor  and has no plans to renew its other mac os licensing agreements 
although the company believes that this winding down of its licensing program will help reduce the adverse impact of the licensing program on the company s sales  market share and gross margins  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
in addition  there can be no assurance that this winding down of the licensing program will not result in the availability of fewer application software titles for the mac os  which may result in a decrease to the company s sales  market share and gross margins 
as a supplemental means of addressing the competition from windows and other platforms  the company had previously devoted substantial resources toward developing personal computer products capable of running application software designed for the windows operating systems 
these products include an add on card containing a pentium or class microprocessor that enables users to run applications concurrently that require the mac os  windows or windows operating systems 
the company plans to transition the cross platform business to third parties during there can be no assurance that this transition will be successful 
the company  international business machines corporation and motorola  inc had agreed upon and announced the availability of specifications for a powerpc microprocessor based hardware platform the platform 
these specifications defined a unified personal computer architecture that would have given the clone vendors broad access to the power macintosh platform and would have utilized standard industry components 
the company had intended to license the mac os to manufacturers of the platform 
however  the company has decided it will no longer support the platform based upon its decision to wind down its mac os licensing program  and because of little industry support for the platform 
the decision not to further develop this platform may affect the company s ability to increase the installed base for the macintosh platform 
several competitors of the company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the company s key market segments  including education and publishing 
many of these companies have greater financial  marketing  manufacturing  and technological resources than the company 
in august  the company and microsoft entered into patent cross licensing and technology agreements 
under these agreements  the companies provided patent cross licenses to each other 
in addition  for a period of five years from august  microsoft will make future versions of its microsoft office and internet explorer products for the mac os  and the company will bundle the internet explorer product with mac os system software releases and make that product the default internet browser for such releases 
in addition  microsoft purchased  shares of apple series a non voting convertible preferred stock for million 
while the company believes that its relationship with microsoft will be beneficial to the company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the mac os  the microsoft relationship is for a limited term and does not cover many of the areas in which the company competes with microsoft  including the windows platform 
in addition  the microsoft relationship may have an adverse effect on  among other things  the company s relationship with other partners 
there can be no assurance that the benefits to the company of the microsoft relationship will not be offset by the disadvantages 
support from third party software developers decisions by customers to purchase the company s personal computers  as opposed to windows based systems  are often based on the availability of third party software for particular applications 
the company believes that the availability of third party application software for the company s hardware products depends in part on third party developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing  maintaining  and upgrading such software for the company s products versus software for the larger windows market 
this analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products  the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated  and the costs of developing such software products 
to the extent the company s recent financial losses and declining demand for the company s products  as well as the company s decision to wind down its mac os licensing program  have caused software developers to question the company s prospects in the personal computer market  developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the company s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market 
moreover  the company s current plan to introduce a new operating system code named rhapsody could cause software developers to stop developing software for the current mac os 
in addition  there can be no assurance that software developers will decide to develop software for the new operating system on a timely basis or at all 
microsoft is an important developer of application software for the company s products 
although the company has entered into a relationship with microsoft  which includes microsoft s agreement to develop and ship future versions of its microsoft office and internet explorer products and certain other microsoft tools for the mac os  such relationship is for a limited term and does not cover many areas in which the company competes with microsoft 
accordingly  microsoft s interest in producing application software for the mac os not covered by the relationship or upon expiration of the relationship may be influenced by microsoft s perception of its interests as the vendor of the windows operating system 
global market risks a large portion of the company s revenue is derived from its international operations 
as a result  the company s consolidated operations and financial results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities  including economic and labor conditions  political instability  tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries  and changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold 
countries in the asia pacific region  including japan  have recently experienced weaknesses in their currency  banking and equity markets 
these weaknesses could adversely affect consumer demand for the company s product  the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales  the availability and supply of product components to the company  and ultimately the company s consolidated results of operations 
when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  the us dollar value of non us dollar based sales decreases 
when the non us dollar weakens  the us dollar value of us dollar based sales increases 
correspondingly  the us dollar value of us dollar based costs increases when the us dollar weakens and decreases when the us dollar strengthens 
overall  the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect the company s consolidated sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
while the company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the interest rates of many of the world s leading industrialized countries  the company s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in us interest rates  the company has entered into interest rate swap  collar  and floor transactions 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the company s foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions  as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios  the company continually monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions  and its interest rate swap  option and floor positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures  respectively  from both an accounting and an economic perspective 
however  given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities  there can be no assurance that the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect the company s consolidated operating results and financial position 
the company does not engage in leveraged hedging 
the company s current financial condition may increase the costs of its hedging transactions  as well as affect the nature of the hedging transactions into which the company s counterparties are willing to enter 
additional information regarding the company s foreign exchange and interest rate risk management programs and the accounting thereon  may be found in part ii  item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory and supply the company makes a provision for inventories of products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand  accrues for any cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been canceled  and accrues for the estimated costs to correct any product quality problems 
although the company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry  no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional inventory and related charges 
in addition  such charges have had  and may again have  a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the company must order components for its products and build inventory well in advance of product shipments 
because the company s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes  there is a risk that the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
the company s consolidated operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns 
certain of the company s products are manufactured in whole or in part by third party manufacturers  either pursuant to design specifications of the company or otherwise 
as part of its restructuring actions  the company sold its fountain  colorado  manufacturing facility to sci and entered into a related manufacturing outsourcing agreement with sci  sold its singapore printed circuit board manufacturing assets to natsteel electronics pte  ltd  which is expected to supply main logic boards to the company under a manufacturing outsourcing agreement  entered into an agreement with ryder integrated logistics  inc to outsource the company s domestic operations transportation and logistics management  and has entered into other similar agreements to outsource the company s european operations transportation and logistics management 
as a result of the foregoing actions  the proportion of the company s products produced and distributed under outsourcing arrangements will continue to increase 
while outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations  they will also reduce the direct control the company has over production and distribution 
it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured  or the flexibility of the company to respond to changing market conditions 
furthermore  any efforts by the company to manage its inventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject the company to liquidated damages or cancellation of the arrangement 
moreover  although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement  the company remains at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service 
accordingly  in the event of product defects or warranty liability  the company may remain primarily liable 
any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability  whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise  could adversely affect the company s future consolidated operating results and financial condition 
although certain components essential to the company s business are generally available from multiple sources  other key components including microprocessors and application specific integrated circuits asics are currently obtained by the company from single sources 
if the supply of a key single sourced component were to be delayed or curtailed  the company s business and financial performance could be adversely affected  depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source  or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternate source 
the company believes that the availability from suppliers to the personal computer industry of microprocessors and asics presents the most significant potential for constraining the company s ability to manufacture products 
some advanced microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp up for production and thus have limited availability 
the company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for other semiconductor products with other industries that have experienced increased demand for such products  due to either increased consumer demand or increased use of semiconductors in their products such as the cellular phone and automotive industries 
finally  the company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and asics 
continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements 
such product supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could decrease the company s net sales and adversely affect the company s consolidated operating results and financial condition 
the company s ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of ibm and motorola  the sole suppliers of the powerpc risc microprocessor for the company s macintosh computers  to supply to company in adequate numbers microprocessors that produce superior price performance results compared with those supplied to the company s competitors by intel corporation  and other developers and producers of the microprocessors used by most personal computers using the windows operating systems 
the desire of ibm and motorola to continue producing these microprocessors may be influenced by microsoft s decision not to adapt its windows nt operating system software to run on the powerpc microprocessor 
ibm produces personal computers based on intel microprocessors as well as workstations based on the powerpc microprocessor  and is also the developer of os  a competing operating system to the company s mac os 
accordingly  ibm s interest in supplying the company with microprocessors for the company s products may be influenced by ibm s perception of its interests as a competing manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing operating system vendor 
in addition  motorola has recently announced its intention to stop producing mac clones 
as a result  motorola may be less inclined to continue to produce powerpc microprocessors 
the company s current financial condition and uncertainties related to recent events could affect the terms on which suppliers are willing to supply the company with their products 
there can be no assurance that the company s current suppliers will continue to supply the company on terms acceptable to the company or that the company will be able to obtain comparable products from alternate sources on such terms 
the company s future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if the company is unable to continue to obtain key components on terms substantially similar to those currently available to the company 
further discussion relating to availability and supply of components and product may be found in part i  item of this form k under the heading raw materials  and in part ii  item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the subheading concentrations in the available sources of supply and material product included under the heading concentrations of risk and under the subheading purchase commitments included under the heading commitments and contingencies  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
marketing and distribution a number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of the company s products 
currently  the company distributes its products through wholesalers  resellers  mass merchants  cataloguers and direct to education institutions collectively referred to as resellers 
in addition  in november the company began selling many of its products directly to end users in the us through the company s on line store 
many of the company s significant resellers operate on narrow product margins 
most such resellers also distribute products from competing manufacturers 
the company s business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened or if resellers within consumer channels were to decide not to continue to distribute the company s products 
uncertainty over demand for the company s products may continue to cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products 
in addition  the company has in the past and may in the future experience delays in ordering by resellers in light of uncertain demand for the company s products 
under the company s arrangements with its resellers  resellers have the option to reduce or eliminate unfilled orders previously placed  in most instances without financial penalty 
resellers also have the option to return products to the company without penalty within certain limits  beyond which they may be assessed fees 
the company has recently revised its channel program  including decreasing the number of resellers and reducing returns  price protection and certain rebate programs  in an effort to reduce channel inventory  increase inventory turns  increase product support within the channel and improve gross margins 
in addition  in november the company opened its on line store in the us which makes many of the company s products available directly to the end user 
although the company believes the foregoing changes will improve its consolidated operating results and financial condition  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
further discussion relating to marketing and distribution may be found in part i  item of this form k under the heading markets and distribution  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
change in senior management on july   the company announced that dr 
gilbert f 
amelio had resigned his positions as chairman of the board and chief executive officer and that the company was initiating a search for a new chief executive officer 
while the company intends to name a new chief executive officer as soon as practicable  there can be no assurance that the change in senior management and related uncertainties will not adversely affect the company s consolidated operating results and financial condition during the period until a new chief executive officer is hired and afterward 
in addition  certain members of the company s senior management have been with the company for less than six months 
there can be no assurance that new members of the management team can be successfully assimilated  that the company will be able to satisfactorily allocate responsibilities or that such new members of its management will succeed in their roles in a timely and efficient manner 
the company s failure to recruit  retain and assimilate new executives  or the failure of any such executive to perform effectively  or the loss of any such executive  could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes to board of directors the company announced on august  significant changes to its board of directors  replacing all but two former directors 
the continuing directors are gareth cc chang  corporate senior vice president  marketing  hughes electronics and president  hughes international  and edgar s 
woolard  jr  retired chairman of ei dupont de nemours company 
the new directors are william v 
campbell  president and ceo of intuit corp  lawrence j 
ellison  chairman and chief executive officer of oracle corp  steven p 
jobs  chairman and chief executive officer of pixar animation studios  and jerome b 
york  vice chairman of tracinda corporation and former chief financial officer of ibm and chrysler corporation 
dependence on key employees during the past several years  the company has experienced significant voluntary employee turnover as a result of employees concerns over the company s prospects  as well as the abundance of career opportunities available elsewhere 
the company is dependent on its key employees in order to achieve its business plan 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to attract  motivate and retain key employees 
failure to do so may have a significant effect on the company s consolidated operating results and financial condition 
other factors the company is in the process of identifying operating and application software challenges related to the year while the company expects to resolve year compliance issues substantially through normal replacement and upgrades of software  there can be no assurance that there will not be interruption of operations or other limitations of system functionality or that the company will not incur substantial costs to avoid such limitations 
any failure to effectively monitor  implement or improve the company s operational  financial  management and technical support systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and consolidated results of operations 
the majority of the company s research and development activities  its corporate headquarters  and other critical business operations  including certain major vendors  are located near major seismic faults 
the company s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 
production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental and other regulations which include  in some instances  the requirement that the company provide consumers with the ability to return to the company product at the end of its useful life  and leave responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company 
it is unclear what effect such regulations will have on the company s future consolidated operating results and financial condition 
the company recently decided to replace its existing transaction systems in the us which include order management  product procurement  distribution  and finance with a single integrated system as part of its ongoing effort to increase operational efficiency 
substantially all of the transaction systems in the european operations were replaced with the same integrated system in the company s future consolidated operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if the company is unable to implement and effectively manage the transition to this new integrated system 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s consolidated operating results and financial condition  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
in addition  the company s participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
liquidity and capital resources the company s consolidated financial position with respect to cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  net of notes payable to banks  decreased to  million as of september   from  million as of september  the company s consolidated financial position with respect to cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments decreased to  million as of september   from  million as of september  the company s cash and cash equivalent balances as of september  and september  include million and million  respectively  pledged as collateral to support letters of credit primarily associated with the company s purchase commitments under the terms of the sale of the company s fountain  colorado  manufacturing facility to sci 
cash generated by operations during totaled million 
cash generated by operations was primarily the result of decreases in accounts receivable and inventories  partially offset by the company s net loss  adjusted for non cash expenditures such as in process research and development  as well as decreases in accounts payable 
cash used to acquire next totaled million in the company expects no additional cash expenditures related to the next acquisition 
net cash used for the purchase of property  plant  and equipment totaled million in  and consisted primarily of increases in manufacturing machinery and equipment 
the company expects that the level of capital expenditures in will be comparable to cash generated by financing activities in included the sale of million of apple series a non voting convertible preferred stock to microsoft corporation 
cash used by financing activities in included million to retire notes payable to banks 
over the last two years  the company s debt ratings have been downgraded to non investment grade 
in october  the company s senior and subordinated long term debt were downgraded to b and ccc  respectively  by standard and poor s rating agency 
in the second quarter of  the company s debt ratings were downgraded to b and caa  respectively  by moody s investor services 
both standard and poor s rating agency and moody s investor services have the company on negative outlook 
these actions may increase the company s cost of funds in future periods 
in addition  the company may be required to pledge additional collateral with respect to certain of its borrowings and letters of credit and to agree to more stringent covenants than in the past 
the company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  and continued short term borrowings from banks  will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next twelve months 
expected cash requirements over the next twelve months include an estimated million to effect actions under the restructuring plan  most of which will be effected during the first half of fiscal no assurance can be given that the million in short term borrowings from banks can be continued  or that any additional required financing could be obtained should the restructuring plan take longer to implement than anticipated or be unsuccessful 
if the company is unable to obtain such financing  its liquidity  results of operations  and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
the internal revenue service irs has proposed federal income tax deficiencies for the years through  and the company has made certain prepayments thereon 
the company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing petitions with the us tax court  and most of the issues in dispute have now been resolved 
on june   the irs proposed income tax adjustments for the years through although a substantial number of the issues for these years have been resolved  certain issues still remain in dispute and are being contested by the company 
management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations
