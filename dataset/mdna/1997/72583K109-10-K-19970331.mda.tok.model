item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in june to develop and commercialize feds 
since its inception  the company has been a development stage company devoting a majority of its resources to conducting research and development  recruiting personnel  establishing a pilot manufacturing facility  forming the fed alliance and raising capital 
to date  most of the company s revenues have been cooperation and license revenues under agreements with members of the fed alliance and revenues from funding under grants from the french government and the european union 
in the future  the company expects to generate its revenue primarily from two sources i sale of products  from which the company has only recorded limited revenues to date  and ii cooperation and license revenues  including royalties  under the fed alliance agreements 
the company does not anticipate receiving any significant revenues from the sale of its products until the commencement of volume production and anticipates that it will not maintain the level of cooperation and license revenues from members of the fed alliance it has historically achieved until one or more of the existing members of the fed alliance commences volume production  or until the company succeeds in expanding the fed alliance 
in view of the development stage of the company and the current transition from revenues solely from the fed alliance to the addition of product sales revenues  the company believes that historical financial results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the company s expectations regarding its sources of future revenue are forward looking statements 
the amount  time and source of revenue generation will be affected by numerous matters including the availability of funds to finance its activities until volume shipments of products begin  the continued development of the company s products  including the cost effective reproduction of the favorable characteristics demonstrated by the company s current prototypes in the context of commercial production  the successful transition of the company s prototype manufacturing processes to commercial manufacturing processes to achieve commercially viable yields  the successful development of a volume supply of fed products under contract manufacturing  the successful commercialization of feds by other members of the fed alliance  and the successful development of sufficient market demand for the company s products 
the company s products and its manufacturing processes are still in the early stages of development and testing 
to date  the company has only shipped limited quantities of products incorporating fed technology 
the company s only commercially available displays are a inch cm monochrome display  offered for sale as part of an evaluation kit 
to date  among the members of the fed alliance  only futaba has announced the availability of commercial products in limited quantities 
pursuant to a license agreement with the cea  the company is obligated to make royalty payments on its product sales and to pass through a portion of certain up front license fees earned after and royalties on sales of products by the company and such sublicensees the leti license agreement 
an amount of million  reflected under the caption cost of revenues  license fees and royalties was accrued in with respect to such royalties and pass through expenses payable to cea 
an amount of  was recognized in  including  related to the termination of a litigation with an individual in which cea and pixtech were both involved 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note litigation 
all of the company s expenses to date  except royalties and pass through expenses payable to cea and tax expenses directly associated with revenues from fed alliance members  have been recorded as operating expenses  since the company has not shipped products in quantities sufficient to determine a meaningful cost of products sold category 
the company has incurred cumulative losses of million from inception to december  the company has incurred operating losses every quarter since inception  except during the three month period ending december   and expects to incur additional operating losses 
the magnitude and duration of the company s losses will depend on a number of factors within and outside of the company s control  including the company s ability to expand the fed alliance and the rate at which it can successfully manufacture and commercialize its feds  if at all  and the related costs of such efforts 
successful commercialization of such displays will in turn depend on a number of factors  including the successful development of sufficient market demand for the company s products 
results of operations cooperation and license revenues 
the company recognized cooperation and license revenues under the fed alliance agreements of million in and million in these revenues represent the achievement by the company of contractual milestones with fed alliance members 
however  the company has now recorded most of the expected revenues associated with the achievement of contractual milestones with existing fed alliance members and future fed alliance milestone revenues are mostly subject to expansion of the fed alliance 
the company recognizes milestone related revenue under fed alliance agreements when it is earned as a result of meeting the applicable milestone 
in  the company recognized million  representing the value of in kind payments with respect to technology transfer made by the company to texas instruments under the cooperation and license agreement with texas instruments executed on june  and terminated on july  to the extent the members of the fed alliance successfully incorporate the cross licensed technology in products  the company will recognize royalty revenues as such members sell the products 
the company also performs services in the field of technology development for fed alliance members  the related revenues are recognized when the services are rendered and the revenues become irrevocable 
product sales 
the company recognized product sales of  in and  in product sales in were related to the shipment of several types of cathodes to members of the fed alliance  with a goal of supporting fed alliance members own development programs  and also related to limited quantities of displays shipped in december product sales in represented the shipment of fed displays in limited quantities for evaluation by oem customers  demonstration units and fed cathodes to members of the fed alliance 
although the company expects to increase product shipments in  the company does not expect to achieve volume production in  since its asian based production source will not be able to manufacture fed displays before other revenues 
other revenues is comprised of funding under french or european union development contracts and other miscellaneous revenues 
other revenues were  in and  in  reflecting additional public funding as a result of a development contract entered into in and in november  the company entered into an agreement with the european union  as part of a european strategic programme for research and development in information technologies program 
this contract was started in december for a two year period 
total funding under this contract approximates  over the period of the contract 
the company recognized  in and  in no revenue was recorded with respect to this funding in in december  the company was awarded a grant from the french ministry of industry  telecommunications and foreign trade to support manufacturing of feds 
this grant covers technology development by the company from october to october total potential funding under this contract is approximately million 
the company records deferred revenues with respect to this grant on a pro rata basis over the period  and recognizes portions of this revenue when certain contractual conditions are met 
at december  and  deferred revenues in the amount of million and million  respectively  were included in non current liabilities 
the company did not recognize any revenue under this grant in  revenues of  were recorded in research and development expenses acquisition of intellectual property rights 
the company expensed million in for the acquisition of intellectual property rights from certain members of the fed alliance 
no such expenses were recorded in other research and development expenses 
other research and development expenses include obligations to the cea under the leti research agreement  contract consulting fees  salaries and associated operating expenses for in house research and development activities and the cost of staffing and operating the company s pilot manufacturing facility 
other research and development expenses increased from million in to million in these included expenses recorded under the leti research agreement of million in  and  in part of the increase recorded in in the company s research and development expenses is related to the launching of a new research effort in santa clara  california  involving technicians and engineers with a view to developing large size feds 
the increase also reflects the continued development of the company s fed technology and manufacturing processes and the expansion of the company s research and development and pilot manufacturing operations to employees at december  sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease reflects the reallocation of a limited number of engineers from sales marketing to research development 
the company believes sales and marketing expenses will increase in the future  as contact with potential customers and shipments of fed displays will develop 
such expectation regarding increased product shipments and customer contracts is a forward looking statement  the fulfillment of which is dependent on numerous factors 
see item business strategy 
in addition  in order to achieve its objectives  the company will need to expand its business rapidly and add sales  marketing  manufacturing  administrative and management personnel  as well as establish and manage its international operations 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in these increased expenses reflect an overall increase in administrative and support activities within the company  including personnel additions  legal fees in connection with fed alliance agreements and other professional fees resulting from becoming a public company 
interest income expense  net 
interest income is comprised of interest on cash and short term investments 
interest expense is comprised of interest payable on long term obligations 
net interest expense was  in  while the company recorded a net income of  in as the effect of the decrease in long term liabilities outweighed the effect of declining cash balances 
currency fluctuations 
although a significant portion of the company s revenues are denominated in us dollars  a substantial portion of the company s operating expenses are denominated in french francs 
gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of assets and liabilities denominated in french francs may contribute to fluctuations in the company s results of operations  which are reported in us dollars 
the company recorded net foreign exchange gains of  in and  in the company cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future operating results 
to date  the company has not undertaken hedging transactions to cover its currency exposure  but it may do so in the future 
income tax 
the company has recognized french income tax benefits of million since inception  including million in and million in these income tax benefits represent tax credits for research and development activities conducted in france and the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  net of valuation allowance 
the increase in tax benefit from to is due to the expansion of the company s research and development activities 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million was provided against a net deferred tax asset of million 
the tax credits for research and development activities will be paid in cash to the company if the company is not able to credit them against future income tax liabilities within three fiscal years 
in januray  the company collected  representing income tax benefit recorded in the company did not recognize any income tax benefit in the company does not expect to record significant additional tax credits for research and development activities  if any  in the foreseeable future  as the benefit is based on increases in eligible research and development expenses in a given year over the two previous fiscal years 
as of december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards in france of approximately million of which an aggregate million will expire in and if they are not utilized 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for each quarter in and in the opinion of the company s management  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results set forth herein 
the company s quarterly results are subject to fluctuations and thus  the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative for any future period

in the past  these fluctuations have been caused by a variety of factors  including the success of the company in entering new fed alliance agreements  achieving revenue producing milestones under the fed alliance agreements  and rate of growth of the company s research and development activities 
liquidity and capital resources the company has used million in cash to fund its operations from inception through december   and million in capital expenditures 
through december   the company has funded its operations and capital expenditures  including expenditures made in connection with the prosecution and maintenance of patents  primarily from sales of million of equity securities and million of proceeds from borrowings and sale leaseback transactions 
in addition  the company has been able to acquire a license and equipment in return for the issuance of long term debt and capital lease obligations in the aggregate amount of million  thereby partially reducing its need to expend cash 
capital expenditures were million in and million in these capital expenditures were primarily for leasehold improvements  facility expansion  and equipment installed in its pilot manufacturing facility 
as of december   the company had commitments for capital expenditures of approximately  the company has existing contracts with two different french ministries providing for the payment of grants to the company totaling approximately million  of which the company has collected an aggregate amount of million through december  and for which the company has recognized revenues in the aggregate amount of  included in other revenues 
million of these grants are payable in three installments subject to achievement by the company of hiring and capital expenditure milestones by december  the company collected the first installment  representing  in  which is included under the caption deferred revenues long term  million of these grants are payable in four installments see other revenues 
the company collected the first installment  representing  in january and recognized it as a revenue 
this installment is irrevocably granted to the company 
in january  the company collected the second installment  representing  which has not been recorded in the profit and loss account 
when collected  the balance of this grant may have to be repaid if the company does not conduct a specified technical program or does not comply with other terms of the grant  including certain restrictions on transfer of the company s technology 
the company believes that cash available at december  together with the estimated proceeds of its sales of shares in february see notes to consolidated financial statements note subsequent events  anticipated funds from the fed alliance agreements and from the grants described above will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements  including repayment of the current portion of its long term obligations in the amount of million at december   for at least months 
the company will require substantial funds to conduct research  development and testing  to develop and expand commercial scale manufacturing systems and to market any resulting products 
changes in technology or a growth of sales beyond currently anticipated levels will also require further investment 
the company s capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate at which the company can develop its products  the market acceptance of such products  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch such products and attain a competitive position in the marketplace and the response of competitors to the company s products 
there can be no assurance that funds for these purposes  whether from equity or debt financing  or other sources  will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
outlook issues and risks the company is focused on the continued development of the fed technology  the strengthening and expansion of the fed alliance  the improvement of manufacturing yields  and the reliability testing of new products which the company expects will lead to the shipment of commercial products in the near future 
in evaluating this outlook  the following risks and issues  among others  which are common with development stage companies  should be considered 
revenues from fed alliance members 
future technology transfer payments to the company under the fed alliance agreements are based on the achievement by specified dates of certain technical  manufacturing and marketing milestones 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when such milestones will be attained 
to date  the company has recorded most of the expected revenues associated with the achievement of contractual milestones with existing fed alliance members and certain of the future fed alliance milestone revenues are subject to expansion of the alliance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in entering into any new fed alliance agreements with other companies that have proprietary display related technology  and failure to expand the fed alliance could adversely affect the company 
in addition  a decision by any member of the fed alliance to limit or terminate its development effort in the area of field emission displays could have a material adverse effect on the company  and the company could lose a material portion of its revenue base while still bearing significant costs 
products and manufacturing processes under development  need to increase yields  costs of products 
the company s products and its manufacturing are in the development stage 
the company has to date encountered a number of delays in the development of its products and manufacturing processes 
no assurance can be given that further delays will not occur 
the company does not plan to increase production from its pilot facility beyond low volume levels 
the company believes that contract manufacturing with its asian partner will make it possible to manufacture volume quantities of feds at commercially acceptable cost 
however  moving from pilot production to volume production involves a number of steps and challenges 
this transition will require the refinement of manufacturing technologies and processes  involving the commitment of significant engineering and management resources 
no assurance can be given that the result of such development efforts will be successful 
in particular  in order to demonstrate the low cost potential of its fed technology  the company will need to improve its manufacturing yields 
failure to improve manufacturing yields would have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to implement processes for the manufacture of volume quantities of fed products at commercially viable cost levels or on a timely basis 
if such processes are not successfully implemented  the company would be materially adversely affected 
risks associated with contract manufacturing of feds 
the company believes that its ability to commercialize medium to large volumes of feds is highly dependent on its ability to have feds manufactured by a major manufacturer in the amlcd industry 
to date  the company has executed a memorandum of understanding with unipac  an amlcd manufacturer based in taiwan  and has initiated field work with this manufacturer  but the company has not yet signed a definitive display foundry agreement 
if such contract manufacturing agreement is not entered into on favorable terms  or on a timely basis  the company will not be able to ship medium to large volumes of fed products  or to obtain a commercially acceptable cost on its fed displays 
if the company is unable to have its feds manufactured in a cost effective manner  the company would be materially adversely affected 
although the company believes many fed manufacturing process steps can be carried out with equipment similar to that used by amlcd manufacturers  significant capital expenditure will be required in order to install at the contract manufacturers facility equipment that is not common to the amlcd manufacturing process 
in addition  the amount of the capital expenditures required to adapt to fed manufacturing has not been quantified 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to fund such costs  once known 
further  in the event that the company funds such capital expenditures to adapt an amlcd manufacturer s equipment to fed manufacturing  there can be no assurance that such investment will be recovered by the company  especially in the event such manufacturing partnership is not successful 
the company currently does not expect to have its fed displays manufactured by more than one amlcd manufacturer in the foreseeable future 
should the company be successful in establishing a contract manufacturing relationship  the company s reliance on a single contract manufacturer will involve several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required products  and reduced control over the price  timeliness of delivery  reliability and quality of finished products 
any inability to obtain timely deliveries of products having acceptable qualities or any circumstance that would cause the company to delay the shipment of its products could damage relationships with customers and have a material adverse effect on the company 
competition and competing technologies 
the market for flat panel display products is intensely competitive and is expected to remain intensely competitive 
the market is currently dominated by products utilizing liquid crystal display technology 
lcd technology has continued to improve  and there can be no assurance that advances in lcd technology will not overcome its current limitations 
in addition  the recent substantial increases in world wide manufacturing capacity of fpds and the entrance of new competitors in the fpd market may cause over supply conditions leading to dramatic reductions in the price of fpds 
in order to effectively compete  the company could be required to increase the performance of its products or to reduce prices 
in the event of price reductions  the company s ability to maintain gross margins would depend on its ability to reduce its cost of sales 
there are a number of domestic and international companies developing and marketing display devices using alternative technologies  such as vacuum fluorescent displays  electroluminescent panels and plasma panels 
in addition  some of the basic fed technology is in the public domain and  as a result  the company has a number of potential direct competitors developing fed displays 
in the event that efforts by the company s competitors result in the development of products that offer significant advantages over the company s products  and the company is unable to improve its technology or develop or acquire alternative technology that is more competitive  the company would be adversely affected 
no assurance of market acceptance 
the potential size and timing of market opportunities targeted by pixtech and the members of the fed alliance are uncertain 
the company anticipates marketing its displays to original equipment manufacturers oems  and its success will depend on whether oems select the company s products for incorporation into their products and upon their successful introduction of such products  as well as the successful commercialization of products developed by members of the fed alliance 
there can be no assurance that demand for any particular product will be sustained or that new markets will develop as expected by the company  or at all 
the failure of existing and new markets to develop as expected by the company or to be receptive to pixtech s products would have a material adverse effect on the company 
patents and protection of proprietary technology 
the company s ability to compete effectively with other companies will depend  in part  on the ability of the company to maintain the proprietary nature of its technology 
although the company has been granted  has filed applications for and has been licensed under a number of patents in the united states and foreign countries  there can be no assurance as to the degree of protection offered by these patents  as to the likelihood that pending patents will be issued or as to the validity or enforceability of any issued patents 
patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months  the company cannot be certain that it was the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on such inventions 
in addition  because of the developmental stage of the company  claims that the company s products infringe on the proprietary rights of others are more likely to be asserted after commencement of commercial sales incorporating the company s technology 
although the company believes that its products do not infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that other third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company or that such claims will not be successful 
there can also be no assurance that competitors will not infringe the company s patents 
even successful defense and prosecution of patent suits are both costly and time consuming 
an adverse outcome in a suit in which the company asserts its patent rights could result in the loss of such rights  and could subject the company to substantial costs and diversion of company resources 
foreign exchange 
a large percentage of the company s net assets and of the company s costs is expressed in french francs 
fluctuations of the parity of the us dollar versus french franc may cause significant foreign exchange gains or losses 
other important factors which may impact upon the achievement of such goals and forward looking statements are set forth in exhibit to this form k  all of which are incorporated herein by reference 
no assurance may be given that the company s strategic goals and other forward looking statements discussed in this section and elsewhere in this form k will be achieved
