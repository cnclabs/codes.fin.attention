as outlined in note of notes to the company financial statements  the company amended its senior credit facility in january to increase the amount available for borrowings thereunder to  from  new term loans in the amount of  as well as a  seller s note  were obtained to finance the mattison acquisition see note of notes to the company financial statements 
the balance under the new senior credit facility at july   is comprised of  in term loans and a revolving credit agreement which provides for borrowings up to  interest on outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement is payable monthly in arrears at above the prime rate or  at the company s option  at alternative rates based on libor 
the effective rate based on libor was at july  the amount the company may borrow under the revolving credit agreement is based upon a formula related to the company s eligible accounts receivable and inventories  reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
unused borrowings available at july   were  the first and second term loans of  and  respectively  require monthly principal payments of beginning november   and beginning june   respectively

the company expects to continue to provide liquidity and finance its ongoing operational needs primarily through internally generated funds 
recent events on august   the machine tool group laid off hourly production workers and salaried employees as part of the consolidation of the former services group and the operations of national acme 
the reorganization  which is expected to contribute to annual cost reductions in excess of  when completed  calls for a change to outsourcing a major portion of national acme s parts which had been produced internally 
the parts being outsourced are used in the manufacture of new acme gridley machines and are sold separately in the aftermarket 
as a result of planning difficulties encountered during the changeover to outsourcing  fiscal first quarter net sales and net earnings per share are expected to be approximately  to  and approximately to per share lower  respectively  than in the first quarter of fiscal difficulties encountered during the changeover to outsourcing were primarily a failure to adequately identify and source some of the parts needed for first and second quarter new machine production and aftermarket sales 
although the company expects the problem to be worked out in the second quarter  it is still too early to forecast second quarter results 
outlook total fiscal earnings  while reduced in the first and second quarters of the year  are still expected to exceed fiscal results 
the company plans to continue expanding product and service offerings  both internally and through strategic acquisitions  while continuing to identify and implement additional cost savings measures 
the company s growth strategy also includes strategic acquisitions  in addition to growth in its present businesses 
a significant acquisition would require additional borrowings 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain financing for a significant acquisition on acceptable terms 
during fiscal and  the company recorded pre tax charges of  to accrue for or settle three separate lawsuits  which preceded or resulted from the initial public offering in march at this time  all suits have been settled and the company is not a party to any legal proceeding the outcome of which  in management s opinion  would have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
cautionary factors the discussions in this document may include certain forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those reflected by the forward looking statements contained in this document and a number of factors may affect future results  liquidity and capital resources 
these factors include the fact that the company derives a substantial portion of its sales from cyclical industries  including the automotive  aerospace and housing industries  the ability to introduce new products in a timely fashion  the pace of technological changes affecting the products manufactured and services provided by the company  the company s substantial debt service requirements  much of which are based on variable rates  the dependence of the company s growth on acquisitions and the company s ability to finance such acquisitions and to profitably integrate the acquired operations  the level of margins achievable in the markets served by the company  and the ability to continue to minimize operating expenses 
although the company believes it has the business strategy and resources needed for improved operations  future sales and margin trends cannot be reliably predicted 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on the company s net sales or net income during the last three fiscal years 
borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at short term rates 
increases in the prevailing rate of inflation could be accompanied by increases in short term interest rates  which could have an adverse impact on the company s net income and cash flow
