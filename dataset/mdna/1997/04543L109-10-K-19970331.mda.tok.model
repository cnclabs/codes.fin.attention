such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be materially differenct from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks and others are discussed elsewhere herein or in other documents filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
limited operating history  anticipated operating losses 
the company has a limited operating history 
the company realized net income of  for the year ended december   a loss of  for the year ended december  and a loss of  for the one month ended december  there can be no assurance that losses will not be incurred in the future 
the company anticipates that each residence will have an operating loss prior to depreciation  rent or interest  if any of  during the first three to four months of operation 
to the extent the company sells a residence and leases it back or otherwise finances it within four months of the commencement of operations  the aggregate loss may increase by up to an additional  the company currently plans to open to residences in of which eight had received certificates of occupancy by february  the company estimates that the aggregate losses to be incurred during due to the of opening new buildings will range from 
million to million 
the success of the company s future operations is directly tied to the expansion of its operational base 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience unforeseen expenses  difficulties  complications and delays in connection with the expansion of its operational base which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
no assurance as to ability to develop or acquire additional assisted living residences 
the company s prospects for growth are directly affected by its ability to develop and  a lesser extent  acquire additional assisted living residences 
while the company currently plans to open to residences in and  there can be no assurance that such residences will be completed during this time frame  or  that they will be successful once completed 
the success of the company s growth strategy will also depend upon  among other factors  the company s ability to obtain government licenses and approvals  the company s ability to obtain financing and the competitive environment for development and acquisitions 
the nature of such licenses and approvals and the timing and likelihood of obtaining them vary widely from state to state  depending upon the residence  or its operation  and the type of services to be provided 
the successful development of additional assisted living facilities will involve a number of risks  including the possibility that the company may be unable to locate suitable sites at acceptable prices or may be unable to obtain  or may experience delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
the company is dependent upon these permits and authorizations to construct and operate its residences and any delay or inability to obtain such permits could adversely affect the results of operations 
the company may also incur construction costs that exceed original estimates  may not compete construction projects on schedule and may experience competition in the search for suitable development sites 
the company relies on third party general contractors to construct its new assisted living facilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties in working with general contractors and subcontractors  which could result in increased construction costs and delays 
further  facility development is subject to a number of contingencies over which the company will have little control and that may adversely affect project cost and completion time  including shortages of  or the inability to obtain labor or materials  the inability of the general contractor or subcontractors to perform under their contracts  strikes  adverse weather conditions and change in applicable laws or regulations or in the method of applying such laws and regulations 
accordingly  if the company is unable to achieve its development plans  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing or acquiring any particular residence  that the company s rapid expansion will not adversely affect its operations or that any residences developed or acquired by the company will be successful 
the various risks associated with the company s development or acquisition of assisted living residences and uncertainties regarding the profitability of such operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
need for additional financing to fund future development and acquisitions 
to achieve its growth objectives  the company will need to obtain sufficient financial resources to fund its development  construction and acquisition activities 
the estimated cost to complete and fund start up losses for the new facilities that will be developed by december  is between million and million  accordingly  the company s future growth will depend on its ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms 
the company will  from time to time  seek additional funding through public and or private financing sources  including equity and or debt financing 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  the company s stockholders may experience dilution 
there can be no assurance that adequate funding will be available as needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
a lack of available funds may require the company to delay or eliminate all or some of its development projects and acquisition plans 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the company s aggregate annual fixed debt and lease payment obligations currently total approximately million 
these fixed payment obligations will significantly increase as the company pursues its development plan 
failure to meet these obligations may result in the company being in default of its financing agreements and  as a consequence  the company may lose its ability to operate any individual residence or other residences which may be cross defaulted 
there can no assurance that the company will generate sufficient cash flow to meet its current or future obligations 
the company has not historically covered its fixed charges with earnings 
in addition  the company anticipates that future development of residences may be financed with construction loans  and  therefore  there is a risk that  upon completion of construction  permanent financing for newly developed residences may not be available or may be available only on terms that are unfavorable or unacceptable to the company 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
geographic concentration  dependence on state medicaid waiver programs as of february   approximately of the company s properties are located in the state of texas and approximately are located in the state of oregon  therefore  the company is dependent on the economies of texas and oregon and  to a certain extent  on the continued funding of state medicaid waiver programs 
the company has operated residences in oregon since december in addition  the company began operating residences in texas and washington in july and december  respectively 
during the years ended and  direct payments received from state medicaid agencies accounted for approximately and  respectively of the company s revenue while the tenant paid portion of medicaid residents accounted for approximately and of the company s revenue during these periods 
the company expects that state medicaid reimbursement programs will constitute a significant source of revenue for the company 
the company intends to continue developing and operating assisted living residences in other states 
adverse changes in general economic factors affecting these states respective health care industries or in these states laws and regulatory environment  including medicaid reimbursement rates  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
possible volatility of stock price the market price of the common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors and events  including the liquidity of the market for the common stock  variations in the company s operating results  new statutes or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing statutes or regulations affecting the health care industry generally or assisted living residence businesses in particular 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuation also may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
dependence on senior management and skilled personnel the company depends  and will continue to depend  upon the services of dr 
wilson  its chief executive officer and president  connie baldwin  its director of operations and stephen gordon  its chief administrative officer and chief financial officer 
the company has entered into an employment agreement with dr 
wilson and has obtained a  key employee insurance policy covering her life 
company is also dependent upon its ability to attract and retain management personnel who will be responsible for the day to day operations of each residence 
the loss of the services of any or all of such officers or the company s inability to attract additional management personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
dependence on reimbursement by third party payors a portion of the company s revenues will be dependent upon reimbursement from third party payors  including state medicaid programs and private insurers 
for the years ended december   and the one month ended december   the company received  as a percentage of total revenue  under medicaid programs  and  respectively 
furthermore  there can be no assurance the company s proportionate percentage of revenue received from medicaid programs will not increase 
the revenues and profitability of the company will be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care by attempting to lower reimbursement rates  increasing case management review of services and negotiating reduced contract pricing 
in an attempt to reduce the federal and certain state budget deficits  there have been  and management expects that there will continue to be  a number of proposals to limit medicaid reimbursement in general 
adoption of any such proposals at either the federal or the state level could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
government regulation 
health care is an area of extensive and frequent regulatory change 
changes in the laws or new interpretations of existing laws can have a significant effect on methods of doing business  cost of doing business and amounts of reimbursement from governmental and other payors 
the company is and will continue to be subject to varying degrees of regulation and licensing by health or social service agencies and other regulatory authorities in the various states and localities in which it operates or intends to operate 
as a provided of services under the medicaid program in the united states  the company is subject to medicaid fraud an abuse law  violations of which may result in civil and criminal penalties and exclusions from participation in the medicaid program 
the company at all times attempts to comply with all applicable fraud and abuse laws  however  there can be no assurance that administrative or judicial interpretation of existing laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
the success of the company will be dependent in part upon its ability to satisfy the applicable regulations and requirements and to procure and maintain required licenses 
the company s operations could also be adversely affected by  among other things  regulatory developments such as mandatory increases in the scope and quality of care to be afford residents and revisions in licensing and certification standards 
currently  no federal rules explicitly define or regulate assisted living 
in addition  federal and state laws currently exist restricting health care providers from referring patients to affiliated entities 
the company believes that its operations do not presently violate these referral laws 
however  there can be no assurance that federal  state or local laws or regulatory procedures which might adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects will not be expanded or imposed 
staffing and labor costs the company will compete with other providers of long term care with respect to attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
the company will also be dependent upon the available labor pool of low wage employees 
a shortage of nurses and or trained personnel may require the company to enhance its wage and benefits package in order to compete 
no assurance can be given that the company s labor costs will not increase  or that  if they do increase  they can be matched by corresponding increases in revenues 
competition the long term care industry is highly competitive and the company expects that the assisted living business  in particular  will become more competitive in the future 
the company will be competing with numerous other companies providing similar long term care alternatives  such as home health agencies  life care at home  community based service programs  retirement communities and convalescent centers 
the company expects that as assisted living receives increased attention and the number of states which include assisted living in their medicaid waiver programs increases  competition will grow from new markets entrants  including publicly and privately held companies focusing primarily on assisted living 
nursing facilities that provide long term care services are also a source of competition to the company 
moreover  in the implementation of the company s expansion program  the company expects to face competition for development and acquisitions of assisted living residences 
some of the company s present and potential competitors are significantly larger and have  or may obtain  greater financial resources than those of the company 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter increased competition in the future which could limit its ability to attract residents or expand its business and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
difficulties of managing rapid growth the company expects that the number of residences which it owns  leases or otherwise operates will increase substantially as it pursues its growth strategy 
this rapid growth will place significant demands on the company s management resources 
the company s ability to manage its growth effectively will require it to continue to expand its operational  financial and management information systems and to continue to attract  train  motivate  manage and retain key employees 
if the company is unable to manage its growth effectively  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
liability and insurance the provision of health care services entails an inherent risk of liability 
in recent years  participants in the long term care industry have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging malpractice or related legal theories  many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs 
the company currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover such claims and the company believes that its insurance is in keeping with industry standards 
there can be no assurance  however  that claims in excess of the company s insurance coverage or claims not covered by the company insurance coverage eg  claims for punitive damages will not arise 
a successful claim against the company not covered by  or in excess of  the company s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition and results of operations 
claims against the company regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  may also have a material adverse effect upon the company s ability to attract residents or expand its business and would require management to devote time to matters unrelated to the operation of the company s business 
in addition  the company s insurance policies must be renewed annually 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain liability insurance coverage in the future or that  if such coverage is available  it will be available on acceptable terms 
environmental risks under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the cost of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances  including  without limitation  asbestos containing materials  that could be located on  in or under such property 
such laws and regulations often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
the costs of any required remediation or removal of these substances could be substantial and the liability of an owner or operator as the any property is generally not limited under such laws and regulations and could exceed the property s value and the aggregate assets of the owner or operator 
the presence of these substances or failure to remediate such substances properly may also adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent the property  or to borrow using the property as collateral 
under these laws and regulations  an owner  operator or an entity that arranges for the disposal of hazardous or toxic substances  such as asbestos containing materials  at a disposal site may also be liable for the costs of any required remediation or removal of the hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal site 
in connection with the ownership or operation of its properties  the company could be liable for these costs  as well as certain other costs  including governmental fines and injuries to persons or properties 
as a result  the presence  with or without the company s knowledge  of hazardous or toxic substances at any property held or operated by the company  or acquired or operated by the company in the future  could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental audits performed on the company s properties have not revealed any significant environmental liability that management believes would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
no assurance can be given that existing environmental audits with respect to any other company s properties reveal all environmental liabilities
