in exchange for these payments collectively  global capitation  medpartners  through its affiliated physicians  provides the majority of covered healthcare services to enrollees and contracts with hospitals and other healthcare providers for the balance of the covered services 
these relationships provide physicians with the opportunity to operate under a variety of payor arrangements and increase their patient flow 
the company offers medical group practices and independent physicians a range of affiliation models which are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these affiliations are carried out by the acquisition of ppm entities or practice assets  either for cash or through equity exchange  or by affiliation on a contractual basis

the following table sets forth the earnings summary by service area for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands physician services net revenue    operating income    margin pharmaceutical services net revenue    operating income    margin specialty services net revenue    operating income    margin corporate services operating loss    percentage of total net revenue physician practice management services the company s ppm revenues have increased substantially over the past three years primarily due to growth in prepaid enrollment  existing practice growth and new practice affiliations 
of the total ppm revenue  billion can be attributed to acquisitions accounted for as either poolings of interests or purchase transactions made during the year 
the company s ppm operations in the western region of the country function in a predominantly prepaid environment 
the company s ppm operations in the other regions of the country are in predominantly fee for service environments with limited but increasing managed care penetration 
the following table sets forth the breakdown of net revenue for the ppm services area for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands prepaid    fee for service    other    total net revenue from ppm service area    the company s prepaid revenue reflects the number of hmo enrollees for whom it receives monthly capitation payments 
the company receives professional capitation to provide physician services and institutional capitation to provide hospital care and other non professional services 
the table below reflects the growth in enrollment for professional and global capitation at december  professional enrollees    global enrollees professional and institutional    total enrollees    during  the company consolidated the majority of its acquisitions into its management infrastructure  eliminating substantial overhead expenses and improving integration of medical  administrative and operational management 
the integration of various acquisitions into existing networks has allowed the conversion of thousands of prepaid enrollees from professional capitation to global capitation 
this integration has been a significant factor in increasing operating margins in the ppm service area from in to in the company has developed strong relationships with many of the national and regional managed care organizations and has demonstrated its ability to deliver high quality  cost effective care 
the company is strategically positioned to capitalize on the industry s continued evolution toward a prepaid environment  specifically by increasing the number of prepaid enrollees and converting existing enrollees from professional to global capitation 
these changes are expected to result in significant internal growth 
the company has continued to acquire high quality groups of emergency physicians and radiologists who believe in the value of providing increasingly cost effective care 
the reputation and strong local presence of new and existing hospital based groups provide a substantial advantage in the competition for contracts with emergency room and radiology departments 
the excellent reputation and leadership of these groups continue to provide opportunities for new contracts 
in addition to the increased revenues and operational efficiencies realized through acquisition and consolidation  the company is profiting from synergies produced by the exchange of ideas among physicians and managers across geographical boundaries and varied areas of specialization 
the ppm service area  for example  has established medical management committees that meet monthly to discuss implementation of the best medical management techniques to assist the company s affiliated physicians in delivering the highest quality of care at lower costs in a consistent fashion 
the company is capitalizing on the knowledge of its western groups  which have significant experience operating in a prepaid environment  to transfer the best practices to other groups in markets with increasing managed care penetration 
through interaction between physicians and managers from various medical groups during the fourth quarter of  significant cost savings have been identified at several of the company s larger affiliated groups 
the ppm service area has also created a medical advisory committee  which is developing procedures for the identification  packaging and dissemination of the best clinical practices within the company s medical groups 
the committee also provides the company s affiliated physicians a forum to discuss innovative ways to improve the delivery of healthcare 
the company has also initiated integration efforts between the ppm  pbm and disease management areas 
a project is in process to integrate patient care data from several of the company s affiliated clinics with the pbm s healthcare information system 
through this database  which combines medical and claims data with the prescription information tracked by the pbm area  the company will have access to the industry s most complete and detailed collection of information on successful treatment patterns 
another synergy arising from integration is the opportunity which the existing pbm infrastructure affords to affiliated physician groups to further expand services by providing pharmacy services ranging from fee for service retail claims processing to full drug capitation programs 
the company is also beginning to integrate the disease management area s expertise in an effort to formulate and implement disease management programs for the company 
pharmacy benefit management services pharmaceutical services revenues continue to exhibit sustained growth 
this growth is entirely internal and has not been supplemented by acquisitions 
key factors contributing to this growth include high customer retention  additional penetration of retained customers  new customer contracts and drug cost inflation 
these growth factors were partially offset in and by selective non renewal of certain accounts not meeting threshold profitability levels 
the preponderance of pharmaceutical services revenue is earned on a fee for service basis through contracts covering one to three year periods 
revenues for selected types of services are earned based on a percentage of savings achieved or on a per enrollee or per member basis  however  these revenues are not material to total revenues 
operating income experienced accelerated growth in and while margins fell slightly in to but returned to a level in operating income and margins in were enhanced by reduced information systems costs achieved through renegotiation of a contract with an outsource service vendor  continued improvements in the acquisition costs of drugs  increased penetration of higher margin value oriented services and an overall reduction in selling and administrative expenses 
partially offsetting these cost reductions were continued declines in prices to customers 
margins in pharmaceutical services are also affected by the mix between mail and retail service revenues 
margins on mail related service revenues currently are higher than those on retail service revenues 
revenues in both mail and retail services continue to grow  although  the growth rate of retail services in and was greater than the growth rate of mail services 
in  retail service revenues grew to represent nearly of pbm revenues 
the company has little or no influence over certain other factors  including demographics of the population served and plan design  which  can affect the mix between mail and retail services 
consequently  margin percentage trends alone are not a sufficient indication of progress 
the company s pricing and underwriting strategies are closely linked to its working capital and asset management strategies and focus on return on investment and overall improvements in return on capital deployed in the business 
the company has recently reorganized its sales and corporate accounts management activities into eight geographic and two additional specialty areas 
this will enable the company to improve its account retention  client service and growth initiatives even further as a result of increased accountability and focus 
as mentioned under physician practice management services  the company is pursuing a number of ppm and pbm integration opportunities 
specialty services specialty services concentrates on providing high quality products and services in the home 
domestically  these services focus on low incidence chronic diseases 
internationally  the company has established home care businesses in canada  germany  france  the netherlands  the united kingdom  puerto rico and japan  where it is expanding into new services in response to transforming health care delivery systems in these countries 
revenues for specialty services have declined as a result of managed care pricing pressures  restructuring of benefit plans by payors and reduced reimbursement from medicaid and other state agency payors 
for the hemophilia business  federal government programs providing special pricing to qualified organizations who may be competitors have impacted revenues negatively 
to offset these declines  the company is attempting to launch new products and services including the opening of a pbm in the netherlands in the fourth quarter of and a multiple sclerosis ms therapy service in the us in addition to pricing pressures  particularly in growth deficiency therapy  operating expenses and cost of service expenses rose due to programs targeted at launching the company s new ms therapy service  an expanded payor marketing initiative and an initiative targeted at attaining accreditation by the joint committee on accreditation of healthcare organizations for the nationwide system of pharmacies

the most significant physician practice acquisition during this period was the cigna medical group which was acquired in january this acquisition accounted for of the new practice revenue 
the increase in pbm net revenue is attributable to pharmaceutical price increases  the addition of new customers  further penetration of existing customers and the sale of new products 
operating income for the ppm and pbm services areas increased and  respectively  for compared to this growth was the result of higher net revenues in both areas and increases in operating margins resulting from the spreading of fixed overhead expenses over a larger revenue base and continued integration of operations in the ppm services area 
operating income and margins declined in the corresponding periods for the specialty services area as a result of lower volumes in the hemophilia business and continued pricing pressures for growth hormone products 
included in the pre tax loss for were merger expenses totaling million related to the business combinations with caremark  ppsi and several other entities  the major components of which are listed in note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for the years ended december  and net revenue for the year ended december  was  million  an increase of million  or  over the year ended december  the increase in net revenue resulted primarily from affiliation with new physician practices  the increase in prepaid enrollees at existing affiliated physician practices and the increase in pbm net revenue  which accounted for million  million  and million of the increase in net revenue  respectively

this growth is the result of higher net revenues in both areas 
the ppm service area also had a significant increase in operating margin  in to in  which resulted from the leveraging of fixed overhead expenses over a substantially larger revenue base  integration of operations and the impact of the varying margins of new physician practice affiliations 
operating income and margins declined in the corresponding periods for the specialty services areas as a result of pricing pressures for growth hormone products 
factors that may affect future results the future operating results and financial condition of the company are dependent on the company s ability to market its services profitably  successfully increase market share and manage expense growth relative to revenue growth 
the future operating results and financial condition of the company may be affected by a number of additional factors  including the company s growth strategy  which involves the ability to raise the capital required to support growth  competition for expansion opportunities  integration risks and dependence on hmo enrollee growth  efforts to control healthcare costs  exposure to professional liability  and pharmacy licensing  healthcare reform and government regulation 
changes in one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the future operating results and financial condition of the company 
the company completed the caremark acquisition in september there are various caremark legal matters which  if materially adversely determined  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition

these expenditures were funded by million derived from equity proceeds and million in net incremental borrowings 
investments in acquisitions and property and equipment are anticipated to continue to be substantial uses of funds in future periods 
the company entered into the billion credit facility  which became effective simultaneously with the closing of the caremark acquisition  on september   replacing its then existing credit facility 
at the company s option  pricing on the credit facility is based on either a debt to cash flow test or the company s senior debt ratings 
no principal is due on the facility until its maturity date of september as of december   there was million outstanding under the facility 
the credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants which include requirements that the company maintain certain financial ratios including minimum net worth  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum indebtedness to cash flow  and establishes certain restrictions on investments  mergers and sales of assets 
additionally  the company is required to obtain bank consent for acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price in excess of million and for which more than half of the consideration is to be paid in cash 
the credit facility is unsecured but provides a negative pledge on substantially all assets of the company 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the covenants in the credit facility

on october   the company completed its tender offer for caremark s million notes due august  of the million principal amount of such notes outstanding  million principal amount were tendered and purchased 
the total consideration for each  principal amount of outstanding notes tendered was 
the company s growth strategy requires substantial capital for the acquisition of ppm businesses and assets of physician practices  and for their effective integration  operation and expansion 
affiliated physician practices may also require capital for renovation  expansion and additional medical equipment and technology 
the company believes that its existing cash resources  the use of the company s common stock for selected practice and other acquisitions and available borrowings under the billion credit facility or any successor credit facility  will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated acquisition  expansion and working capital needs for the next twelve months 
the company expects from time to time to raise additional capital through the issuance of long term or short term indebtedness or the issuance of additional equity securities in private or public transactions  at such times as management deems appropriate and the market allows in order to meet the capital needs of the company 
there can be no assurance that acceptable financing for future acquisitions or for the integration and expansion of existing networks can be obtained 
any of such financings could result in increased interest and amortization expense  decreased income to fund future expansion and dilution of existing equity positions
