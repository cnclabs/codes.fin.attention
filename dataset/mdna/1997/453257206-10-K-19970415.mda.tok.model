sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets being developed  based on fair value  when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
assets held for sale are to be carried at the lower of cost or fair value less the costs to sell 
prior to  real estate inventories are carried at the lower of historical cost or estimated net realizable value 
net realizable value is the price obtainable in the future for parcels as improved with a completed housing unit  net of disposal and holding costs including interest  without provision for future profit and without discounting future cash receipts to present value 
the estimation process in determining the value of real estate inventories is inherently uncertain and relies to a considerable extent on current and future economic and market conditions  the availability of suitable financing to fund holding  development and construction activities  and the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness 
such economic and market conditions may affect management s development and marketing plans 
accordingly  the ultimate realization of the company s real estate inventories is dependent upon future events and conditions that may cause realizations to differ from amounts presently estimated 
in  the company determined that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by various real estate holdings were less than the assets carrying amounts 
an impairment allowance  which writes these assets down to fair value was established at december  totaling  of which  relates to properties in the high desert and  relates to a property in riverside county

accordingly  several measures were initiated  including requests that certain sellers substantially restructure the terms of their debt including extending the maturity date  reducing or eliminating payment and accrual of interest and deferring principal payments 
the company also identified certain properties that should be deeded back to the sellers in full satisfaction of the remaining debt outstanding 
in the company commenced negotiations with six land sellers from whom the company purchased land in the high desert 
the company owned these properties subject to seller loans that had current or approaching maturity dates 
in this regard  the company recorded a charge to operations in of million 
the balance of the related real estate inventories and indebtedness at december  was million 
in  the company deeded property with a book value of million back to four of these land sellers in satisfaction of million in indebtedness 
continuing negotiations may result either in extensions of maturity dates and or other adjustments to the seller notes  or deedbacks of the two remaining properties with a book value of million to the sellers in satisfaction of million in indebtedness outstanding at december  during the company also reduced the scope of one community in riverside county which resulted in the write off of approximately  of previously capitalized costs associated with architectural development and marketing activities 
as of december   the company was still in the process of deeding back land to the seller from whom the company purchased the property that will result in a reduction of real estate inventories of million in satisfaction of million of indebtedness outstanding at december in  the company established a reserve in the amount of  to cover the write off of previously capitalized costs associated with an under performing subdivision in the high desert area 
also in  the balance of the land in this subdivision was returned to the original seller pursuant to the terms of the purchase contract and the remaining debt of  was deemed satisfied 
in  the company commenced the process of deeding property back to nine other land sellers from whom the company purchased land in the high desert 
in this regard  the company recorded a charge to operations in of million 
the balance of the related real estate inventories and indebtedness at december  was million 
deed backs of real estate with a book value and related indebtedness of million and million occurred in and  respectively 
as of december   the company was still in the process of deeding back land to one of these land sellers that will result in a reduction of real estate inventories of million in satisfaction of million of indebtedness outstanding at december  this land was deeded back in january during the company also closed four communities and reduced the scope of three other communities in the high desert which resulted in the acceleration of the write off of previously capitalized costs associated with its regional development and marketing activities of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that there will be no additional write downs of land inventory or write offs of costs in the future 
minority partners share minority partners share represents the interest of affiliated limited partners in partnerships consolidated in the company s financial statements 
pursuant to the reorganization in april  all interests of minority partners were eliminated except for the interest of partners in palmdale vistas 
in  the company formed three new limited partnerships  ferhp  triumph and spirit ferhp and triumph are consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the minority partners share of losses was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes represents federal income taxes based on net income loss computed at the effective federal tax rate plus state income taxes computed at the effective tax rate  net of federal tax benefit  as adjusted for regulations affecting net operating losses 
in  the company recorded an income tax provision of consisting of a deferred tax benefit of million and a valuation allowance of million 
in  the company recorded an income tax provision of million consisting of a deferred tax benefit of million and a valuation allowance of million 
in  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million  consisting of income taxes receivable of million due to the carryback of the company s net operating loss and a deferred tax benefit of million 
in order to fully realize the recorded net deferred tax asset of million  the company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately million 
the deferred tax asset is based on current applicable corporate income tax rates 
future changes in tax rates will be reflected in the valuation of the deferred tax asset in the period of change 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes requires  among other things  the recognition of deferred tax assets for the estimated future tax effects attributable to net deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards 
sfas no 
further requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the future realization of the deferred tax asset must be evaluated along with the accumulated differences caused by other tax and book basis differences 
uncertainties exist due to the reduced level of closings  revenues and earnings resulting from the sale of the company s phoenix and las vegas divisions  the need to raise capital for new land acquisitions and current business operations 
accordingly  the company has provided a cumulative million valuation allowance at december  to reserve against the deferred tax asset as a result of these uncertainties 
at such time as it becomes more likely than not that portions of the additional tax asset will be realized in the future  the valuation allowance can be adjusted 
the company believes that during the time period in which the deferred tax asset can be utilized it will generate sufficient income to realize the net deferred tax asset 
it is difficult to assess the ultimate timing of the realization of the deferred tax asset 
no assurances can be given regarding the realization of the deferred tax asset or that the company will not have to record a further valuation allowance against future tax benefits 
backlog the company s homes are offered for sale in advance of their construction 
historically  the company has entered into standard sales contracts for a majority of the homes to be built in the phase of a project before construction commences 
such sales contracts are usually subject to certain contingencies such as the buyer s ability to qualify for financing and or the sale of an existing home 
homes covered by such sales contracts  as well as completed homes covered by such sales contracts  are considered by the company as its backlog 
the company does not recognize revenue on homes covered by such contracts until the escrows are closed and title is transferred 
the following table sets forth the company s backlog at the dates indicated december  southern california division high desert riverside county phoenix division las vegas division number of homes aggregate sales value    average sales price    in december the company sold its phoenix and las vegas home building divisions to an unrelated third party 
see item business general 
the company s backlog at any particular date is subject to substantial variation and is dependent upon several factors including the number of homes then available for sale  prevailing market conditions and the length of time necessary to complete the closing of home sales subject to pending contracts 
the company has generally experienced a rapid increase in backlog during periods in which it holds a grand opening for one of its projects 
in the company had three grand openings compared to four grand openings in the company s backlog changed insignificantly in from due to a fewer number of grand openings and active projects  and declining inventory available for sale 
the aggregate sales value of the units in backlog decreased by million or  and the average sales price of homes in backlog decreased by  or due to a change in the mix of homes offered for sale 
during the latter part of  the company opened no new projects  compared with six in also  the company sold its phoenix and las vegas divisions in december  which contributed units to its backlog at december  as a result  the company s backlog decreased to from units at december  and  respectively  a decrease of units or 
the aggregate sales value of homes in backlog was million and million at december  and  respectively  a decrease of million or 
no assurances can be given that homes in backlog will result in actual closings because cancellations vary from period to period 
the company believes that cancellations have been relatively high in recent periods  reflecting the weak economic conditions that have existed in the southern california markets  increased competition  higher interest rates and the inability of certain potential homebuyers to qualify for mortgage financing 
net orders net orders represents the number of homes for which the company has received signed sales contracts and purchase deposits during the period  net of cancellations 
the following table sets forth the company s net orders by region for the dates indicated for the year ended december  southern california division high desert riverside county phoenix division las vegas division total in december the company sold its phoenix and las vegas home building divisions to an unrelated third party 
see item business general 
net new orders declined to homes from homes for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in southern california net orders was homes or in the decrease in southern california net orders is attributable to market weakness as well as fewer subdivisions and declining inventory available for sale 
net new orders declined to homes from homes for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company experienced substantial decreases in net orders in both its southern california markets partially offset by increases in net orders in phoenix and las vegas during the first eleven months of the decrease in southern california net orders was attributable to continued market weakness in the high desert region  as well as fewer subdivisions and declining inventory available for sale in both the high desert and riverside county 
the increase in phoenix and las vegas was attributable to having more homes available for sale during variability in quarterly results the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  significant variability in its operating results 
see item financial statements and supplementary data  note this variability may cause the company s overall results of operations to fluctuate significantly on a period to period basis  and revenues anticipated to occur in a fiscal period may not be earned until subsequent fiscal periods 
many factors that contribute to this variability  including i the timing and mix of home deliveries  ii the company s ability to continue to acquire additional land on favorable terms for future developments  iii the condition of the real estate markets and the economy in general  iv the cyclical nature of the home building industry and changes in prevailing interest rates  v cost and availability of materials and labor  and vi delays in construction schedules caused by timing of inspections and approvals by regulatory agencies  strikes at subcontractors and adverse weather conditions 
the company s historical financial results are not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results and  in general  the company expects its financial results to vary from project to project 
the company s revenue and net income may also vary substantially as a result of variations in the number of projects at which the company is closing the sale of homes at any one time 
in addition  the sale of operations in phoenix and las vegas has resulted in a reduction in the level of closings and revenues  and has had an adverse effect on earnings 
inflation the company  as well as the homebuilding industry in general  may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  primarily because of higher land acquisition  land development  construction and interest costs 
in addition  higher interest rates may significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers and the cost of financing the company s land acquisition  development of real estate and construction of homes 
the company believes that higher mortgage interest rates during much of that increased again in the second quarter and the early part of the third quarter of  has had a negative impact on home sales  particularly on entry level buyers 
the company attempts to pass any increases in its costs due to inflation to its buyers through increased selling prices of its homes 
however  there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on the company s future results of operations 
adoption of accounting standards there were no new accounting pronouncements that could have a significant effect on the company s financial statements for any period presented 
liquidity and capital resources the homebuilding industry is capital intensive and often involves high leverage and significant up front expenditures to acquire land and begin development 
accordingly  the company incurs substantial indebtedness to finance its homebuilding activities and its business and earnings are substantially dependent on its ability to obtain bank or other debt financing on acceptable terms 
the financial statements set forth in item financial statements and supplementary data have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern 
in addition  the company s business plan calls for substantial future expenditures relating to the acquisition and construction of new projects 
no assurances can be given that anticipated cash flows from operations and the company s ability to borrow from various lenders will be sufficient to fund most of its planned expenditures 
the company currently is attempting to raise additional needed capital for both ongoing working capital and the acquisition of land for future projects in southern california 
the company is in active discussions with certain capital sources and is optimistic that it can successfully complete a transaction in however  no agreements between the company and these potential capital sources have been signed  and no assurances can be given whether or when the company will enter into a definitive agreement with any source or  if entered into  what the precise terms of the agreement will be 
if the company is not successful in obtaining sufficient capital in to fund its planned expenditures  some or all of its projects may be significantly delayed or abandoned 
any such delay or abandonment could result in cost increases and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is unable to predict whether it will be successful in raising such capital  nor can any assurances be given that  if successful  the capital will be raised on terms favorable to the company 
accordingly  absent raising capital  the company s ability to continue its current level of business operations and finance the acquisition of additional land for the delivery of future homes will be greatly impaired 
additionally  as a result of the limited amount of available working capital  the company has not paid all of its subcontractors and suppliers on a current basis 
numerous subcontractors and suppliers have filed liens  and some are pursuing further legal action  including the filing of complaints 
the company has negotiated payment arrangements  as appropriate  in an effort to settle these claims and release the liens
