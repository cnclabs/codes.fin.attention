equipment is normally placed with a customer for a day evaluation period 
following the evaluation  the equipment may be sold  leased or rented to the customer or returned to the company 
this program has required and will continue to require a significant capital investment by the company 
at december  the company had approximately  available under lines of credit with its banks and had no material commitments for the purchase of capital assets 
as the company continues to grow  and if losses in the company s european operations continue at a significant level  there will be a need to obtain additional financing to fund the company s operations and instrumentation program and to increase building and equipment capacity 
although the company does not have any funding commitments  to the extent that working capital needs cannot be financed through internally generated funds  the company believes that additional debt  equity and lease financing can be obtained 
see the company s proxy statement for a discussion of the financing needs associated with the acquisition of the diagnostics business of fresenius ag 
industry trends there is an increasing effort by governmental agencies worldwide to control rising healthcare costs 
decreasing or eliminating reimbursements to patients for medical expenses that are determined to be discretionary or non essential is one of the methods that is being discussed or has already been implemented 
these efforts are causing the diagnostics market to shift away from the company s more profitable ifa products to the less profitable elisa products  which are less expensive on a cost per test basis to the customer and can be automated 
the trend toward consolidation into larger volume laboratories has also increased the level of automation and related volume discounts 
this trend will continue to put pressure on the company to maintain or decrease the prices of many of its existing products 
the company is aggressively moving to offset these pressures through programs to increase productivity  lower manufacturing costs and expand its distribution network 
as mentioned above  the company assists its customers in automating their operations to gain operating efficiencies by offering laboratory equipment under sales  lease or rental agreements 
under the terms of the lease and rental agreements  the customer commits to purchase a minimum monthly level of product from the company in exchange for the company placing the instrument in the laboratory 
the customer is charged for the reagents plus a charge for the use of the instrument on a pay as you use basis 
this type of program enables the company to sell to larger clinical and hospital laboratories 
however  the program causes downward pressure on gross profit margins on reagent sales due to larger volume purchase discounts 
also because the company does not manufacture the instrumentation  the company realizes a smaller gross profit on the sale of the equipment than on its reagent sales

export sales from the united states in decreased compared to sales 
sales to unaffiliated customers of the company s european operations decreased  principally due to the loss of significant distribution product lines  product shortages and increased competition 
the company s gross profit margin increased from in to in the increase in the gross profit margin  caused by manufacturing efficiencies and lower inventory write offs  was partially offset by the continued shift from the company s ifa products to less profitable elisa products

the company s gross profit margin decreased from in to in the decrease in gross profit margins in is due to the continued shift from the company s ifa products to less profitable elisa products  the increase in instrumentation sales as a percentage of total sales and due to a  write off of excess and obsolete inventories in europe 
also  the company s new duet instrument has higher gross profit margins than other instrument offerings 
selling  general and administrative costs increased from  or of sales in to  or of sales in approximately  of the increase was due to recruiting and relocation costs incurred in hiring a new chief executive officer and president
