overview ride  inc the company is a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of snowboards and related products through its subsidiaries ride snowboard company ride snowboards  ride manufacturing  inc ride manufacturing  formerly known as thermal snowboards  inc  ride canada  inc 
ride canada and smp clothing  inc smp 
the company was founded in september and acquired ride manufacturing in september and smp in october the company also acquired snowboards  inc in september and later merged with and into ride snowboards 
finally  the company acquired cas sports international  inc and cas sports agency  inc 
collectively  cas in august in october  the company transferred substantially all of the canada based operating assets and liabilities of cas  other than fixed assets  into ride canada  a newly formed corporation  and all of the us based operating assets and liabilities of cas into ride snowboards  and sold the cas entities 
the results of operations of these acquired subsidiaries are included in the company s financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition through their applicable dates of disposition 
ride snowboards sells premium to mid range snowboards and related products primarily through specialty snowboard and ski shops and to regional sporting goods stores under the ride   liquid  preston  and cappel brand names 
ride manufacturing is a manufacturer of premium snowboards which are produced principally for ride snowboards 
ride manufacturing also produces a limited number of snowboards for other snowboard companies on an oem basis 
smp designs and manufactures snowboard  surf  skate  motocross and street apparel which is sold through specialty shops under the smp brand name 
ride canada acts as the company s canadian distributor for its ride   liquid  preston  cappel and smp branded products 
until its disposition in october  cas marketed entry level snowboards and related products under various brand names  including marvel  slim  burnt  and pl and on a private label basis  primarily to regional sporting goods stores and large format sporting goods retailers 
in addition  cas sold snowboards and related products on an oem basis to other snowboard companies and bought excess snowboard and sporting goods inventories from manufacturers and sold such products to retailers throughout the world 
the oem and excess inventory portions of the cas business were sold in october while the branded and private label portions of the business were retained by the company and are being operated as the company s special products group spg 
because snowboarding traditionally is a winter sport and the company s sales are concentrated in the northern hemisphere  sales of the company s products predominantly occur in the third and fourth quarters 
since much of the company s operating expense is fixed in nature and is budgeted based on higher third and fourth quarter net sales  a decline in net sales relative to internal expectations would have a significant adverse effect on results of operations 
because relatively lower net sales are realized in the first and second quarters of each year  the company expects to incur operating losses in the first two quarters of the year for the foreseeable future 
in addition to seasonal fluctuations  the company s operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of order shipments  new product introductions  new retailer openings  consumer buying patterns  weather conditions  discretionary spending habits  general economic conditions in the united states and abroad and other factors 
furthermore  the company s gross margins will fluctuate with product mix  the timing of product price adjustments and the mix of international and domestic sales 
the company accumulates a backlog of orders beginning in february as a result of preseason orders placed in connection with winter sports trade shows 
the backlog decreases beginning in late spring as product begins to be shipped and is usually insignificant by the end of the year 
backlog in the snowboarding industry is subject to delay or cancellation 
during the first quarter of  the company s principal japanese distributor requested a decrease in its contractual purchase commitment due to excess inventory conditions in the japanese market 
the company agreed to accept the lower order from this distributor in exchange for that distributor releasing its exclusive rights in japan for certain brands 
subsequently  the company entered into agreements with two other japanese companies for exclusive distribution of the and cappel brands and non exclusive distribution of preston brand boots and bindings 
in the first quarter of  the company terminated its agreement with its japanese distributor of the ride and liquid brands and announced that such brands will be sold directly to retailers in japan in rather than through distributors 
historically  a significant percentage of the company s sales have been to the japanese market 
given the excess inventory conditions in this market  management expects this percentage to decrease significantly in results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales increased in from million in to million in ride manufacturing  and smp contributed a total of million to net sales in  subsequent to their respective acquisition dates  and million in the remaining difference is due to the inclusion of the cas excess inventory and oem businesses for the full year in as opposed to when they were included only through their october  disposition date 
net sales of hard goods defined as snowboards  skateboards  boots and bindings represented of total sales in while soft goods apparel and accessories made up 
in  hard goods comprised of total sales and soft goods 
the increase in soft goods sales is attributable primarily to the inclusion of smp for the entire year in as opposed to when smp was included only from its october  acquisition date 
management expects soft goods sales to continue to increase as a percentage of sales in future periods 
in  net sales in north america made up of total sales with international sales making up the remaining 
in  north american sales comprised and international sales 
the increase in international sales in was attributable primarily to the addition of smp for the entire year in as a majority of that company s sales are to international markets 
with the disposition of the cas businesses and the excess inventory situation in the japanese market  management expects north american sales to comprise a larger percentage of total sales in gross profit decreased from million in to million in while gross margins dropped from in to in these decreases are due to a million inventory write down taken by the company in december this write down was necessitated by excess inventories resulting primarily from canceled commitments from the company s principal japanese distributor 
without the inventory write down  gross margins would have remained at in due to offsetting factors 
first  the addition of ride manufacturing towards the end of allowed the company to manufacture of its branded snowboards in compared to only in cost savings from this change had a positive impact on gross margins 
in addition  the inclusion of a full year of higher margin smp sales in also served to increase gross margins 
offsetting these gains was an aggressive fourth quarter discounting program offered by the company in an attempt to reduce the amount of excess inventory on hand 
as competition in the snowboard industry increases  management expects there to be downward pressure on prices in future periods  especially in the mid to low price points 
in an effort to offset the effect of this trend on margins  the company will seek to increase the percentage of snowboards it manufactures in its own factory and to focus more emphasis on the mid to upper price points in the market 
in addition  the company moved its preston binding operations offshore for to benefit from lower cost of materials and labor outside of the us in thousands operating expenses selling  general administrative   restructuring charges  management transition  total operating expenses   selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was due to the inclusion of the operations for ride manufacturing and smp for the entire year in as well as the increased scope of the company s operations in the primary components of selling  general and administrative expenses were salaries  wages  commissions and other compensation million in and million in  advertising  promotion and team million in and million in and occupancy  depreciation and amortization expense  in and million in 
management expects selling  general and administrative expenses to increase somewhat in as the company invests in growing its key brands and with increased competition as the industry continues to mature 
also included in operating expenses in are million in restructuring charges and million in management transition expenses 
the restructuring charges are associated with the move of the preston binding operations offshore and the withdrawal of snowboard production from two outside snowboard manufacturers used in the primary components of the restructuring charges are write offs of abandoned equipment  tooling and leasehold improvements  accrual of future lease costs and vendor cancellation fees 
the management transition expenses are associated with the change in top management and include contractual severance packages for the company s former chief executive officer  president and senior vice president as well as relocation expenses for new executives 
interest income decreased from  in to  in the decrease was due to higher cash balances on hand in from the company s secondary stock offering in august of and the proceeds from exercise of common stock warrants 
interest expense increased from  in to  in this increase was due to principally to seasonal utilization of the company s line of credit for working capital purposes 
also included in the results is a gain of  on the disposition of the cas excess inventory and oem businesses 
the provision for income taxes represents a effective tax rate for compared with a effective rate for the decrease is due primarily to expense for state income tax purposes lowering the overall tax benefit of the loss 
as a result of the foregoing factors  including the non recurring restructuring charges  inventory write down and management transition expenses  the company s net income decreased from million in to a net loss of million in pro forma discussion the following discussion compares  on a pro forma basis  the and results of operations of the company as if the disposition of the cas excess inventory and oem businesses took place prior to january  pro forma net sales increased from million in to million in the increase is attributable to the inclusion of the ride manufacturing  and smp operations for the full year in and increased acceptance and penetration of ride snowboards brands  offset by decreases in the retained cas branded and private label businesses due to increased competition at the lower distribution levels targeted by these products 
pro forma net sales of hard goods represented of total sales in while soft goods comprised 
in  hard goods made up of pro forma net sales and soft goods represented 
the increase in soft goods sales is attributable primarily to the inclusion of smp for the entire year in in  pro forma net sales in north america comprised of total sales with international sales making up the remaining 
in  north american sales represented of the total and international sales 
the increase in international sales in was attributable primarily to the inclusion of smp for the full year as a significant portion of that company s sales are to international markets 
pro forma gross margins dropped from in to in again  this decrease was due to the million inventory write down in without the inventory write down  pro forma gross margins would have remained at in the pro forma net loss for  adjusted for the operations of the sold cas businesses and the gain on the sale  would have been million compared to net income of million in year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales increased in from million in to million in ride manufacturing  and smp contributed a total of million to net sales in subsequent to their respective acquisition dates 
the remainder of the increase reflects continued growth across ride snowboards and cas s brands as well as continued growth in the overall snowboarding market 
cas contributed approximately million to net sales in compared with million in subsequent to its august acquisition by the company 
gross profit increased in from million in to million in ride manufacturing  and smp contributed a total of million to gross profit in subsequent to their respective acquisition dates 
consolidated gross margins remained at for both and due to offsetting factors 
gross margins for were positively impacted by relatively higher gross margins contributed by ride manufacturing  and smp  offset by a full year of operations of cas  which has relatively lower margins 
gross margins for ride snowboards decreased slightly from in to in due primarily to the introduction of additional products at lower price points under the liquid brand during and higher international sales 
gross margins on sales to international distributors are lower than gross margins on sales to north american dealers 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in from million  or of net sales  in to million  or of net sales  in the dollar increase was due to the increased scope of ride snowboards and cas s operations in  the inclusion of cas s operations for the full period as well as the inclusion of the operations for ride manufacturing  and smp from their respective dates of acquisition 
the primary components of selling  general and administrative expenses were salaries  wages  commissions and other compensation million in and million in  advertising  promotion and team  in and million in and occupancy  depreciation and amortization  in and  in 
interest income  net of interest expense  increased from  in to  in the increase was due to overall higher cash balances on hand in stemming from the increased scope and profitability of the business  as well as capital supplied by the company s secondary stock offering in august and the exercise of outstanding warrants 
the provision for income taxes represents a effective tax rate for compared with a effective rate for the decrease is due primarily to a decrease in state income taxes attributable to cas moving its california operations to washington state where there are no state income taxes 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company s net income increased from million in to million in net income for included approximately million generated by ride manufacturing  and smp subsequent to their respective acquisition dates 
liquidity and capital resources the company requires capital for the development of its technology and products  procurement of raw materials and finished goods manufactured by others  and capital equipment 
the company financed its operations through cash and securities remaining from its secondary stock offering and from seasonal borrowings under its lines of credit 
the company financed its operations through its august secondary stock offering and the exercise of warrants issued in its may initial public offering 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million in compared with  in the increase in cash used in operations was attributable primarily to the non recurring restructuring charges  inventory write down and management transition expenses incurred in due to the seasonal nature of its business  the company s need for cash has been greater in its third and fourth quarters  when working capital has been invested in accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in compared to net cash used of million in net cash used in investing activities in included million in capital expenditures  offset by liquidation of securities and investments million and  in net cash received from the sale of the cas businesses 
cash used in investing activities in included approximately million expended in the company s acquisitions of ride manufacturing  and smp and million in capital expenditures 
principal capital expenditures in included snowboard and snowboard binding manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements  warehouse equipment  computers  office equipment and molds and tooling for snowboards and snowboard bindings 
the company expects to invest approximately million in capital expenditures during including additional manufacturing equipment to increase production capacity and efficiency and additional computers and business software 
the company intends to finance its capital expenditures from funds on hand  through leasing or from borrowings under its existing line of credit 
the company s capital resources include a million credit facility with a us bank 
this facility allows the company to take advances under a revolving line of credit and to establish import letters of credit for inventory purchases 
advances under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate or at a libor option 
at december   the company had outstanding letters of credit aggregating approximately million under this facility 
no cash advances were outstanding on the line as of december  the line of credit expires march  and has certain operating covenants  including financial ratios  working capital restrictions and restrictions on the payment of dividends on common stock 
the line is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the company is currently in the process of renewing this facility 
the company believes that cash on hand  collection of year end accounts receivable and seasonal borrowings under its line of credit  will be sufficient to meet its operating needs in certain of the company s purchase and sales commitments are denominated in foreign currencies 
because a change in the value of such currencies relative to the us dollar will affect the company s net sales  gross profit and net income  the company enters into forward currency contracts in order to hedge against adverse changes in the value of such currencies relative to the us dollar 
although the company believes that these contracts decrease the company s overall exposure to gains and losses from currency fluctuations  such exposure cannot be entirely eliminated 
during  international sales of certain of the company s snowboards were denominated in deutsche marks  which provided a natural hedge against dem denominated obligations 
although the company cannot accurately anticipate the effects of inflation  the company does not believe inflation has had or is likely to have a material effect on its results of operations or liquidity

the company s present policy is to retain earnings to finance the company s business 
any future dividends will be dependent upon the company s financial condition  results of operations  current and anticipated cash requirements  acquisition plans and plans for expansion  and any other factors which the company s board of directors deems relevant 
the company s bank loan agreement restricts the payment of dividends 
the company has no present intention of paying dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future
