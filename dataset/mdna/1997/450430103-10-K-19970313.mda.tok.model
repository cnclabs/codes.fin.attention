item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general since its inception in the company has acquired seven businesses 
due to the magnitude of these acquisitions and the integration of the acquired operations with the company s existing businesses  results of operations for prior periods are not necessarily comparable with or indicative of results of operations for current or future periods 
the company acquired amerex  inc and amerex industries  inc 
collectively  amerex and vic environmental systems  inc vic in may  each of which was accounted for as a purchase 
in december  the company acquired allied industries  inc allied in a transaction that was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
effective november   the company completed the ohmstede acquisition in a transaction that was accounted for as a purchase 
in  the company combined the allied and ohmstede operations to i permit ohmstede to efficiently manufacture large heat exchangers at allied s plant and thus enter a product class which ohmstede was not previously equipped to handle  ii encourage a unified cross selling effort to customers of both product lines  iii utilize allied s international distribution network to enhance ohmstede s international marketing efforts  and iv reduce combined operating costs 
the company records revenues from long term contracts using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  the company recognizes as revenues that portion of the total contract price which the cost of work completed to date bears to the estimated total cost of the work included in the contract 
because contracts may extend over more than one fiscal period  revisions of cost and profit estimates are made periodically and are reflected in the accounting period in which they are determined 
if the estimate of total costs on a contract indicates a loss  the total anticipated loss is recognized immediately 
contract costs include all direct material  labor and subcontracting costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as supplies  tools and repairs 
the company recognizes revenue from certain short term contracts using the completed contract method 
revenue is recognized when a project is substantially complete 
the contracts under this revenue recognition method are typically less than three months in duration 
beginning in  the company estimated percentage of completion for the materials portion of its long term contracts at allied based on when the material was placed into production  whereas previously such estimates were based on when the liability for the cost of the material was legally incurred 
the new method of applying the percentage of completion accounting method was adopted to better reflect the economics of allied s revenue and profit earnings process  and financial statements of prior years have been restated to apply the revised method retroactively 
the company historically has experienced quarterly fluctuations in its operating results 
operating results in any quarter are dependent upon the timing of equipment and system sales  which may vary considerably among quarters
