the key elements of the restructuring plan included the return of the company s emb and dash aircraft to the lessors  the sale of spare parts and tooling associated with those aircraft  and the closure of the company s flight operations in florida

total passengers increased year over year and length of haul remained unchanged 
management believes that industry fare increases in resulted in part from the expiration of the aviation trust fund tax  also known as the ticket tax  on december  the amount of the increases due to this factor cannot be determined  nor can the impact on revenue which resulted from the reinstatement of the tax on august  the ticket tax subsequently expired on december   and was reinstated for the period march   through september  operating expenses the company s operating expense increased in over reflecting increased asms and unit costs

the company must complete several training  operational  and administrative requirements before commencing crj service 
the company expects that it will be able to satisfy such requirements during the company has not previously operated jet aircraft but will operate these aircraft under the same faa regulatory requirements as it does with it s current fleet of aircraft

inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities sfas 
sfas provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers of financial assets using a financial components approach which focuses on control 
under this approach  following a transfer of financial assets  a company recognizes the financial assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred  derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished 
sfas is applicable to the company s borrowings under its line of credit collateralized by accounts receivable 
the company evaluated the financing transaction using the criteria set forth in sfas and concluded that it did not transfer control of its accounts receivable to the financial institution 
consequently  the company believes that adoption of sfas  as of january   will not have a material impact on its fiscal financial or operating results 
on march   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no   earnings per share sfas 
sfas provides a different method of calculating earnings per share than is currently used in accordance with apb opinion sfas provides for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share 
basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity  similar to existing fully diluted earnings per share 
using the principles set forth in sfas  basic earnings loss per share would have been   and for  and  respectively
