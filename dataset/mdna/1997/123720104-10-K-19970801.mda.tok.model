the united states district court dismissed the miami tribe s suit against the state of kansas  citing the united states supreme court s ruling in seminole v 
state of florida 
the supreme court ruled that the failure to negotiate provision of the igra did not allow an indian tribe to compel a state by litigation to negotiate a compact 
in february   former kansas governor finney requested a determination of the suitability of the miami indian land for indian gaming  under the igra  from the bureau of indian affairs the bia 
in may   the nigc again requested the same determination 
finally  in may   an associate solicitor within the bia issued an opinion letter stating that the miami tribe has not established jurisdiction over the miami land in kansas

is not indian land  pursuant to igra was affirmed
