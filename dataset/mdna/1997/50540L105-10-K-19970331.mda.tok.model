pursuant to service agreements  response provides management services that extend to all nonmedical aspects of the operations of the affiliated practices 
response is responsible for providing facilities  equipment  supplies  support personnel  and management and financial advisory services

in the event that net revenue is insufficient to pay all of the foregoing in full  then the base fee is first reduced  followed by the clinic expense portion of the management fee  and finally  physician retainage  therefore effectively shifting all operating risk to response 
in each service agreement utilizing the adjusted net revenue model  response is entitled to a performance fee generally equal to of annual surplus  defined as the excess of practice revenue over the sum of physician retainage  the clinic expense portion  and the base fee

each service agreement contains a liquidated damages provision binding the physician practice and the principals thereof in the event the service agreement is terminated for cause by response 
the liquidated damages are a declining amount  equal in the first year to the purchase price paid by response for practice assets and declining over a period of between and years 
principals are relieved of their individual obligations for liquidated damages only in the event of death  disability  or retirement at a predetermined age

trends the following is labone s analysis of certain existing trends that have been identified as potentially affecting the future financial results of labone 
due to the potential for a rapid rate of change in any number of factors associated with the insurance and healthcare laboratory testing industries  it is difficult to quantify with any degree of certainty labone s future volumes  sales or net earnings 
in the last several years there has been a decline in the number of life insurance applications written in the industry 
in addition  the insurance laboratory testing industry continues to be highly competitive 
the primary focus of the competition has been on pricing 
labone continues to maintain its market leadership by providing quality products and services at competitive prices 
management expects that prices will continue to decline during due to competitive pressures 
this trend may have a continuing material impact on earnings from operations 
during june  the fda approved an oral fluid western blot test as a confirmation for the oral fluid hiv antibody test 
this allows for the initial screen and the western blot confirmation test to be performed on the same specimen 
due to the lower collection expense associated with oral fluid collection devices  the potential exists for an expansion of the testing market 
currently  there are approximately million individual life insurance policies sold in the united states annually 
however  laboratory services are provided on only approximately million of these policy applicants 
the non invasive nature of oral specimen collection allows for low cost collection  making testing much more affordable on smaller face value insurance policies 
conversely  the device also has the potential to cannibalize part of the existing blood and urine testing market 
the net impact of oral fluid testing cannot be determined at this time 
during  the fda approved two home based collection kits for hiv testing 
these products allow individuals to confidentially determine their hiv status prior to applying for insurance 
to avoid insuring these high risk applicants  the insurance companies may elect to lower the threshold at which laboratory tests are requested to prevent writing policies on hiv positive applicants 
most insurance laboratory testing is performed on policies of  or greater  representing about one third of all policy applicants 
the  to  range represents approximately one quarter of current insurance policy applicants 
the potential exists for a significant expansion of laboratory testing for lower policy amounts 
several clients have indicated that they plan to test a higher percentage of their applicants in because of these new hiv testing products 
the net impact of these potential changes cannot be determined at this time
