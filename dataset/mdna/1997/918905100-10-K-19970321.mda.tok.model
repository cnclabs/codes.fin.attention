kronos tio operating income declined in primarily due to lower average selling prices  partially offset by higher sales volume 
in billing currency terms  average tio selling prices in were lower than tio selling prices began declining in the last half of  and selling prices at the end of were lower than at the end of and below the average for while tio prices declined in  industry wide demand for tio has grown  as kronos tio sales volume increased in to a record  metric tons  with improved sales volumes worldwide 
sales volumes in the second half of were higher than the same period in in response to softening demand in the first half of and its high inventory levels at the end of  kronos curtailed production rates in early as demand increased during the last half of and inventories returned to more normal levels  kronos production rates were increased to near full capacity in late and the average capacity utilization was for the year 
kronos production rates were of its capacity in and at full capacity in approximately one half of kronos tio sales  by volume  were attributable to markets in europe  with attributable to north america and the balance to export markets 
the improvement in kronos tio results was primarily due to higher average selling prices and production volume  partially offset by lower sales volume 
in billing currency terms  average tio selling prices in were approximately higher than tio sales volume in was lower than the record levels of  with declines in both europe and north america  due to softening demand in the second half of and customers building inventories during and early demand  supply and pricing within the tio industry is cyclical  and changes in industry economic conditions can significantly impact nl s earnings and operating cash flows 
the average tio selling price index using of in was lower than the index of was above the level 
in comparison  the index was below the price index of and higher than the price index of many factors influence tio pricing levels  including industry capacity  worldwide demand growth and customer inventory levels and purchasing decisions 
nl believes that the tio industry has long term growth potential  as a result of certain barriers to entry which inhibit industry capacity growth 
the decline in tio prices in  nl believes  was due in part to the impact of recent debottlenecking projects increasing capacity  tio customers de stocking inventories in a period of declining prices  and greater competition for sales volume with more industry capacity available 
nl expects its tio operating margins will begin to improve during the second quarter of as the impact of recently announced price increases takes effect 
however  nl expects its tio operating income to be below that of  primarily because of anticipated lower average selling prices for tio and lower technology fee income 
while nl expects tio prices will begin to increase during  the average for is expected to be lower than the average price 
nl expects demand for tio to remain strong in  and the continued growth in demand should result in significant improvement in average selling prices for tio over the longer run 
rheox s operating results include a million gain related to the reduction of certain us employee pension benefits 
rheox s operating results improved in compared to primarily as a result of higher sales volume and higher average selling prices 
nl has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states principally germany  belgium  norway  the united kingdom and canada 
the us dollar value of nl s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or adversely impact reported earnings and affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
a significant amount of nl s sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in  principally major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
certain raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are denominated primarily in the local currencies 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies decreased sales by million compared to and increased sales by million compared to component products years ended december  change in millions net sales operating income operating income margin sales increased in both and compared to the respective prior year due primarily to higher volumes in the office workstation component and drawer slide lines 
drawer slide sales increased in compared to and workstation component products were up 
both office workstation components and drawer slide lines reported new highs in sales in each of the past three years 
lock volumes from a government contract completed in early have only been partially replaced  and consequently lock sales declined about in compared to the company signed a new  contract with the same government agency in december  with shipments scheduled to be delivered in the first nine months of operating income margins in were impacted by higher raw material costs  as competitive pressures prevented full recovery through higher selling prices  as well as costs associated with integrating the operations of a canadian competitor acquired in august the new three year collective bargaining agreement effective february covering compx s canadian employees provides for  among other things  wage rate increases of to per year 
about of the company s component products sales are generated by its canadian operations 
about two thirds of these canadian produced sales are denominated in us dollars while substantially all of the related costs are incurred in canadian dollars 
consequently  relative changes in the us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate impact operating results 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar favorably impacted operating results in compared with and unfavorably impacted operating results compared with fast food years ended december  change in millions net sales operating income operating income margin arby s units operated at end of year average during the year comparable store sales increased in compared to operating income and margins improved due to successful marketing promotions  reduced training and recruiting costs associated with the slower rate of opening new stores in and closure of certain under performing units 
excluding the effect of a rd week in  comparable store sales were relatively flat in compared to  and margins in were adversely impacted by higher labor costs and discounts associated with competitive promotions 
a significant portion of sybra s restaurant employees work on a part time basis and are paid at rates related to the minimum wage rate 
restaurant labor costs currently approximate of sales 
the two step  cent increase in the minimum wage rate which became effective october  increased sybra s labor costs 
sybra concurrently implemented certain price increases to offset the impact of the first step of the october  wage rate increase 
any further increase in the minimum wage rate or legislation requiring mandatory medical insurance benefits to part time employees would further increase sybra s labor costs 
although sybra s competitors would likely experience similar increases  there can be no assurance that further increases in sales prices can be implemented to offset future increases in these costs 
sybra opened new stores during the past three years one in 
sybra continually evaluates the profitability of its individual restaurants  closed stores during the past three years in and intends to continue to close unprofitable stores when appropriate 
costs associated with store closings were million in  
million in and million in sybra currently expects a net increase of about three stores in as it plans to open six new stores and close at least three underperforming units

there can be no assurance that any such transactions will be completed 
waste management waste control specialists llc  formed in november  was constructing its west texas facility during and waste control specialists reported a loss of 
million during the last two months of and a million loss in during its development stage 
the company received its first wastes for disposal in february valhi is entitled to a cumulative preferential return on its million investment in waste control specialists after which earnings are generally split the liabilities assumed by waste control specialists exceeded the carrying value of the assets contributed by the other owner by approximately million 
accordingly  all of waste control specialists income or loss will accrue to valhi until waste control specialists reports positive equity attributable to the other owner 
general corporate and other items general corporate 
net general corporate expenses in were lower than in due primarily to lower provisions for environmental remediation costs as well as the effect of a million litigation settlement gain and a million gain on disposition of a surplus grain facility in net general corporate expenses in declined compared to the pro forma amount as lower environmental remediation and litigation costs at nl in more than offset nl s million litigation settlement gain 
general corporate expenses in are expected to be significantly higher than in due principally to the million pre tax charge from adoption of the new standard regarding accounting for environmental remediation liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
securities earnings in were reduced by a first quarter decline in the market value of certain fixed income investments  while average balances available for investment were lower in compared with securities earnings is expected to increase significantly in due principally to the impact of i distributions to be received from the amalgamated sugar company llc  which will be reported as dividend income  and ii interest earned on valhi s loans to snake river sugar company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
interest expense declined in due primarily to lower average variable interest rates  principally nl s dm denominated debt  partially offset by higher average levels of such debt 
interest expense in approximated the pro forma amount as lower borrowing levels associated with nl s dm and other bank loans and lower average interest rates on nl s dm denominated debt were offset by changes in currency exchange rates and higher average us variable borrowing rates 
interest expense is expected to increase significantly in due to  among other things  valhi s million in loans from snake river sugar company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   approximately million of consolidated indebtedness  principally publicly traded debt  bears interest at fixed interest rates averaging 
the weighted average interest rate on million of outstanding variable rate borrowings at december  was  down from on outstanding variable rate borrowings at december  and at december  these declines in average interest rates are due in large part to lower rates on nl s dm denominated borrowings 
nl has significant dm denominated variable interest rate borrowings and  accordingly  nl s interest expense is also subject to currency fluctuations 
periodic cash interest payments are not required on valhi s deferred coupon lyons  and nl s discount notes do not require periodic interest payments until as a result  current cash interest expense payments are lower than accrual basis interest expense 
minority interest 
minority interest in earnings in consists principally of nl dividends paid to stockholders other than valhi 
based on the continuing decline in tio selling prices and the current tio industry pricing outlook  nl s board of directors suspended its quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of because nl did not pay any dividends in  all of nl s net income in accrued to valhi for financial reporting purposes 
minority interest in earnings in and pro forma relates to certain partially owned foreign subsidiaries of nl  certain of which minority interest was purchased by rheox in early at december   nl separately reported a shareholders deficit of approximately million and  as a result  no minority interest in nl industries is recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
until such time as nl reports positive shareholders equity in its separate financial statements  all of nl s undistributed earnings will accrue to the company for financial reporting purposes 
provision for income taxes the principal reasons for the difference between the company s effective income tax rates and the us federal statutory income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax rates vary by jurisdiction country and or state  and relative changes in the geographic mix of the company s pre tax earnings can result in fluctuations in the company s consolidated effective income tax rate 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the amalgamated sugar company s results of operations are presented on the equity method during  and amalgamated is a member of the consolidated us tax group of which valhi and contran are members  and consequently the company did not provide any incremental income taxes related to such earnings 
certain subsidiaries  including nl  are not members of the consolidated us tax group  and the company does provide incremental income taxes on such earnings 
both of these factors impact the company s overall effective tax rate 
the provision for income taxes in includes net deferred income tax benefits resulting from changes in the us canada income tax treaty and the reduction of nl s deferred income tax valuation allowance to recognize the future benefit of certain tax credits 
in both and  the geographic mix of pre tax income included losses in certain of nl s tax jurisdictions for which no current refund was available and for which recognition of a deferred tax asset was not considered appropriate 
all of these factors also impacted the company s overall effective tax rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
equity in earnings of amalgamated as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the amalgamated sugar company s results of operations are presented on the equity method during  and amalgamated s sales  operating income and net earnings for each of the past three years are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
beginning in  the company will report distributions received from the amalgamated sugar company llc as dividend income 
average sugar selling prices in were higher than in reflecting a smaller crop size  refined sugar sales volume in million cwt decreased from the record levels of an increased extraction rate in  in part due to the implementation of certain recently completed productivity improvement capital projects  along with a higher sugar content of the beets have resulted in a lower beet cost per hundredweight cwt of sugar produced  lower aggregate sugar processing costs and improved fifo based earnings in compared to refined sugar sales volume in million cwt was an all time record 
due primarily to an abnormally high yield per acre  amalgamated s sugar production from the crop harvested in the fall of was approximately higher than its previous record crop 
the record volume was aided by expiration of the us government imposed restrictive marketing allotments at the end of the third quarter of  and fourth quarter volume was almost higher than the same period in when marketing allotments were in effect 
average refined sugar selling prices in increased slightly compared to and were aided in part by the effect of marketing allotments imposed on domestic producers during the crop year ended september  to help reduce the relatively high level of sugar inventories resulting from the record crop  amalgamated made limited sales into foreign markets during the first nine months of  which sales were excluded from the domestic allotments 
net returns from foreign sales are typically lower than from domestic sales 
the large sugarbeet crop harvested in the fall of and adverse weather conditions resulted in a long and difficult processing campaign 
these factors  along with a lower sugar content of the beets  contributed to a increase in per hundredweight cwt crop processing costs 
sugarbeet purchase cost is the largest cost component of producing refined sugar and the price paid for sugarbeets is  under the terms of contracts with the sugarbeet growers  a function of the average selling price of amalgamated s refined sugar 
as a result  changes in sugar selling prices impact sugarbeet purchase costs as well as revenues and serve as a partial hedge against changing prices 
however  the impact of related lifo inventory adjustments can significantly affect operating income and margin comparisons relative to fifo basis comparisons 
equity in earnings of nl prior to consolidation as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company s interest in nl was reported by the equity method during as discussed above and in note  the company consolidated nl s results of operations beginning in the company s equity in nl s separately reported results of operations for  summarized below  differs from its effective percentage interest in nl s separate results 
amortization of basis differences arising from purchase accounting adjustments made by the company in conjunction with the acquisition of its interests in nl generally reduces earnings  or increases losses  as reported by the company compared to amounts separately reported by nl

loss from continuing operations the company s equity in nl s losses  including amortization of basis differences discontinued operations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated cash flows general 
the consolidation of nl s cash flows beginning in significantly impacts cash flow comparisons with operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities was million in  million in and million in changes in assets and liabilities result primarily from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
under the terms of internal revenue code and similar state regulations regarding the timing of estimated tax payments  the company is not required to pay income taxes approximately million related to medite s asset sales of its timber and timberlands and irish mdf subsidiary to such tax authorities until at that time  the payment of such cash income taxes will be shown as a reduction in cash flows from operating activities even though the pre tax proceeds from disposition of such assets are shown as part of cash flow from investing activities 
cash flow from operating activities comparisons are also impacted by relatives changes in the company s portfolio of marketable trading securities 
changes in such portfolio generated approximately million of cash in and million in noncash interest expense consists of amortization of original issue discount on certain valhi and nl indebtedness and amortization of deferred financing costs 
investing activities 
capital expenditures are disclosed by business segment in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the estimated cost to complete capital projects in process approximated million  most of which relates to environmental protection and compliance programs and productivity enhancing equipment at nl

net borrowings in include i dm million million when borrowed under nl s dm credit facility used primarily to both fund nl s operations and fund the german income tax settlement payments discussed below and ii million under valhi short term credit facilities 
repayments of indebtedness include scheduled principal payments on nl term loans 
net repayments of indebtedness in relate primarily to i million of net short term borrowings under nl dm denominated short term credit lines and ii principal repayments under nl term loans  including a million prepayment under rheox s term loan 
after giving effects to the amendments to the dm credit facility and the rheox term loan discussed below  unused lines of credit available for borrowing under revolving credit facilities at december   including the dm facility  approximated million 
chemicals nl industries demand  supply and pricing within the tio industry is cyclical  and changes in industry economic conditions can significantly impact nl s earnings and operating cash flows 
during  declining tio prices unfavorably impacted nl s operating income and cash flows from operations comparisons with nl generated million in cash flows from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities in compared to million in and million in relative changes in nl s inventories  receivables and payables excluding the effect of foreign currency translation  including relative changes in nl s portfolio of marketable trading securities  used million of net cash in  compared to a million use of net cash in average tio selling prices began a downward trend in the last half of  which trend continued throughout nl expects tio prices will begin to increase during  although nl s average tio selling price in is expected to be lower than the average 
however  no assurance can be given that price trends will conform to nl s expectations and future cash flows will be adversely affected should price trends be lower than nl s expectations 
in order to improve its near term liquidity  nl refinanced rheox s term loan in january  generating approximately million cash  and used the net cash proceeds  along with other available funds  to prepay a portion of the dm credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  nl and its lenders modified certain financial covenants of the dm credit facility  and nl has guaranteed the facility 
as a result of the refinancing and prepayment  nl s aggregate scheduled debt payments for and decreased by million million in and million in 
based upon nl s expectations for the tio industry and anticipated demands on nl s cash resources as discussed herein  nl expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its near term obligations including operations  capital expenditures and debt service 
to the extent that actual developments differ from nl s expectations  nl s liquidity could be adversely affected 
nl s capital expenditures during the past three years aggregated million  including million million in for nl s ongoing environmental protection and compliance programs  including a canadian waste acid neutralization facility  a norwegian onshore tailings disposal system and various off gas desulfurization systems 
nl s estimated capital expenditures are million and include million in the area of environmental protection and compliance  primarily related to the off gas desulfurization and water treatment chemical purification systems 
nl spent million in and million in  and plans to spend an additional million in  in capital expenditures related to a debottlenecking project at its leverkusen  germany chloride process tio facility that is expected to increase nl s worldwide annual attainable tio production capacity to about  metric tons in the capital expenditures of the tio manufacturing joint venture are not included in nl s capital expenditures 
nl and its subsidiaries held million of cash and cash equivalents held by non us subsidiaries at december   of which million is restricted 
at december   after giving effect for the refinancing discussed above  nl had cash and cash equivalents of million and had million and million available for borrowing under existing us and non us credit facilities  respectively 
the terms of intercompany notes from kii payable to nl mirror the terms of nl s publicly traded debt and are designed to facilitate the flow of funds from nl s subsidiaries to service such indebtedness 
at december   nl had complied with  or had obtained a waiver for  all financial covenants governing its debt agreements 
certain of nl s us and us income tax returns  including germany  are being examined and tax authorities have or may propose tax deficiencies 
nl has reached an agreement with the german tax authorities regarding examinations which resolve certain significant tax contingencies for years through nl received certain final assessments and paid approximately dm million million when paid  including interest  in in final settlement of the agreed issues 
certain other german tax contingencies remain outstanding and will continue to be litigated 
although nl believes that it will ultimately prevail in the litigation  nl has granted a dm million million at december  lien on its nordenham  germany tio plant in favor of the german tax authorities until the litigation is resolved 
no assurance can be given that this litigation will be resolved in nl s favor in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court rulings 
nl believes that it has adequately provided accruals for additional income taxes and related interest expense which may ultimately result from all such examinations and believes that the ultimate disposition of such examinations should not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
at december   nl had recorded net deferred tax liabilities of million 
nl  which is not a member of the contran tax group  operates in numerous tax jurisdictions  in certain of which it has temporary differences that net to deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 
nl has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance of million at december   principally related to the us and germany  offsetting deferred tax assets which nl believes do not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in addition to the chemicals businesses conducted through kronos and rheox  nl also has certain interests and associated liabilities relating to certain discontinued or divested businesses 
nl has been named as a defendant  prp  or both  in a number of legal proceedings associated with environmental matters  including waste disposal sites  mining locations and facilities currently or previously owned  operated or used by nl  certain of which are on the us epa s superfund national priorities list or similar state lists 
on a quarterly basis  nl evaluates the potential range of its liability at sites where it has been named as a prp or defendant 
nl believes it has provided adequate accruals million at december  for reasonably estimable costs of such matters  but nl s ultimate liability may be affected by a number of factors  including changes in remedial alternatives and costs and the allocation of such costs among prps 
nl is also a defendant in a number of legal proceedings seeking damages for personal injury and property damage arising out of the sale of lead pigments and lead based paints 
nl has not accrued any amounts for the pending lead pigment and lead based paint litigation 
there is no assurance that nl will not incur future liability in respect of this pending litigation in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court and jury rulings in pending and possible future cases 
however  based on  among other things  the results of such litigation to date  nl believes that the pending lead pigment and lead based paint litigation is without merit 
liability that may result  if any  cannot reasonably be estimated 
nl currently believes the disposition of all claims and disputes  individually or in the aggregate  should not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
there can be no assurance that additional matters of these types will not arise in the future 
see item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in results of operations chemicals  nl has substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of nl s assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore nl s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
the carrying value of nl s net investment in its german operations is a net liability due principally to its dm bank credit facility  while its net investment in its other non us operations are net assets 
nl periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its debt service and capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  nl has in the past and may in the future seek to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  issue additional securities  modify its dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of its business  nl may review opportunities for the acquisition  divestiture  joint venture or other business combinations in the chemicals industry 
in the event of any future acquisition  nl may consider using its available cash  issuing its equity securities or increasing its indebtedness to the extent permitted by the agreements governing nl s existing debt 
in this regard  the indentures governing nl s publicly traded debt contain provisions which limit the ability of nl and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or hold noncontrolling interests in business units

condensed cash flow data for medite and amalgamated is presented in notes and  respectively  to the consolidated financial statements 
medite has made certain representations and warranties to the purchasers of its timber and timberlands  irish mdf subsidiary and oregon mdf facility concerning  among other things  the assets sold 
such representations are customary in transactions of these types 
medite has agreed to indemnify the three purchasers for up to an aggregate of million for certain breaches of these representations and warranties 
as part of the transactions  valhi has agreed to guarantee medite s indemnification obligations 
the company does not currently expect to be required to perform under any of these indemnification obligations 
general corporate valhi and valcor valhi s operations are conducted principally through subsidiaries and affiliates nl industries  valcor and waste control specialists 
valcor is an intermediate parent company with operations conducted through its subsidiaries compx international and sybra 
accordingly  valhi s and valcor s long term ability to meet their respective corporate obligations are dependent in large measure on the receipt of dividends or other distributions from their respective subsidiaries 
nl  which paid dividends in the first three quarters of  suspended its dividend in the fourth quarter 
suspension of nl s dividend is not currently expected to materially adversely impact valhi s financial position or liquidity 
various credit agreements to which subsidiaries are parties contain customary limitations on the payment of dividends  typically a percentage of net income or cash flow  however  such restrictions have not significantly impacted the company s ability to service parent company level obligations 
neither valhi nor valcor has guaranteed any indebtedness of their respective subsidiaries 
valhi s lyons do not require current cash debt service 
valhi owns million shares of dresser common stock  which shares are held in escrow for the benefit of holders of the lyons 
the lyons are exchangeable at any time  at the option of the holder  for the dresser shares owned by valhi 
exchanges of lyons for dresser stock would result in the company reporting income related to the disposition of the dresser stock for both financial reporting and income tax purposes  although no cash proceeds would be generated by such exchanges 
cash income taxes that would have been triggered at december  by exchanges of all of the outstanding lyons for dresser stock at such date were approximately million 
valhi continues to receive regular quarterly dresser dividends presently 
per quarter on the escrowed shares 
in addition  the company is required  at the option of the holder  to purchase the lyons in october at the accreted value of approximately per  principal amount at maturity approximately million in october 
such redemption price may be paid  at the option of valhi  in cash  dresser common stock  or a combination thereof 
at december   the lyons had an accreted value equivalent to approximately per dresser share  and the market price of the dresser common stock was per share 
as long as the value of the underlying dresser shares exceeds the accreted value of the lyons  the company does not expect a significant number of lyons holder to seek redemption 
because the lyons are redeemable at the option of the lyon holder in october  the lyons are classified as a current liability and the dresser shares are classified as a current asset at december  during and  valhi purchased an additional million and million  respectively  of nl common stock 
in january  valhi made its final million contribution to waste control specialists  following million contributed in and million in in february  the company entered into a million revolving credit facility with waste control specialists

at december   valcor had cash  cash equivalents and demand loans to subsidiaries of approximately million  a portion of which will be used to pay cash income taxes in related to medite s asset disposals as discussed above 
also under the terms of the indenture  valcor is required to tender for a portion of the valcor notes  at par  to the extent that a specified amount of these proceeds is not used to either permanently paydown senior indebtedness of valcor or its subsidiaries or invest in related businesses  both as defined in the indenture  within one year of disposition 
while valcor is not yet required to execute a tender offer related to medite s asset dispositions  on march   valcor announced it had initiated a tender offer whereby valcor would purchase up to million principal amount of valcor notes on a pro rata basis  at par value  in satisfaction of the covenant contained in the indenture 
pursuant to its terms  the tender offer will expire on april   unless extended by valcor 
the amount of valcor notes which will ultimately be purchased by valcor pursuant to the tender offer is dependent upon the amount of valcor notes properly tendered 
consequently  there can be no assurance as to the amount of valcor notes which will ultimately be purchased by valcor 
the net proceeds from any disposition of the company s fast food operations  net of repayments of sybra s bank indebtedness  would similarly be available for valcor s general corporate purposes 
if the disposition of the company s fast food operations is completed and none of those net proceeds are used as provided in the indenture  a portion of the notes would be subject to a subsequent tender offer

the redemption purchase price is generally million plus the amount of any deferrals of cash distributions from the llc
