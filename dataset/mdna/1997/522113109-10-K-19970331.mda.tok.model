item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition lease accounting since  the company has principally engaged in two types of lease transactions which  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases  are classified as operating leases or direct finance leases 
the allocation of income among accounting periods within a lease term will vary depending upon the lease classification  as described below 
direct finance leases 
direct finance leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the lessee 
a lease is a direct finance lease if the collectibility of lease payments is reasonably certain and it meets one of the following criteria the lease transfers ownership of the equipment to the lessee by the end of the lease term  the lease contains a bargain purchase option  the lease term at inception is at least of the estimated economic life of the leased equipment  or the present value of the minimum lease payments is at least of the fair value of the leased equipment at inception of the lease 
direct finance leases are recorded as investment in direct finance leases upon acceptance of the equipment by the customer 
at the inception of the lease  unearned lease income represents the amount by which the gross lease payments receivable plus estimated residual value exceeds the equipment cost 
unearned lease income is recognized  using the interest method  as earned lease income over the lease term 
operating leases 
all lease contracts which do not meet the criteria of direct finance leases are accounted for as operating leases 
monthly lease payments are recorded as operating lease revenues 
leased equipment is recorded  at the company s cost  as investment in operating leases and depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term to the estimated residual value at the expiration of the lease term 
the residual value of an item of leased equipment is its fair market value at the expiration of the lease 
residual values are estimated at the inception of the lease and reviewed quarterly over the term of the lease 
estimated residual values of leased equipment may be adjusted downward  if necessary 
decreases in estimated residual values are made as the change in residual value becomes apparent  and are reflected over the remaining term of the lease by increased depreciation expense for operating leases or by decreased earned lease income for direct finance leases 
when equipment is sold  the net proceeds realized in excess of the estimated residual value are generally recorded as a operating lease revenue  or the amount by which the estimated residual value exceeds the net proceeds is recorded as a loss 
see business leasing and sales activities remarketing 
when equipment is re leased  the company continues to depreciate the equipment in accordance with the company s then current estimate of its residual value  and the monthly lease payments are recorded as revenue when billed 
substantially all of the leases which the company enters into are noncancelable transactions under which the obligor must make all scheduled payments  maintain the equipment  accept the risk of loss of such equipment and pay all equipment related taxes

results of operations for the three years ended december  revenues 
revenues increased  or  from  in to  in  and  or  to  in operating lease revenue increased  or  from  in to  in  and  or  to  in the increase in operating lease revenue for both periods reflects a higher average investment in operating leases  resulting from increases in operating leases originated or acquired by the company over the three year period 
earned lease income decreased  or  from  in to  in  and  or  to  in  as a result of outstanding direct finance leases being paid down and fewer new direct finance leases being originated  due principally to the company s focus on operating leases 
depreciation operating leases 
depreciation increased  or  from  in to  in  and  or  to  in the increase in depreciation for both years is principally the result of an increase in the operating lease base  resulting from increases in operating leases originated or acquired by the company over the three year period 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  from  in to  in  and  or  to  in the increase  for both years  is due to increased personnel costs and compensation associated with the overall growth in leasing activities  particularly increases in personnel in the company s lease contract administration and information systems to support such growth  and an increase in discretionary year end bonuses from the prior year 
in addition  a substantial increase in personnel in  resulting from the company s expansion to europe  was a significant contributor to the increase in sg a expenses in the sg a expenses were also significantly affected by increases in travel costs associated with increased leasing activity and the commencement of the company s operations in europe  and increased occupancy costs resulting from an expansion of the company s headquarters and the commencement of the company s operations in the united kingdom 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  or  from  in to  in  and  or  to  in the increase in interest expense in was due to higher average recourse and nonrecourse debt outstanding  related to the higher average investment in leases  and an increase in the company s weighted average interest rate 
the increased rates in resulted principally from the issuance of million of nonrecourse subordinated debt to finance a portion of the company s then existing equity investments in leases  thus providing cash for future equity investments in leases 
the increase in was due to higher recourse and nonrecourse debt outstanding  related to the higher average investment in leases 
income taxes 
provisions for income taxes were  and of income before income taxes for the years  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rates from to relates primarily to changes in the geographic distribution of the company s income to states with higher tax rates 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  net income and net income per share increased in each of the years ended december   and net income increased  or  from  in to  in  and  or  to  in liquidity and capital resources the company generated cash flow from operations of  during  compared to net income of  for the same period 
cash flow from operations was higher than net income primarily as a result of non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  of  offset by uses of cash in operations  including resulting changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable  deferred income taxes  and other assets and liabilities  totaling  investing activities  which are primarily related to investments in equipment for lease  used  during the period 
financing activities generated  from  in new borrowings of recourse and nonrecourse debt and  from the company s issuance of common stock in its public offering in february  and upon exercise of options  aggregating  offset by repayment of capital lease obligations and recourse and nonrecourse borrowings  aggregating  additionally  the impact of exchange rate changes on cash was  the net result of the above activity for was a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  the financing necessary to support the company s leasing activities has principally been provided from nonrecourse and recourse borrowings 
historically  the company has obtained recourse and nonrecourse borrowings from money center banks  regional banks  insurance companies  finance companies and financial intermediaries 
in  the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  leasing solutions receivables  inc  obtained long term financing for its leasing activity through the issuance of secured  nonrecourse debt securities 
additionally  in january  the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  leasing solutions receivables ii  inc  obtained long term financing for its leasing activities through a commercial paper backed conduit  revolving  nonrecourse line of credit provided by an affiliate of a money center bank 
borrowings under this facility of approximately  as of january   bear interest at a rate of 
these borrowings securitizations are secured by lease receivables and the underlying equipment financed under such arrangements 
in february   the company closed a public stock offering in which it sold  shares of the company s common stock 
the company received net proceeds of approximately  from the offering 
in october  the company closed a public debt offering for  of convertible subordinated notes 
the notes constitute general unsecured obligations of the company and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future debt of the company 
the company received net proceeds of approximately  from the offering 
the seven year notes bear interest at a rate of per annum and are convertible into the company s common stock at a conversion price of 
interest is payable in april and october of each year 
principal is payable upon maturity in october the company may call  or prepay  all or a portion of the notes beginning in october these equity and debt public offerings were made principally to raise equity for the company s purchase of equipment for lease to its customers 
prior to the permanent financing of its leases  interim financing has been obtained through short term  secured  recourse facilities 
the company s available credit under these short term  recourse facilities totalled  at december  a brief description of each of those facilities follows 
 revolving facility syndicated with ten banks  expiring september  at december    with a weighted average interest rate of per annum  was outstanding under this facility 
borrowings under the facility bear an interest rate  at the company s option  of the agent bank s prime rate or libor plus basis points 
 revolving facility with one bank  with borrowings available through april   and repayments due days after borrowing 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at libor plus basis points 
the company also has a  revolving facility  expiring october   with one bank 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
the proceeds of borrowings under this line are used exclusively to fund certain accounts payable to one of the company s vendors resulting from the purchase of equipment for lease to one significant customer of the company 
the company presently expects to enter into a  revolving facility with another bank in the reasonably near future 
borrowings under this facility are expected to bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus basis points and the facility is expected to have a one year term 
in addition to interim financing of lease transactions  proceeds borrowed under this facility are expected to be available for general corporate purposes 
the company allowed the two facilities described above to expire 
it did so because it did not  at the time  need the availability provided by the facilities  given the increase in availability under its syndicated line described above in september and the almost  in net proceeds received from its convertible debt offering described above 
in march  the company entered into a  nonrecourse revolving facility with an affiliate of a money center bank 
although this facility expired in march  the company expects to renew it in the reasonably near future for an additional one year period 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate of basis points over average life treasuries at the time of borrowing 
to date  the company has refinanced approximately  of borrowings under its other short term facilities through this facility 
at december    was outstanding under this facility and the weighted average interest rate on that amount was 
the company expects to refinance  from time to time  under this facility  additional borrowings under its other short term facilities in order to fix the interest rate for these borrowings 
borrowings under the above described facilities are generally secured by lease receivables and the underlying equipment financed under the facility 
payments under the company s borrowings and the maturities of its long term borrowings are typically structured to match the payments due under the leases securing the borrowings 
the agreements for the facilities contain covenants regarding leverage a recourse liabilities to equity ratio of not more than to  interest coverage  minimum net worth and profitability and a limitation on the payment of dividends 
at december   the company had a recourse liabilities to equity ratio of to if the company finances  on a long term  nonrecourse basis  the equipment and related leases presently financed under short term  recourse facilities  its recourse liabilities to equity ratio will decrease to below to occasionally  the company will obtain long term  nonrecourse financing for individual significant lease transactions at the time or shortly after it purchases the related equipment 
the company borrowed an aggregate of  under such arrangements in an aggregate of   of which is recourse  with a weighted average interest rate of per annum  remained outstanding under all such arrangements as of december the company s debt financing activities typically provide approximately to of the purchase price of the equipment purchased by the company for lease to its customers 
the to balance of the purchase price the company s equity investment in equipment must generally be financed by cash flow from its operations  the proceeds of subordinated debt  or its equivalent  or recourse debt  or common stock or convertible debt sold by the company 
debt financing for the company s equity investment is not readily available in the marketplace and may require an interest rate materially higher than is required by the company s conventional debt financing 
although the company expects that the credit quality of its lessees and its residual return history will continue to allow it to obtain such financing  no assurances can be given that such financing will be available  at acceptable terms or at all 
the arrangements under which the company expects to finance its leasing activities in europe are likely to be substantially similar to the lease financing arrangements utilized by the company in the united states 
the company s european subsidiaries will engage in nonrecourse and recourse borrowings  with terms comparable to its domestic borrowings  to provide most of the purchase price of equipment and finance its equity investment in equipment from one or more of the equity sources described above 
the company has not yet secured lines of credit to support its european leasing activities 
however  although no assurances can be given  it expects that one or more of such lines  to be provided by both united states financial institutions currently lending to the company and by european financial institutions  will be put in place prior to the end of the second quarter of the company s current lines of credit  if renewed or replaced  the renewal of recently expired lines  its expected access to the public and private securities markets  both debt and equity  anticipated new lines of credit both short term and long term and recourse and nonrecourse  anticipated long term financing of individual significant lease transactions  and its estimated cash flow from operations are anticipated to provide adequate capital to fund the company s operations  including acquisitions and financings under its vendor programs  for the next twelve months 
although no assurances can be given  the company expects to be able to renew or timely replace its existing and recently expired lines of credit  to continue to have access to the public and private securities markets  both debt and equity  and to be able to enter into new lines of credit and individual financing transactions 
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company s future quarterly operating results and the market price of its stock may fluctuate 
in the event the company s revenues or earnings for any quarter are less than the level expected by securities analysts or the market in general  such shortfall could have an immediate and significant adverse impact on the market price of the company s stock 
any such adverse impact could be greater if any such shortfall occurs near the time of any material decrease in any widely followed stock index or in the market price of the stock of one or more public equipment leasing companies or major customers or vendors of the company 
the company s quarterly results of operations are susceptible to fluctuations for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  as a result of sales by the company of equipment it has leased to its customers or of sales of the lease receivables under the leases with its customers 
such sales of equipment or lease receivables  which are an ordinary but not predictable part of the company s business  will have the effect of increasing revenues  and  to the extent sales proceeds exceed net book value  net income  during the quarter in which the sale occurs 
furthermore  any such sale may result in the reduction of revenue  and net income  otherwise expected in subsequent quarters  as the company will not receive lease revenue from the sold equipment in those quarters 
given the possibility of such fluctuations  the company believes that comparisons of the results of its operations to immediately succeeding quarters are not necessarily meaningful and that such results for one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance
