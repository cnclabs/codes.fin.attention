item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  appearing on pages through  and note information by industry segment of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing on pages through competition corning competes across all of its product lines with many large and varied manufacturers  both domestic and foreign 
competition within the communications segment s primary products is intense among several significant companies 
corning represents an important market presence in the segment s principal product lines 
price and new product innovations are significant competitive factors 
within the specialty materials segment  corning s principal products face competition from a variety of material manufacturers  some of which manufacture similar products made from materials other than glass and ceramics 
among other things  innovation  product quality  performance  and service are key competitive elements 
competition is also intense in the consumer products business 
corning competes in a broad range of products and markets with equally diverse competitors 
primary competitive influences include price  function  design  customer service  and the overall retail economies in which corning s products compete 
in certain consumer product lines  corning has a sizeable market presence 
corning strives to maintain its market position through technology and product innovation 
for the future  corning s competitive advantage lies in its commitment to research and development  its financial resources  and its commitment to quality 
raw materials corning s production of specialty glasses and related materials requires significant quantities of energy and batch materials 
although energy shortages have not been a problem recently  corning has achieved flexibility through important engineering changes to take advantage of the lowest cost energy source in most significant processes 
specifically  the company s principal manufacturing processes can now be operated with natural gas  propane  oil or electricity  or a combination of these energy sources 
as to resources ores  minerals  and processed chemicals required in manufacturing operations  availability appears to be adequate 
corning s suppliers from time to time may experience capacity limitations in their own operations  or may eliminate certain product lines  nevertheless  corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch chemicals and raw materials 
for many products  corning has alternative glass compositions that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages 
patents and trademarks inventions by members of corning s research and engineering staff have been  and continue to be  important to the company s growth 
patents have been granted on many of these inventions in the united states and other countries 
some of these patents have been licensed to other manufacturers  including corning s associated companies 
many of the earlier patents have now expired 
most of corning s products are marketed under the following trademarks corning  corning ware  celcor  corelle  corguide  impressions  puma  pyrex  pyrex portables  visions  steuben and vycor 
subsidiaries of corning frequently use their own trademarks  such as revere ware  and costar 
protection of the environment corning has a program to ensure that its facilities are in compliance with state  federal and foreign pollution control regulations 
this program resulted in capital and operating expenditures during the past several years 
in order to maintain compliance with such regulations  capital expenditures for pollution control by continuing operations were approximately million in and are estimated to be million in corning s operating results from continuing operations were charged with approximately million for depreciation  maintenance  waste disposal  and other operating expenses associated with pollution control 
the level of these costs is not expected to change substantially in corning believes that its compliance program will not place it at a competitive disadvantage

quest diagnostics has entered into several settlement agreements with various governmental and private payors during recent years 
government investigations of certain practices by clinical laboratories acquired in recent years are ongoing 
in the second quarter  the us department of justice doj notified quest diagnostics that it had taken issue with certain payments received by damon corporation damon from federally funded healthcare programs prior to its acquisition by quest diagnostics 
during the second and third quarters  quest diagnostics management met with the government several times to evaluate the substance of the government s allegations 
as a result of these discussions  in october  quest diagnostics management  on behalf of its damon subsidiary  reached a settlement agreement with the doj which caused quest diagnostics to pay million to the government 
as a result of this settlement agreement  quest diagnostics management reassessed the level of reserves recorded for other asserted and unasserted claims related to the damon and other related and similar government investigations  including the investigation of billing practices by nichols institute nichols prior to its acquisition by quest diagnostics in during  quest diagnostics recorded charges totaling million after tax to increase its reserves to equal the damon settlement and quest diagnostics management s best estimate of potential amounts which could be required to satisfy the remaining claims 
corning has agreed to indemnify quest diagnostics on an after tax basis  for the settlement of claims against nichols and certain other claims that were pending at december  coincident with the distributions  corning recorded a payable to quest diagnostics of approximately million which is equal to management s best estimate of amounts which are probable of being paid by corning to quest diagnostics to satisfy the remaining indemnified claims on an after tax basis 
although management believes that established reserves for indemnified claims are sufficient  it is possible that additional information may become available to quest diagnostics management which may cause the final resolution of these matters to exceed established reserves by an amount which could be material to corning s results of operations and cash flow in the period in which such claims are settled 
management does not believe that these issues will have a material adverse impact on corning s overall financial condition 
corning  quest diagnostics and covance have entered into tax indemnification agreements that prohibit quest diagnostics and covance for a period of two years after the distributions from taking certain actions that might jeopardize the favorable tax treatment of the distributions and provide corning with certain rights of indemnification against quest diagnostics and covance 
the tax indemnification agreements also require quest diagnostics and covance to take such actions as corning may request to preserve the favorable tax treatment provided for in the ruling obtained from the internal revenue service in respect of the distributions 
corning  quest diagnostics and covance have also entered into a tax sharing agreement which allocates among corning  quest diagnostics and covance responsibility for federal  state and local taxes relating to taxable periods before and after the distributions and provides for computing and apportioning tax liabilities and tax benefits for such periods among the parties 
quest diagnostics and covance have paid or will pay corning for all income taxes due at december  corning will indemnify quest diagnostics and covance for any adjustments to these liabilities resulting from future audits of corning s consolidated federal and certain other tax returns for periods prior to the distribution date 
liquidity and capital resources corning s working capital increased from million at the end of to million at the end of the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at the end of compared to at year end corning s long term debt as a percentage of total capital was percent at the end of  compared to percent at the end of the increase in these ratios is primarily due to the impact of the distributions on corning s balance sheet 
the increase in the percentage of long term debt to total capital is due primarily to the billion reduction in stockholders equity as a result of the distributions of quest diagnostics and covance 
during the fourth quarter of  quest diagnostics and covance borrowed approximately million from third party lenders and repaid intercompany debt to corning prior to the distributions 
corning used the proceeds from the repayment of intercompany debt to repay approximately million of short term borrowings and million of long term debt
