item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in november  the company completed a second public offering of common stock and contributed the net proceeds of million to the capital of us can 
the net proceeds were used by us can to prepay a portion of the outstanding balance of its revolving line of credit 
since  the company has made a number of acquisitions 
in  the company acquired the stock of steeltin and the assets of two affiliated companies  eastern metal decorating  inc emd and eastern container company  inc ecc steeltin  emd and ecc collectively referred to hereinafter as steeltin  assets from midwest can company midwest  the stock of ellisco  the stock of rollason engineering manufacturing  inc rollason  the assets of a lithography plant from ball corporation  and the metal packaging operations of grafco industries limited partnership grafco 
in  the company acquired the stock of plastite  hunter container corporation hunter and metal litho international and the assets of a related partnership mli  as well as certain assets of prospect industries corporation prospect 
in april  the company acquired the assets of ams 
the stock of the cpi group and the stock and assets of usc europe were acquired in august and september  respectively 
results of operations year ended december   as compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of over the corresponding period in companies acquired by us can during the first three quarters of  including usc europe  added approximately million to sales in the company has also realized additional sales as a result of the mli  plastite  hunter and prospect acquisitions in and the ams  cpi group and usc europe acquisitions in sales gains for the year also reflect volume growth in substantially all of the company s products 
gross income gross income of million for was million  or  higher than gross income for the acquisitions and higher margins on certain products contributed to this increase 
volume gains in with stable costs contributed to improved performance 
gross margin increased to of net sales in from of net sales in despite a significant advance purchase of steel in late which resulted in the company not realizing the full impact of the steel price increase in the first quarter of in  margins  as well as sales  were negatively impacted by weak second half demand 
in  the fourth quarter and full year were impacted by the somewhat lower margins of acquired businesses and seasonality of the new european operations 
however  these were more than offset by improved sales and margins in core operations 
us can expects the integration of acquired operations will improve overall margins 
however  progress will be limited during the first half of by the start up of two plants in europe  one in the us and the relocation of another domestic operation 
operating income the company s operating income of million for was million  or  higher than operating income for income was favorably impacted by increased sales  improved margins and the effect of an overhead reduction program begun in late operating income as a percent of net sales was for as compared to for the company experienced an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during  primarily due to acquisitions 
however  these expenses as a percent of net sales decreased from of net sales in to of net sales in increased diversification into metal services  plastics and europe is expected to temporarily restrain operating margin growth until those new operations are assimilated into the company 
interest and other expenses interest expense on borrowings increased by approximately million in as compared to the increase is a result of increased borrowing  primarily to finance the company s acquisitions and the refinancing of shorter term bank debt with a portion of the proceeds of the million note issue in october amortization of deferred financing costs and other expense remained flat in as compared to the company believes more permanent long term capital is the most appropriate means to finance acquisitions  and  due to strong demand  it was able to borrow million more than originally planned in the note offering 
as a result  repayment of lower cost  shorter term debt with the note proceeds will continue to generate somewhat higher interest expense even though a portion of the proceeds was used to redeem higher cost bonds 
net income for  income before extraordinary item was million  more than four times the million reported in during  the company redeemed its notes with the proceeds from the issuance of the notes 
the early extinguishment of the notes resulted in an extraordinary charge of million net of income taxes of million primarily representing a prepayment premium and the write off of related unamortized deferred financing costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
earnings per share before extraordinary item were for the year 
after the extraordinary item  the company had net income of million per share in compared to net income of million per share in year ended december   as compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december   totaled million  an increase of over net sales in the acquisition of ellisco and acquisitions completed in were the primary factors contributing to the sales growth 
increased volume in metal services also contributed to the sales growth 
sales of aerosol containers were down slightly  while sales of round and general line containers increased slightly  compared to the company believes the weak demand in its core product lines was due to summer weather conditions unfavorable for outdoor activities and painting and due to inventory adjustments by major retailers which use the company s products 
the company experienced some increased demand in aerosol and round paint containers in the fourth quarter of but demand did not return fully to more traditional levels until december 
gross income gross income for was million  lower than gross income in weak second half demand for aerosol  round and general line containers resulted in underutilization of manufacturing capacity 
this underutilization and lower than anticipated income contributions from certain acquisitions contributed to the decrease in gross income 
competitive pressures in the face of weak demand precluded the company from fully recovering cost increases with corresponding increases in selling prices 
gross margin decreased from of net sales in to of net sales in operating income during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an million pretax charge for a plant consolidation and overhead reduction program 
the primary components of the charge include costs associated with severance packages and the cessation of manufacturing at the saddle brook  new jersey facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in  as compared to  due to acquisitions and the costs associated with the terminated massilly  sa investment 
this provision  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and the factors described above resulted in operating income of million for  compared to million in operating income before the overhead reduction provision was million 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  were for both and interest and other expenses interest expense on borrowings increased by million in  as compared to the increase is a result of increased borrowing primarily to finance the ellisco acquisition in and the mli  plastite  prospect and hunter acquisitions in  net of the effect of using the net proceeds from the company s public offering of common stock in to reduce debt 
amortization of deferred financing costs and other expense also increased in the increase was primarily a result of new borrowings and goodwill amortization related to acquisitions 
net income as a result of the factors discussed above  the company recorded net income of million per share in  compared to million per share in net income was adversely affected by million per share as a result of the overhead reduction provision 
liquidity and capital resources during the last three fiscal years  the company has met its liquidity needs primarily through internally generated cash flows  borrowings under its credit lines and proceeds of securities offerings 
principal liquidity needs have included operations  repayment of indebtedness and related interest  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
the company completed the sale of the notes in october  in order to refinance the notes with lower interest debt  to retire the temporary acquisition financing incurred in  including the usc europe acquisition  and  generally  to replace shorter term  variable rate bank financing with longer term  fixed rate financing 
from to  the company improved its cash flow from operations through increased unit volumes  improved operating efficiencies  control of selling  general and administrative costs and careful management of inventory and receivables 
cash flow in was negatively impacted by higher material costs  competitive pricing  weak demand in major markets and retail inventory adjustments 
cash flow in returned to more historic levels 
the company actively manages its working capital as both inventories and receivables increase due to increased sales 
the usc europe acquisition will have an adverse impact on consolidated inventory turns and receivable days outstanding due to business practices in europe 
in april  us can entered into the credit agreement providing a million line of credit  consisting of a million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility and a million term loan the term loan 
funds available under the credit agreement have been and may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
obligations under the credit agreement are currently secured by us can s inventories and accounts receivable 
in december  the term loan was repaid in full  primarily with a borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
this repayment increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility and reduced the fee payable under the credit agreement for unused credit availability 
in early april  the lenders under the credit agreement the lenders provided a temporary million increase in the revolving credit facility due to seasonal inventory requirements 
in late april  the lenders provided an additional temporary million increase in the revolving credit facility to fund the ams acquisition 
in july  the lenders provided the company with an additional credit facility the acquisition facility to fund certain permitted acquisitions  including the usc europe and cpi group acquisitions 
all of the supplemental credit lines  including the acquisition facility  were terminated on october   the closing date of the note offering described in the following paragraph 
on october   us can corporation issued million of notes in a private placement 
of the million net proceeds to the company from the issuance  i approximately million was deposited in an escrow account and used to redeem us can s notes on january   and pay the remaining interest thereon  ii approximately million of the net proceeds was used to retire the acquisition facility  and iii approximately million of the net proceeds was used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
in march  the company completed a registered exchange of the private notes for freely transferable exchange notes the exchange offer 
all of the notes were tendered in the exchange offer and  as a result  only the exchange notes remain outstanding 
management believes that  through the note offering and the exchange offer  the company has improved its capital structure and  as a result  the company will be able to commit greater resources to its capital programs  thereby improving its cash flow 
as of december   the company s total debt was approximately million and scheduled principal payments excluding principal due on the revolving credit facility were approximately million  million  million  million and million for the years    and  respectively 
all amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are required to be repaid in april as of february   us can had borrowings of million outstanding under the credit agreement  million in letters of credit had been issued pursuant thereto and million of unused credit remained available thereunder 
as of december   us can was in compliance with the credit agreement and its other long term debt agreements 
cash flow from operations for the year ended december   as adjusted for interest payments of million during that period  was approximately million 
principal and interest requirements net of related income tax benefits and excluding such amounts due under the revolving credit facility are expected to be approximately million in  million in  million in and million in using cash flow from operations for the year ended december  as adjusted for interest payments during that period as a benchmark  assuming no increase or decrease in that cash flow from operations  the company s cash flow from operations at the level generated during this period would exceed principal and interest net of income taxes requirements excluding for the revolving credit facility for the years through the company s capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in in each case  these capital expenditures included investments in new can production lines  paint can line enhancements  advanced lithography technology and computer integrated manufacturing  to increase manufacturing capacity  reduce changeover times and improve productivity 
the company has also invested capital in plant expansions and the installation of state of the art end making presses and automated packaging equipment 
the company expects to spend approximately million on capital expenditures during the five years commencing in  in roughly equal annual amounts 
the company makes capital expenditures principally for improvements in the productivity and quality of lithography operations  continued technological enhancement of existing equipment  automation of existing processes  computer integrated manufacturing techniques  quality and service improvements  facility expansion  and  if necessary to meet demand  additional can making capacity 
for the new merthyr tydfil facility  the company has undertaken an investment of approximately million over a two to three year period  in order to establish a state of the art aerosol can manufacturing plant 
the company s capital investments have historically yielded reduced operating costs and improved the company s profit margins  and management believes that the strategic deployment of capital will enable the company to improve its overall profitability by leveraging the economies of scale inherent in the manufacture of containers 
management believes that cash flow from operations  amounts available under its credit facilities and proceeds from equipment financings should provide sufficient funds for the company s short term and long term capital expenditure and debt amortization requirements  and other cash needs in the ordinary course of business 
the company believes it will be able to refinance the revolving credit facility on or prior to maturity 
if future strategic acquisition opportunities arise  the company would expect to finance them though some combination of cash  stock and or debt financing

potential contingent payments are equal to of the amount  if any  by which an amount representing adjusted gross profit of the cpi group in and exceeds such amount for the year subsequent to the acquisition  the cpi group companies were merged into us can 
the company completed the usc europe acquisition on september  usc europe has aerosol can businesses located in the united kingdom  france  spain and germany  as well as certain aerosol can making equipment in italy 
the purchase price included million in cash and the assumption of net indebtedness totaling million  subject to a post closing adjustment for changes in working capital between april  and the closing of the usc europe acquisition on september  this adjustment is expected to equal at least million  reducing the net cash paid by the company for usc europe to approximately million 
while the company has historically aggressively sought acquisitions to implement its growth strategies  these objectives have largely been met with the completion of the acquisitions 
however  the company will continue to evaluate and selectively pursue acquisitions which it believes are strategically important to meeting its customers needs  attracting new customers  adding new products  complementing its existing business and expanding its geographic reach 
environmental matters the company s domestic and foreign operations are subject to extensive governmental regulatory requirements relating to environmental protection 
as part of its compliance effort  management has commissioned outside technical consultants to work in concert with the company s internal environmental group to implement a company wide environmental auditing program 
based on the audit results and reports prepared in connection with the acquisitions  management believes that the company s current operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  the violation of which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is in the process of integrating usc europe into its environmental management system and will be evaluating usc europe s ongoing compliance responsibilities during this process 
there can be no assurance that currently unknown matters  new laws and regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not materially affect the company s business or results of operations in the future 
as part of its commitment to capital investment in technology  the company has made  and expects to continue to make  significant capital expenditures to upgrade its facilities in accordance with current and pending environmental regulations 
approximately of the company s capital budget is environmentally related 
a program dedicating approximately million to upgrade the company s lithography centers to comply with scheduled clean air act requirements has been undertaken  of which million had been spent as of december  with respect to usc europe  a thermal oxidizer has been ordered and will be installed at the southall facility in england  at an estimated cost of approximately  to comply with uk air emissions regulations 
as of december   the company s reserves for future ascertainable costs of environmental remediation in the united states were approximately  management does not believe that such costs  if any  in excess of the reserve will have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in making this assessment  the company considered all information available to it including its and other companies reported prior experience in dealing with such matters  data released by the epa and reports by independent environmental consultants regarding certain matters 
in estimating the ascertainable costs of environmental remediation  management has not taken into account any potential insurance recovery 
in conjunction with its acquisitions  the company routinely obtains indemnification for environmental matters from the sellers 
such indemnification is typically subject to varying baskets or deductibles and maximum limitations  and is ultimately subject to the creditworthiness of the indemnitor s and in some cases the guarantor of the indemnity obligations 
with respect to the usc europe facilities  no subsurface sampling has been performed to identify possible contamination 
several of the facilities have been operating at their locations for more than ten years and  according to a survey conducted by an independent environmental consultant  it is likely that there have been releases of hazardous substances at these locations in the past 
however  management has been advised by an independent environmental consultant  familiar with united kingdom and german law and policy with respect to remediation requirements  that the local authorities are unlikely to propose or enforce stringent remediation requirements which would affect the commercial viability of either the german or the british facilities given their location in heavily industrialized areas 
moreover  the company has been indemnified by crown as to environmental conditions at these sites 
management believes that any future requirement to remediate these sites will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company received a request for information from the us epa in january  concerning the lithography operations at its chicago facility formerly owned by alltrista 
in march  representatives of the us epa inspected the chicago facility and requested additional information  including compliance tests and reports 
the company is cooperating fully with the us epa inquiry 
the company does not know what the outcome of this inquiry will be 
in the acquisition agreement between the company and alltrista  alltrista agreed to indemnify the company for compliance costs that relate back to alltrista s operation of this facility 
for a discussion of the san leandro  california environmental order  see legal proceedings and regulatory matters 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs and expenses in connection with this order 
in connection with a asset purchase  the company entered into an administrative consent order aco with the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep  requiring us can to investigate and remediate certain environmental concerns at the saddle brook  new jersey facility 
as part of the aco  us can deposited million into an escrow account  which us can may draw from to fund such activities 
the aco limits us can s liability under new jersey environmental laws in this respect to the million deposited in the escrow account 
this limitation does not  however  limit us can s liability for clean up costs resulting from its own activities in the event of a sale  or other transfer of control  of us can or the facility 
the company is working with the njdep to complete the remediation process 
the company does not believe the costs of remediation and monitoring will exceed the escrow amount 
as a potentially responsible party prp at various superfund sites in the us  the company is or may be legally responsible  jointly and severally with the other members of the prp group  for the cost of remediation of these sites 
based on currently available data including epa data  internal records and other sources believed to be reliable  the company believes its contribution  and or the contribution of its predecessors  to these sites was de minimis 
based on the information available as of the date of this report  management does not believe that its aggregate remediation costs or potential liabilities in connection with these sites will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the other prp s will pay their proportionate share of the remediation costs at these sites and  as a result  future costs or liabilities incurred by the company could be material 
with respect to each of the matters discussed above  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to pay environmental compliance costs or to incur liabilities that may be material in amount 
based on information available as of the date of this report  management does not believe that aggregate remediation costs or other liability in connection with the possible contamination at these sites would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
further  although at this time there are no environmental compliance costs which the company believes to be material there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to pay environmental compliance costs or to incur liabilities that may be material in amount due to matters which arise in the future or matters which are not known to the company as of the date of this report 
litigation for a discussion of the kiewit litigation  see legal proceedings and regulatory matters 
for a discussion of the san leandro  california remediation order  the us epa inquiry at the chicago plant and superfund sites affecting the company  see environmental matters 
the company is involved in various other environmental and legal actions and administrative proceedings 
management is of the opinion that the outcome of such other actions and proceedings will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
seasonality the company s business as a whole is not affected to any significant degree by seasonal variations  although quarterly sales and earnings tend to be slightly stronger starting in early spring second quarter and extending through late summer third quarter 
aerosol sales do not tend to fluctuate during the year  with only relatively minor spring and summer increases related to household products and insect repellents 
paint sales tend to be stronger in spring and early summer due to the favorable weather conditions 
portions of the custom and specialty products line tend to vary seasonally  because of holiday sales late in the year 
interest rates foreign currency management does not believe that interest rate fluctuations have a material effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
as of december   of the company s borrowings were floating rate obligations 
in the past  management has adopted strategies to increase the company s floating rate exposure to benefit from declining rates 
currently  the company holds no interest rate swaps 
however  in an effort to limit foreign exchange risk related to the financing of the merthyr tydfil facility  the company has entered into a series of british pound dollar forward contracts that will not exceed million in notional amount or a term of more than seven years 
the indenture under which the notes were issued limits the company s ability to enter into currency hedging transactions that would be considered speculative  such as transactions unrelated to repayment of indebtedness permitted by the indenture 
inflation historically  the company has not always been able to immediately offset increases in tin plate prices with price increases on the company s products 
however  in most years  a combination of factors has permitted the company to improve its profitability notwithstanding these conditions 
the company s capital spending programs and manufacturing process upgrades have increased operating efficiencies and thereby reduced the company s unit cost of production 
in addition  historically  the company has been able to negotiate lower price increases than those announced by its major suppliers 
see business raw materials 
the operating efficiencies and reduced unit cost of production which have been achieved through the company s capital spending programs have mitigated the impact of inflation on the company s cost structure 
in  higher material costs were one of the factors contributing to the company s reported earnings 
management does not believe inflation will have a material adverse impact on the company in the next several quarters 
customer relationships aerosol containers aerosol containers accounted for of the company s gross sales for the year ended december  a significant reduction in the number of aerosol containers used by the company s customers could have a material adverse effect on the company and  in particular  its european operations which are comprised solely of aerosol manufacturing facilities 
the company s manufacturing facility in merthyr tydfil is expected to be operational in mid the initial investment of approximately million  being expended over the next two to three years  was commenced on the strength of a commitment from gillette for a long term purchase arrangement in the uk the loss of gillette as a customer or a material reduction in the benefits to the company expected under this arrangement would have an adverse impact on the profitability of that facility and the company s ability to recoup the start up costs of establishing the facility 
the company s relationships with its customers are critical to its business 
a significant portion of the company s annual net sales is attributable to repeat customers 
the loss of a significant number of such customers could have a material adverse effect on the company
