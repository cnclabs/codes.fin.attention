item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the primary sources of revenue for wfs are servicing income  net interest income and gain on sale of contracts 
servicing income is primarily generated following the securitization of contracts purchased by wfs and consists of i contractual servicing fees  ii excess servicing income and iii other fee income such as late charges and documentation fees which are earned regardless of whether or not a securitization has occurred 
contractual servicing is the servicing fee contractually due from a trust for servicing contracts which have been securitized 
excess servicing is the cash flow derived from the excess spread remaining on contracts sold after contractual servicing fees have been paid 
late charges  deferment fees  documentation fees and other fees are also collected on contracts serviced and are retained by the company 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on contracts not yet sold in securitization transactions and the interest paid on the liabilities used to fund such contracts 
gain on sale of contracts is recognized based on the estimated present value of excess future cash flows on securitized contracts at the time of sale 
during  wfs purchased billion of contracts compared to billion in  an increase of 
after purchasing contracts  wfs generally securitizes its contracts and earns servicing income 
while contracts are held on balance sheet  wfs earns net interest income 
the company s securitization transactions during  and involved the sale of contracts to a trust in exchange for asset backed securities issued by the trust which wfs sells to investors 
wfs used an owner trust structure in see business hedging and securitization 
wfs continues to service the contracts following their securitization and receives a contractual servicing fee for such activities 
in connection with the securitization of contracts  wfs retains the right to receive excess spread which is equal to the difference between the stated interest rate on the contracts securitized and the interest rate on the asset backed securities  before adjustments for credit losses  administrative expenses and contractual servicing fees 
wfs securitized billion  billion and million of contracts during  and  respectively 
the following table lists each of the company s securitization transactions since march each of these transactions was rated aaa by s p  and aaa by moody s  their respective highest ratings

wfs computes a gain on sale with respect to contracts securitized based on the present value of the estimated future excess cash flows to be received from such contracts using a market discount rate 
gain on sale is recorded as excess servicing receivable on the balance sheet and is amortized against servicing income over the life of the contracts 
the gain recorded in the income statement is adjusted for prepaid dealer commissions  issuance costs and the effect of hedging activities 
see note a summary of significant accounting policies to wfs consolidated financial statements 
results of operations servicing income servicing income increased to million during compared to million during and million during  representing increases of and  respectively 
the increase in servicing income is the result of an increase in contracts serviced by wfs 
wfs regularly evaluates the methods and assumptions used to estimate the amounts due from trusts 
contractual servicing is earned at a rate of per annum on the outstanding balance of contracts securitized and is consistent with industry standards 
excess servicing income is dependent upon the average excess spread on the contracts sold and the performance of the contracts 
servicing fee income is related to the size of the serviced portfolio 
during the past three years  wfs increased its average serviced portfolio to billion in from billion and billion in and  respectively 
other fee income  consisting primarily of documentation fees  late charges and deferment fees  increased to million during compared to million and million in and  respectively  representing increases of and  respectively 
these increases in other fee income are related to the increase in the number of contracts purchased 
for the year ended december  excess servicing income    contractual servicing income    other fee income    total servicing income    servicing income may be impacted by changes in the amount of losses and amount and timing of prepayments 
increased credit losses reduce the amount of excess servicing income earned by wfs  although the extent of such losses is dependent upon the timing as well as the amount of the increases of such losses  if any 
furthermore  changes in the amount and timing of prepayments may also affect the amount and timing of excess servicing income 
the company believes that prepayments have not historically been affected by changes in interest rates or general economic conditions 
increased competition may also affect the amount of other fee income that wfs may earn when originating or servicing contracts 
wfs has completed securitization transactions to date since its first transaction in december of eleven of these transactions were on balance sheet collateralized bond offerings and the remaining were off balance sheet trusts 
seventeen transactions have been paid in full  all of which were paid on or before their contractual maturity dates 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between the rate earned on contracts held on balance sheet and the interest costs associated with the company s borrowings 
net interest income totalled million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the following table shows the average rate earned on contracts and the average rate paid on borrowings  consisting primarily of advances from the bank  together with the corresponding net interest rate spread for years ended  and for the year ended december  yield on contracts cost of borrowings net interest rate spread as wfs securitizes its on balance sheet contracts  revenue previously recognized as net interest income will  upon such securitization  be recognized as servicing income 
prior to securitizing contracts  wfs earns interest income on its contracts  pays interest expense to fund the contracts and absorbs any credit losses 
after securitization  the net cash flows are recorded as servicing income 
to protect against changes in interest rates  wfs hedges contracts prior to their securitization with forward agreements 
gains or losses on these forward agreements are deferred and included as part of the basis of the underlying contracts and recognized when the contracts are securitized 
see capital resources and liquidity 
the company s primary source of borrowings has been advances from its parent 
these advances were provided on an as needed basis at a weighted average rate equal to in  in and in the cost of borrowings reflects the bank s actual cost of funds for for and  the cost of borrowings represents the average combined rate of the senior note and the line of credit 
see capital resources and liquidity and transactions with affiliates 
gain on sale of contracts wfs recorded gain on sale of contracts of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in gain on sale reported in is the result of the increase in amount of securitized contracts as well as higher gross interest rate spreads for securitization transactions completed in as compared to those completed in and while the assumptions used in determining gain on sale of contracts have not changed significantly during the last three years  gain on sale of contracts has fluctuated as a result of changes in the gross interest rate spread of contracts securitized as shown in the table under overview 
gross interest rate spread is affected by product mix  general market conditions and overall market interest rates 
the risks inherent in interest rate fluctuation are substantially reduced through hedging activities 
provision for credit losses the company maintains an allowance for credit losses to cover anticipated losses on the contracts held on balance sheet 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by charging the provision for credit losses and decreased by actual losses on the contracts held on balance sheet or by the reduction of contracts held on balance sheet 
the level of the allowance is determined based principally on the outstanding balance of contracts held on balance sheet  pending sales of contracts and historical loss trends 
when wfs sells contracts in a securitization transaction  it reduces its allowance for credit losses and factors potential losses into its calculation of gain on sale 
wfs believes that the allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to absorb potential losses in the owned portfolio 
see note a summary of significant accounting policies to wfs consolidated financial statements 
during  the provision for credit losses totalled million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in provision for credit losses in was due to higher loss experience as well as an increase in the level of allowance for credit losses 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expense  credit and collections expense  telephone expense  management fees and other miscellaneous costs 
over the past three years  these expenses have increased as wfs has expanded 
at the end of  wfs operated in four states through dealer centers and branch offices 
as of december   wfs operated in states through dealer centers and branch offices 
as a new branch or dealer center is established  the costs of additional personnel  office space and other operating expenses of approximately  per month are incurred 
a new branch office or dealer center also typically incurs approximately  in initial  nonrecurring costs 
as the servicing portfolio increases  costs related to credit  collection  telephone and other related expenses increase as well 
wfs has recently begun to implement additional technology pertaining to its computerized front end application processing system designed to improve its operating efficiency by electronically collecting credit data on applicants and other information used in the underwriting of applications for contracts and arranging that information for review and analysis by either a dealer center division credit officer or a branch division branch manager 
total operating expenses in were million  up from million in total operating expenses in increased from million in the increases in total operating expenses are primarily attributable to expansion 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
this increase is largely due to an increase in the number of employees necessary to open new dealer centers and branch offices and to service the increased number of contracts purchased 
as a result of the opening of new dealer centers and branch offices  occupancy expense  including depreciation expense  increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
other operating expenses include credit and collections costs  telephone and miscellaneous other expenses 
credit and collections expense increased to million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
telephone expense totalled million in compared to million in and million in miscellaneous expenses  which include travel  marketing  stationery  supplies  postage  legal and professional fees and other ancillary costs  increased to million in compared to million and million for and  respectively 
these expenses have increased as a result of a increase in the annual compounded growth rate of contracts serviced since december  and as a result of wfs expansion 
wfs pays a monthly management fee to the bank and westcorp which covers various expenses  including data processing  accounting  payroll  legal  tax  cash management  purchasing and auditing services and is shown on the income statement as general and administrative costs paid to parent 
the management fee is based upon the actual costs incurred and estimates of actual usage 
wfs believes that the management fee approximates the cost to perform these services on its own behalf or to acquire them from third parties 
wfs has the option  under the management agreements  to procure these services on its own should it be more economically beneficial to wfs to do so 
in  management fee expense was million compared to million in and million in see transactions with affiliates management agreements 
on january   various administrative departments of westcorp were transferred to the bank and wfs as part of a restructuring plan to provide greater focus and specialization within each company 
as part of this plan  westcorp will only retain certain administrative operations including payroll  human resources and certain treasury functions 
income taxes wfs files federal and certain state tax returns as part of a consolidated group that includes the bank and westcorp  the holding company parent of the bank 
other state tax returns are filed by wfs as a separate entity 
tax liabilities from the consolidated returns are allocated in accordance with a tax sharing agreement based on the relative income or loss of each entity on a stand alone basis 
the effective tax rate for wfs was for compared to and for and  respectively 
see transactions with affiliates tax sharing agreement 
financial condition contracts receivable and contracts held for sale wfs holds a portfolio of contracts on balance sheet for investment that totalled million at december  and million at december  contracts held for sale totalled million at december  compared to million at december  the balance in the held for sale portfolio is largely dependent upon the timing of the origination and securitization of contracts 
wfs completed securitization transactions of billion during wfs plans to continue to securitize contracts on a regular basis 
see note a summary of significant accounting policies to wfs consolidated financial statements 
amounts due from trusts the excess cash flow generated by contracts sold to trusts is deposited into spread accounts by the trustee under the terms of the securitization transactions 
in addition  at the time a securitization transaction closes  wfs advances additional monies to initially fund these spread accounts 
these funds  as well as the excess spread  are paid to wfs after the spread accounts reach a predetermined funding level 
amounts due from trusts represent funds due to wfs not yet disbursed from the spread accounts 
the amounts due from trusts at year end was million compared with million at year end the increase is a result of the increase in total contracts securitized and outstanding 
excess servicing receivable excess servicing receivable consists of the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be received by wfs from the excess spread created in securitizations 
the estimated future cash flows are determined by taking into account certain assumptions principally regarding prepayments  credit losses and servicing costs 
these cash flows are then discounted at a rate management believes to be at market 
the balance of the excess servicing receivable is then amortized against actual servicing income on a monthly basis 
the assumptions used are evaluated each quarter and adjusted  if appropriate  to reflect performance of the contracts 
for the year ended december  beginning balance    additions    amortization    ending balance    the following table presents the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be received from securitizations  net of estimated costs to service and after giving effect to estimated prepayments 
to arrive at the excess servicing receivable  this amount is reduced by the off balance sheet allowance established for future losses and by discounting these cash flows to present value 
december  estimated net undiscounted cash flows  off balance sheet allowance for losses  discount to present value  excess servicing receivable  outstanding balance of contracts sold through securitizations  off balance sheet allowance for losses as a percent of contracts sold through securitizations wfs believes that the off balance sheet allowance for losses is currently adequate to absorb potential losses in the sold portfolio 
additions to excess servicing receivable result from new securitizations and reflect the estimated present value of the future cash flows of the contracts securitized 
the amortization of excess servicing receivable presented above represents the scheduled amortization based upon the assumptions underlying the calculation of the estimated present value of the remaining future cash flows 
asset quality servicing income is affected by the quality of the underlying contracts purchased and securitized by wfs 
servicing contracts includes managing delinquent contracts  repossessing and selling autos  securing defaulted contracts and recovering deficiency balances 
a delinquent contract is one on which payment has not been made by the delinquency date  generally days  following the due date on which such payment was contractually due 
wfs monitors and attempts to minimize delinquencies and losses through an online collections system 
at december   delinquencies for the serviced portfolio was based on the dollar amount of contracts outstanding compared to and at december  and net chargeoffs on average contracts outstanding during the period totalled at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
see business maintain solid asset quality 
capital resources and liquidity wfs requires substantial capital resources to operate its business 
the resources available to wfs include contract securitizations  borrowings under the line of credit and collections of principal and interest from contracts 
these sources provide capital to fund expanding purchases of contracts 
wfs may also enter into a commercial paper facility insured by fsa 
the primary source of funds for wfs is the securitization of contracts 
wfs has regularly securitized contracts through underwritten public sales of aaa aaa rated securities since although the underlying interest costs associated with securitizations fluctuate  they are primarily market driven and not necessarily related to the operations of wfs 
wfs expects to continue to utilize securitization transactions as part of its liquidity strategy  although no assurance can be given due to changing market conditions 
the major components of cash flows related to operating activities are cash needed to purchase contracts which totalled billion in compared to billion in and billion in it is anticipated that contracts purchased will continue to be the major cash need of wfs 
operating activities also generate cash flows through principal receipts on contracts 
during  these cash flows totalled million  compared to million in and million in the investing activities of wfs primarily relate to utilizing funds collected on behalf of the trusts to assist in funding its operating activities 
these cash flows historically have provided a consistent source of cash for wfs 
wfs financing is provided by the bank under the terms of its million senior note and its million line of credit 
the senior note is unsecured and has a fixed interest rate of and a final maturity in wfs uses the line of credit primarily to fund its purchase of contracts from dealers and from consumers  which contracts are held for sale until securitized 
wfs does not pay a commitment fee to the bank for the line of credit 
when wfs consummates a securitization  it uses the proceeds to pay down its warehouse line with the bank  making the warehouse line available to purchase new contracts 
the rate of interest on the line is based upon a margin over the federal composite commercial paper rate  with the margin increasing from to basis points to the extent the borrowings are not secured 
wfs has the option of determining whether and to what extent the line will be secured 
it is anticipated that the line will generally be paid down following each securitization transaction  although wfs is not required to do so 
wfs believes that the cost of the warehouse line with the bank approximates the cost of warehouse lines from third parties 
see business transactions with affiliates 
these financing sources are expected to provide adequate funding of the company s operations and the company believes that its sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet its long and short term cash requirements 
principal and interest collections on owned and securitized contracts provide additional cash flow 
wfs may use the collections on contracts not securitized without limitations in its operations 
wfs may also use collections of principal and interest from securitized contracts as long as they are deposited into a ric at the bank 
see businesstransactions with affiliates 
as wfs increases the size of its servicing portfolio  the company expects such amounts to increase 
hence  wfs is able to utilize principal and interest collections on contracts sold in its day to day operations until payments are due to the investors  thus providing an additional source of cash flow 
asset liability management asset liability management is the process of measuring and controlling interest rate risk through matching the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets with those of interest bearing liabilities 
the contracts originated and held by wfs are all fixed rate and accordingly wfs has exposure to changes in interest rates 
wfs prepayment experience on contracts has not been historically sensitive to changes in interest rates and wfs therefore believes it is not expected to be exposed to significant prepayment risk relative to changes in interest rates 
as a result of this approach to interest rate management  combined with the company s hedging strategies  wfs does not anticipate that changes in interest rates will materially affect the company s results of operations or liquidity  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
the company s hedging strategy includes the use of two year treasury securities forward agreements 
these agreements are entered into by the company in numbers and amounts which generally correspond to the principal amount of the securitization transactions 
the market value of these forward agreements responds inversely to the market value changes of the underlying contracts 
because of this inverse relationship  wfs can effectively lock in its gross interest rate spread at the time of the hedge transaction 
gains and losses relative to these agreements are deferred and recognized in full at the time of securitization as an adjustment to the gain or loss on the sale of the contracts 
wfs uses only highly rated counterparties and further reduces its risk by avoiding any material concentration with a single counterparty 
credit exposure is limited to those agreements with a positive fair value and only to the extent of that fair value 
see note b net contracts receivable to wfs consolidated financial statements 
management monitors the company s hedging activities on a daily basis to ensure that the value of hedges  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
the amount and timing of hedging transactions are determined by senior management of wfs based upon the monitoring activities of the company 
wfs hedges substantially all of its contracts pending securitization either through outside parties or affiliated entities 
effect of inflation and changing prices unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of wfs are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant effect on wfs s performance than the general level of inflation 
see asset liability management 
forward looking statements the preceding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of which provides a new safe harbor for these types of statements 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements which reflect wfs current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those identified below  which could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated
