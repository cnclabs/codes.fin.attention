capital resources available to the company include an existing line of credit for working capital 
the current line is a maximum of million based on accounts receivable and work in progress  of which approximately  is currently available 
an agreement is being negotiated whereby the line of credit may be reduced 
the line of credit is also a demand note and requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants 
to date  the company has maintained these covenants and believes that its working capital and existing or reduced line of credit are adequate to meet current fiscal year requirements 
if the company should fail to meet these covenants or should the bank demand payment on the note  there would be a material adverse financial impact 
the company is not aware of any reason for the bank to demand payment and does not expect that it would do so in the future although the bank has recently announced that they are being acquired 
the company is planning to continue its program of purchasing computer assisted design and drafting equipment 
in the long term the company relies on the ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to fund investing and financing requirements 
if demand for services should increase sharply  additional sources of financing may be required 
the company is currently involved in two lawsuits  skinner and american continental properties 
if the outcome of these lawsuits is adverse  the company may be required to pay substantial deductibles or indemnification 
the company believes that it will be able to finance any adverse finding through the use of an income tax carryback of the resulting loss in combination with the line of credit and existing resources 
the company is vigorously pursuing its defenses  and management believes the final resolution of these legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements
