the company provides financing and asset securitization execution and expertise to the strategic alliance client while the client provides a consistent flow of securitizable assets to the company 
in certain strategic alliances  the company receives interests strategic alliance equity interests in the strategic alliance client 
the realization of value on such strategic alliance equity interests is subject to many factors  including the future growth and profitability of the strategic alliance clients and the completion of initial public offerings or sale of such strategic alliance clients 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company acquired three home equity companies and one auto finance company to implement growth strategies of expanding into the western united states  diversifying into retail origination and owning other asset origination platforms with which the company has significant securitization experience 
the four new loan origination subsidiaries  california lending group  inc d b a united lending group  inc 
ulg  royal mortgage partners  lp  d b a royal mortgagebanc royal  triad financial corporation triad  and resource one consumer discount company  inc resource one  collectively called the acquisitions  are discussed below on november   the company purchased of the outstanding stock of ulg  a west coast based home equity lender specializing in retail originations via direct mail and telemarketing throughout the united states 
on november   the company  through its subsidiary contimortgage  purchased of royal 
royal is a california headquartered wholesale and retail originator of fixed and adjustable rate home equity loans 
on november   the company acquired a equity interest in triad and an additional in january  a california based non prime auto finance company 
the company has the right and obligation to acquire the remaining common stock of triad from existing shareholders 
on december   the company  through its subsidiary contimortgage  purchased of the outstanding stock of resource one 
resource one  headquartered in langhorne  pennsylvania  is a retail branch home equity loan originator that utilizes direct mail  television  telemarketing  referrals and other sources to generate loan inquiries directly from borrowers 
in each case  the companies acquired were former strategic alliances or contimortgate loan origination sources 
the acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases  and the results of operations have been included with the company s results of operations since the effective acquisition dates 
the cumulative purchase price was approximately million  which includes deferred payments of approximately million  resulting in approximately million of cost in excess of equity which will be amortized on a straight line basis over a year useful life 
certain acquisition s terms contain payments which are contingent upon future earnings or employment of key management 
such contingent payments will be recorded as purchase price or compensation as is appropriate for the nature of the payments 
the company has a right and obligation to purchase the remaining of the common stock of triad over the next years 
the purchase price will be based upon the future earnings of triad and will be recorded when determinable 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired will be recorded as an increase in cost in excess of equity 
the acquisitions are not material to the financial position or results of operations of the company 
certain accounting considerations as a fundamental part of its business and financing strategy  the company sells substantially all of its loans or other assets through securitization in the form of remics  owner trusts or grantor trusts 
in a securitization  the company sells loans or other assets that it has originated or purchased to a trust for a cash purchase price and an interest in the loans or other assets securitized in the form of the excess spread 
the cash purchase price is raised through an offering of pass through certificates by the trust 
following the securitization  the purchasers of the pass through certificates receive the principal collected and the investor pass through interest rate on the certificate balance  while the company receives the excess spread 
the excess spread represents  over the life of the loans or other assets  the excess of the weighted average coupon on each pool of loans or other assets sold over the sum of the pass through interest rate plus a normal servicing fee  a trustee fee  an insurance fee and an estimate of annual future credit losses related to the loans or other assets securitized the excess spread 
these cash flows are projected over the life of the loans or other assets using prepayment  default  and interest rate assumptions that market participants would use for similar financial instruments subject to prepayment  credit and interest rate risk and are discounted using an interest rate that a purchaser unrelated to the seller of such a financial instrument would demand 
the majority of the company s gross income is recognized as gain on sale of loans or other assets  which represents the value of the excess spread less origination and underwriting costs 
the present value of the excess spread is the excess spread receivable the excess spread receivable 
the excess spread receivable is either a contractual right or a certificated security generally in the form of an interest only or residual certificate 
the majority of the company s excess spread receivable at march  and is interest only and residual certificates 
consequently  the company s consolidated balance sheets designate excess spread receivable as interest only and residual certificates 
the company recognizes the gain on sale of loans or other assets in the fiscal year in which such loans or other assets are sold  although cash representing the excess spread and servicing fees is received by the company over the life of the loans or other assets 
concurrent with recognizing such gain on sale  the company records the excess spread receivable as an asset on its consolidated balance sheets 
the excess spread receivable is reduced as cash distributions are received from the securitization 
due to the fact that the gain recognized in the year of sale is equal to the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the excess spread  the amount of cash actually received over the lives of the loans or other assets normally exceeds the gain previously recognized at the time the loans or other assets were sold and therefore interest income is recognized over the life of the loans or other assets securitized 
in periods subsequent to the sale  the company may recognize an increase in fair value of excess spread receivable as gain on sale of receivables to the extent that estimates of the loan pools future remaining lives exceed those originally projected 
this estimate of extended life is performed by reviewing past prepayment experience and estimating future prepayment experience by considering numerous factors which include current market assumptions  the interest rate environment and economic factors 
if actual prepayments with respect to sold loans occur faster or credit experience is worse than projected at the time such loans were sold  the carrying value of the excess spread receivable may have to be written down through a charge to earnings in the period of adjustment 
additionally  upon sale or securitization of servicing retained mortgages  the company capitalizes the cost associated with the right to service mortgage loans based on its relative fair value 
the company determines fair value based on the present value of estimated net future cash flows related to servicing income 
the cost allocated to the servicing rights is amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net future servicing fee income 
the company periodically reviews capitalized servicing fees receivable for valuation impairment 
this review is performed on a disaggregated basis for the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans which are loan type  loan to value ratio and credit quality 
the company generally makes loans to credit impaired borrowers whose borrowing needs may not be met by traditional financial institutions due to credit exceptions 
the company has found that credit impaired borrowers are payment sensitive rather than interest rate sensitive 
as such the company does not consider interest rates a predominant risk characteristic for purposes of valuation impairment 
impairment is recognized in a valuation allowance for each disaggregated stratum in the period of impairment 
on january   the company adopted the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities sfas which addresses the accounting for transfers of financial assets in which the transferor has some continuing involvement either with the assets transferred or with the transferee 
a transfer of financial assets in which the transferor surrenders control over those assets is accounted for as a sale to the extent that consideration other than beneficial interest in the transferred assets is received in exchange 
sfas requires that liabilities and derivatives incurred or obtained by transferors as part of a transfer of financial assets be initially measured at fair value  if practicable 
in addition  sfas requires that servicing assets and liabilities be subsequently measured by the amortization over their estimated life and assessment of asset impairment be based on such assets fair value 
sfas is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after december   and is to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
however  certain of the assets that the company had sold under the purchase and sale facilities subsequent to january  did not qualify for sale treatment under sfas and as a result million of such assets were included as trade receivables sold under agreements to repurchase on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
sfas does not in any way effect the ability of the company to finance these assets 
the company expects to replace the purchase and sale facilities with repurchase agreements for those asset types which do not qualify for sale treatment 
financial condition march  securities purchased under agreements to resell increased million from million at march  to million at march  the company hedges  in part  its interest rate exposure on its receivables held for sale and loans and other assets sold  with recourse  under its purchase and sale facilities  through the use of united states treasury securities and futures contracts 
securities purchased under agreements to resell are part of this hedging strategy 
this increase was due primarily to the increase in the company s securitization volume in fiscal as compared to fiscal interest only and residual certificates increased million from million at march  to million at march  excluding million of interest only and residual certificates relating to the acquisitions  the march  balance increased by million from march  this increase represents million recorded during fiscal relating to new securitizations and recorded interest income of million partially offset by million of sales and million of collections 
capitalized servicing fees receivable increased million from million at march  to million at march  this balance reflects the capitalization of million of servicing rights and million of prepayment premiums paid partially offset by amortization of million 
trade receivables  net increased million from million at march  to million at march  excluding million of trade receivables  net relating to the acquisitions  the march  balance increased by million from march  this increase was primarily due to an increase in receivables held for sale from million as of march  to million at march   and partially due to the increase in other receivables from million at march  to million at march  the increase in receivables held for sale was primarily due to the adoption of sfas on january  as of march   million of receivables held for sale under the purchase and sale facilities were categorized as financing under sfas and classified as trade receivables sold under agreements to repurchase 
in addition to the sfas classification  there was an additional increase of million of receivables held for sale due to an overall increase in securitization volume from fiscal to fiscal the increase in other receivables of million from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in servicing advances of million and an increase in short term receivables of million 
the increase in servicing advances was due to advances made by contimortgage on loans in the servicing system 
contimortgage  as servicer  is contractually liable to pay the remic for certain delinquencies and then collects the past due amounts from the borrower 
this increase is because of an overall dollar increase in delinquencies from fiscal to fiscal the increase in short term receivables is due to timing differences in receiving loan payments from third party intermediaries 
premises and equipment  net increased million from million at march  to million at march  excluding million of premises and equipment relating to the acquisitions  the march  balance decreased by million from march  this decrease was primarily as a result of office equipment acquisitions which were more than offset by the normal periodic depreciation of owned equipment 
cost in excess of equity increased million from million at march  to million at march  the increase was primarily due to the costs in excess of equity recorded upon the purchase of the acquisitions made by the company during the third quarter of fiscal other assets increased million from million at march  to million at march  excluding the effects of the acquisitions  march  other assets increased by million from march  other assets represents prepaid expenses  margin and other deposits  deferred bond issuance costs and other investments

accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million from million at march  to million at march  excluding million of accounts payable and accrued expenses relating to the acquisitions  the march  balance increased by million from march  the balance increased primarily due to an increase in accrued taxes payable of million  incentive accruals of approximately million  accruals for securitization obligations of million  accrued interest payable of million  accrued pension and health care costs of approximately million offset by a decrease in accrued amounts payable under the company s purchase and sale facilities of approximately million 
the increases in accrued taxes payable  and accruals for securitization obligations were due to increased securitization volume  producing higher net income in fiscal the increase in incentive accruals in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the deferral of payments 
the increase in accrued pension and healthcare costs was due to an increase in the number of employees excluding the acquisitions to in fiscal as compared to employees in fiscal the decrease in accrued amounts payable under the company s purchase and sale facilities was due to a timing difference in the amounts payable under these obligations 
securities sold but not yet purchased increased million from million at march  to million at march  the company hedges  in part  its interest rate exposure on its receivables held for sale and loans and other assets sold with recourse under its purchase and sale facilities through the use of united states treasury securities and futures contracts 
securities sold but not yet purchased are part of this hedging strategy 
this increase was due primarily to the increase in the company s securitization volume in fiscal from fiscal payables to affiliates decreased million from million at march  to million at march  in connection with the company s ipo on february   continental grain company continental grain provided financing with three notes totaling million 
these notes were refinanced principally with the net proceeds of the senior notes  as defined below

on august   the company issued the million unsecured senior notes due the senior notes and on march   the company issued the million unsecured senior notes due the senior notes collectively the senior notes  resulting in million of the balance sheet increase in long term debt from march  the senior notes were issued at a discount which is being amortized over the life of the senior notes 
the remaining million of long term debt represents amounts payable under a long term capitalized lease 
other liabilities increased million from million at march  to million at march  excluding the effects of the acquisitions  march  other liabilities increased by million from march  the increase is primarily due to the accrual of contingent payments relating to the acquisitions 
stockholders equity increased million from million at march  to million at march  due to net income of million  the amortization of deferred compensation of million and the exercise of stock options of million 
excluding the effect of the acquisitions  march   stockholders equity increased by million from march  results of operations year ended march  compared to year ended march  and year ended march  the company s total gross income increased million or to million in fiscal as compared to million of total gross income in fiscal which in turn increased million or from total gross income of million for fiscal excluding the effects of the acquisitions  fiscal gross income increased by million from fiscal the company s total expenses as a percentage of total gross income increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and fiscal as a result  net income for fiscal increased million or to million compared to net income of million in fiscal excluding the acquisitions during the third quarter of fiscal  net income increased by million from fiscal on a percentage basis  the following table sets forth the composition of the company s results as a percentage of total gross income for the periods indicated years ended march  gross income gain on sale of receivables interest net servicing income other income total gross income expenses compensation and benefits interest provision for loan losses general and administrative total expenses income before income taxes and minority interest income taxes minority interest net income income 
the increase in total gross income was due to a greater volume of loans originated as a result of the expansion of the company s wholesale and broker origination sources 
the following table sets forth information regarding the components of the company s total gross income in each of the last three fiscal years ending on march years ended march  in thousands gain on sale of receivables    interest    net servicing income    other income    total gross income    gain on sale of receivables was the primary component of total gross income  comprising  and of total gross income in fiscal  and  respectively 
gain on sale of receivables increased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal which in turn increased by million or from fiscal excluding million of gain on sale of receivables relating to the acquisitions  the fiscal balance increased by million or from fiscal gain on sale of receivables as a percentage of total gross income was lower in fiscal due to an increased outstanding balance of interest earning assets resulting in increased interest income 
gain on sale of receivables represents income primarily from the structuring and sale of pools of home equity loans originated by contimortgage and strategic alliance clients of the company in remics  owner trusts and grantor trusts 
in addition  gains on sale of receivables are earned upon whole loan sales and upon securitization of commercial and multi family loans  self storage facilities  title i home improvement loans  franchisee loans  auto loans and equipment leases which are sold into remics and whole loan and other trust structures 
the increase in income earned from gain on sale of receivables was due to an increased volume of loans  leases and other assets structured and an increased gain on sale percentage 
excluding contributions from the acquisitions  the company structured and sold billion of mortgages  loans and leases in fiscal  an increase of billion from fiscal  which contributed million of the increase in gain on sale of receivables  and structured and sold billion of mortgages  loans and leases in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal  which contributed million of the increase in gain on sale of receivables 
the gain on sale percentage represents the differential between the interest rate earned on underlying securitized loans  leases or other assets and the pass through rate paid to the securitization investors during the estimated life of the loans  leases or other assets 
the increase in the gain on sale percentage was primarily due to the type of assets securitized and changes in the yield curve 
the larger gain on sale percentage in fiscal as compared to fiscal was partially due to an increased proportion of contimortgage securitizations which yield higher gain on sale percentages than securitizations and placements for strategic alliance clients 
in fiscal  contimortgage securitizations represented of total volume as compared to for fiscal and for fiscal this contributed to a gain of basis points in excess spread or a million increase in gain on sale of receivables in fiscal as compared to fiscal the combination of the million increase due to increased volume and the million increase due to an increase in the percentage of contimortgage assets securitized resulted in a total increase in gain on sale of receivables from fiscal to fiscal of million 
in fiscal as compared to fiscal  the relationship between interest rates and maturity caused an increase in the gain on sale percentage 
as the company originates and sells loans and leases based on the interpolated united states treasury interest rate plus a negotiated additional interest spread  the gain on sale of receivables is affected by unequal movements in interest rates at various maturities 
the interpolated treasury interest rate is based on the company s estimate of the average life of the pool of loans or leases 
in fiscal as compared to fiscal  the yield curve steepened which contributed an additional basis points to excess spread or million of the increase in gain on sale of receivables 
the combination of the million increase due to the yield curve and the million increase due to increased volume resulted in a total increase in gain on sale of receivables from fiscal to fiscal of million 
the gain on sale as a percentage of loans securitized and sold for fiscal  and was  and  respectively 
interest income increased million or in fiscal from fiscal and million or in fiscal from fiscal excluding the effects of the acquisitions  fiscal interest income increased by million  or from fiscal interest income represents interest earned on loans originated or purchased by the company during the period from origination or purchase until the actual sale of the loans  as well as the recognition of the increased value of the discounted excess spread receivables over time 
the interest earned on loans originated and purchased contributed million to the increase between fiscal and fiscal and million to the increase between fiscal and fiscal the increase in interest earned on loans originated and purchased was due primarily to the increase in the average balance of loans originated and purchased but not yet securitized during the periods  an increase of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and an increase of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the recognition of the increased value of the discounted excess spread receivables over time  due to an increase in interest only and residual certificates  as previously discussed  accounted for million of the increase in interest income between fiscal and fiscal and million of the increase between fiscal and fiscal net servicing income increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal and million or in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the increase in the size of the servicing portfolio  the volume of loan sales and securitizations and  in fiscal  a change in accounting principles 
excluding the effects of the acquisitions  fiscal net servicing income increased by million  or from fiscal the company s home equity loan servicing portfolio increased billion or to billion at march  from march  and billion or to billion at march  from march  
the growth of the servicing portfolio contributed million of the increase between fiscal and fiscal  and million of the increase between fiscal and fiscal additionally  net servicing income increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to capitalized servicing income associated with the increase in the contimortgage home equity loan sales and securitizations during the same period 
in fiscal as compared to fiscal the capitalization of servicing fees increased servicing income by million as servicing fees were not capitalized in fiscal other income increased million or to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased million or to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal excluding the effects of the acquisitions  fiscal other income increased by million or from fiscal other income consists primarily of purchase premium refunds and for fiscal  warrant income 
purchase premium refunds are received from certain origination sources related to loans that prepay within a contractually set time period 
upon origination of a loan  the company will pay a wholesale originator a purchase premium for the loan or pools of loans 
the company negotiates agreements with wholesale originators that provide that a portion of such purchase premium will be repaid if individual loans are repaid within a contractually set time period 
the income from purchase premium refunds increased due to the increase in contimortgage origination volume 
the fiscal warrant income received consists of million of income from the sale of stock warrants in a strategic alliance company 
expenses 
total expenses for fiscal increased million or from fiscal which in turn increased million or from fiscal excluding the effects of the acquisitions  fiscal total expenses increased by million or from fiscal these increases in total expenses were due to the increase in number of employees and costs associated with increased mortgage volume and increased interest costs from financing larger balances of securitizable loans 
the following table sets forth the components of the company s expenses for each of the last three fiscal years 
years ended march  in thousands compensation and benefits    interest    provision for loan losses   general and administrative    total expenses    compensation and benefits increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal excluding million of compensation and benefits relating to the acquisitions  fiscal compensation and benefits expense increased by million or from fiscal the increase was primarily due to the addition of new personnel  changes in and accruals under incentive compensation plans  vesting of restricted common stock and commissions paid to certain employees based upon volume of loan originations 
on march   the company had  employees  from the acquisitions  as compared to employees on march  and employees on march  this increase primarily contributed to a million increase in compensation costs in fiscal compared to fiscal  excluding the acquisitions  and a million increase in compensation costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal the fiscal accrual for incentive compensation was million as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal  which contributed to a million decrease in compensation costs in fiscal compared to fiscal and a million increase in fiscal compared to fiscal in connection with the ipo  shares of restricted common stock were granted to certain key employees 
the restricted common stock granted  subject to the employee s continued employment with the company  generally vests between february  and march  the expense related to the vesting of restricted common stock increased by million to million during fiscal from fiscal restricted stock expense of million 
the commissions paid to certain contimortgage employees increased million and million from fiscal to fiscal and fiscal to fiscal  respectively  associated with increased contimortgage origination volume 
compensation and related expenses represents of total gross income for fiscal and and of total gross income for fiscal interest expense increased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal excluding the effects of the acquisitions  fiscal interest expense increased by million or from fiscal this increase was primarily a result of interest expense associated with the issuance of the senior notes  the costs of the sale  with limited recourse  of certain excess spread receivables  increased expenses from the purchase and sale facilities and an overall increase in the cost of borrowing offset by decreased borrowing from continental grain 
the average borrowings from continental grain  purchase and sale facilities  the senior notes and excess spread receivables sold with limited recourse  increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  resulting in a million increase in interest expense  while such average increased million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal resulting in a million increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest rates contributed million to the increase in interest expense between fiscal as compared to fiscal and the increase in interest rates contributed million in fiscal as compared to fiscal provision for loan losses increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal excluding million of provision for loan losses relating to the acquisitions  the fiscal balance increased by million from fiscal provision for loan losses is recorded in sufficient amounts to maintain an allowance at a level considered adequate to cover anticipated losses resulting from liquidation of receivables held for sale and receivables sold with limited recourse under purchase and sale facilities  prior to sale or securitization 
the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal and the decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted from a determination of adequate reserves in light of actual loss experience during the period 
general and administrative expenses increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal and million or in fiscal compared to fiscal excluding million of general and administrative expenses relating to the acquisitions  the fiscal balance increased by million  or from fiscal the increases were partially a result of a million and a million increase in costs associated with underwriting  originating and servicing higher loan volumes in fiscal as compared to fiscal and fiscal as compared to fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  the origination volume increased as compared to fiscal and in fiscal as compared to fiscal expenses related to the implementation of collection technology accounted for approximately million of the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal the remaining increases were primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses related to the increase in the number of employees by  excluding employees of the acquisitions  from fiscal to fiscal and the increase of employees from fiscal to fiscal income taxes 
the company s provision for income taxes was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company is included in the consolidated federal income tax return of continental grain 
the increase in taxes over the three fiscal years is directly related to the increase in income before taxes and minority interest over the same period 
the effective tax rate for each year remained relatively consistent at to 
increases in the effective tax rate were due to changes in the provision for state income taxes 
minority interest 
in fiscal and fiscal  minority interest represents the portion of income before taxes and minority interest due to the minority shareholders of contimortgage 
minority interest decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease in minority interest was directly related to the change in the company s ownership percentage of contimortgage 
on june   contitrade services corporation contitrade services effectively acquired control of the remaining minority interest in contimortgage  which became a wholly owned subsidiary of contifinancial corporation 
accordingly  the fiscal results of operations include approximately three months of minority interest of million  while the comparable period of fiscal reflected months of minority interest of million 
in fiscal  minority interest represents the portion of loss before taxes and minority interest due to the minority shareholders of triad 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company acquired of the common stock of triad 
minority interest was million for the period ended march liquidity and capital resources in a securitization  the company recognizes a gain on the sale of loans or assets securitized upon the closing of the securitization  but does not receive the cash representing such gain until it receives the excess spread  which is payable over the actual life of the loan or other assets securitized 
the company incurs significant expenses in connection with a securitization and incurs both current and deferred tax liabilities as a result of the gain on sale 
therefore  the company requires continued access to short and long term external sources of cash to fund its operations 
the company s primary cash requirements are expected to include the funding of i mortgage  loan and lease originations and purchases pending their pooling and sale  ii the points and expenses paid in connection with the acquisition of wholesale loans  iii fees and expenses incurred in connection with its securitization program  iv over collateralization or reserve account requirements in connection with loans and leases pooled and sold  v ongoing administrative and other operating expenses  vi payments related to its tax obligations under a tax sharing agreement with continental grain or to tax authorities  vii interest and principal payments under the senior notes  viii the costs of the purchase and sale facilities  ix interest payments under the unsecured revolving credit facility  and x the cost of any new acquisitions that the company may pursue 
as a result of its growing securitization program  the company has operated  and expects to continue to operate  on a negative cash flow basis  which is expected to increase as the volume of its loan and asset purchases and originations increases and its securitization program grows 
during fiscal  and  the company securitized and sold in the secondary market billion  billion and billion of loans  respectively 
the company used million  million and million of cash in operations during fiscal  and  respectively 
during the life of the remics  owner trusts or grantor trusts  the company subordinates to the rights of holders of senior interests a portion of the excess spread otherwise due to the company as a credit enhancement to support the sale of senior interests 
the terms of the remics  owner trusts and grantor trusts generally require that the excess spread otherwise payable to the company during the early months of the trusts be used to increase the cash reserve account  or to repay the senior interests in order to increase over collateralization to specified maximums 
the value of such deposit accounts is included in the value of excess spread receivables and the related gain on sale of receivables  net of necessary reserves for credit losses  if applicable 
in addition  increased use of securitization transactions as a funding source by the company has resulted in a significant increase in the amount of gain on sale of receivables recognized by the company 
during fiscal  and  the company recognized gain on sale of receivables in the amounts of million  million  and million  respectively 
the recognition of gain on sale of receivables will have a negative impact on the cash flows of the company to the extent the company is required to pay state and federal income taxes on these amounts in the period recognized  notwithstanding that the company does not receive the cash representing the gain until later periods as the related loans are repaid or otherwise collected 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are sales of loans  leases and other assets through securitization  the sale of loans  leases and other assets under the purchase and sale facilities and trade receivables sold under agreements to repurchase  the sale of excess spread receivables  the sale of the senior notes and the unsecured revolving credit facility 
while the company sells excess spread receivables from time to time  there is no liquid market for such excess spread receivables 
the company had billion of committed sale capacity under its purchase and sale facilities with various financial institutions as of march  the purchase and sale facilities allow the company to sell  with limited recourse  interests in designated pools of loans and other assets 
these agreements generally have one year renewable terms one purchase and sale facility has a two year term  all of which will expire between may and june on march   the company utilized million of the capacity under these facilities 
the company currently anticipates that it will be able to renew these facilities when they expire and to obtain additional facilities 
on march   the company entered into a funding agreement under an agreement to repurchase repurchase agreement 
the repurchase agreement allows the company to sell receivables held for sale to a financial institution under an agreement that the company will repurchase the asset 
this agreement has a one year renewable term which expires january the company currently anticipates that it will be able to renew this facility when it expires and to obtain additional facilities 
the company sells excess spread receivables  with limited recourse  to provide cash to fund the company s securitization program 
these sales aggregated million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal at march   million of these sales were outstanding 
under the recourse provisions of the agreements  the company is responsible for losses incurred by the purchaser within an agreed upon range 
the company s performance obligations in these transactions are guaranteed by continental grain for an agreed upon fee 
although the company intends to continue to pursue opportunities to sell excess spread receivables  no assurance can be given that such opportunities will be available in the future 
in order to fund the company s growth prior to the ipo  continental grain provided the company with intercompany financing intercompany debt 
to refinance the intercompany debt  simultaneously with the completion of the ipo  continental grain purchased from the company a million five year note issued under an indenture the indenture note  a million four year note the four year note and a million term note the term note for million in aggregate collectively  the notes 
on august   the company issued the senior notes maturing august  interest on these notes is payable semiannually on february and august commencing february  the senior notes are redeemable as a whole or in part  at the option of the company  at any time or from time to time  at a redemption price equal to the greater of i of their principal amount and ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at the treasury yield plus basis points  plus in each case  accrued interest to the date of redemption 
proceeds to the company  net of underwriting fees  market discount and other costs were million 
of this amount  million was used by the company to repay in full the term note payable to continental grain and the remaining funds have been used for general corporate purposes  including funding loan originations and purchases  supporting securitization transactions and other working capital needs
