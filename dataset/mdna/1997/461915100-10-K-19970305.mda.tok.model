item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes  which are included elsewhere in this report 
the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  investors bank trust company  provides domestic and global custody  multicurrency accounting  institutional transfer agency  performance measurement  foreign exchange  securities lending and mutual fund administration and investment advisory services to a variety of financial asset managers  including mutual fund complexes  investment advisors  banks and insurance companies 
the company provides financial asset administration services for assets that totaled approximately billion at december   including approximately billion of assets based outside the united states 
the company also engages in private banking transactions  including secured lending and deposit accounts 
the company s historical business and financial results have been significantly influenced by the restrictions imposed under ceba 
under the ceba restrictions  the company could not a engage in any activity in which it was not engaged as of march   b increase its assets by more than during any month period beginning after august   c engage in certain cross marketing activities with affiliates  or d permit overdrafts by or incur overdrafts on behalf of affiliates at a federal reserve bank 
as a result of the offering and the spin off transaction  the company is no longer subject to such restrictions 
accordingly  the company s historical operating results may not necessarily be indicative of either the full scope of the future conduct of the company s business or its future operating results 
the company is now able to expand current business activities and participate in certain additional business activities which may result in increased revenues generated by a possible increase in client deposits and lending opportunities 
the company s clients typically generate cash balances from securities sales and other transactions which they seek to invest on a short term basis 
because the company had been subject to the ceba annual asset growth cap  it was not able to accept those deposits prior to the completion of the spin off transaction and directed them to other financial institutions  foregoing a potential source of revenue 
the company directed client deposits averaging approximately billion daily to other financial institutions in fiscal year since the completion of the spin off transaction and the offering  the company has redirected an average of approximately million daily of these balances into its own deposit products 
similarly  many of the company s clients use credit lines to leverage their portfolios or to handle overnight cash shortfalls 
ceba requirements restricted the company from making commercial loans of this type 
as a result of the removal of ceba limitations  the company is now able to make commercial loans 
additionally  since the spin off transaction  the company has entered into agreements to provide up to an aggregate of million in secured lines of credit to mutual fund clients 
in november  the bank executed agreements with the merrimac master portfolio and the merrimac funds  newly formed master feeder investment companies the funds  pursuant to which the company has agreed to act as investment adviser to the funds 
at the same time  the company engaged the bank of new york to act as sub adviser to manage the investments of the funds 
in addition to acting as adviser to the funds  the bank has entered into agreements to provide custody  fund accounting  administration  transfer agency and certain other related services to the funds 
currently  the funds have one operating master fund  the merrimac cash portfolio  and one operating feeder fund  the merrimac cash fund  with assets totaling over billion at december  the merrimac cash fund offers its shares only to institutions and other accredited investors as that term is defined in rule a under the securities act of and invests all of its assets in the merrimac cash portfolio 
the merrimac cash portfolio invests its assets in high quality money market instruments 
the funds may add additional feeder funds and master funds in the future 
the company s current largest client  eaton vance  accounted for   and of the company s net operating revenues for the years ended october  and  for the transition period  and for the year ended december   respectively 
the company believes its relationship with eaton vance is good and expects it to continue 
the company s agreements with mutual funds managed by eaton vance  pursuant to which the company provides custody and fund accounting services  extend through august and continue thereafter until terminated by either party upon sixty days prior notice 
if a majority of noninterested trustees of a fund determines that the performance of the company under any such agreement has been unsatisfactory or adverse to the interests of the fund s shareholders  or that the terms of the agreement are no longer consistent with publicly available industry standards  the company shall have days after receipt of written notice to such effect to i correct its performance or ii renegotiate such terms 
if such corrective action or renegotiation is not satisfactory to such trustees  such agreement may be terminated on sixty days prior notice 
there have been no requests for corrective action or renegotiation to date pursuant to these contract clauses 
the company derives its revenues from financial asset administration services and private banking transactions 
although interest income and noninterest income are reported separately for financial statement presentation purposes  the company s clients view the pricing of the company s asset administration and banking service offerings on a bundled basis 
in establishing a fee structure for a specific client  management analyzes the expected revenue and related expenses  as opposed to separately analyzing fee income and interest income and related expenses for each from such relationship 
accordingly  management believes net operating revenue net interest income plus noninterest income and net income are meaningful measures of financial results 
noninterest income consists primarily of fees for financial asset administration and is principally derived from custody  multicurrency accounting  transfer agency and administration services for financial asset managers and the assets they control 
the company s clients pay fees based on the volume of assets under custody  the number of securities held and portfolio transactions  income collected and whether other value added services such as foreign exchange  securities lending and performance measurement are needed 
asset based fees are usually charged on a sliding scale 
as such  when the assets in a portfolio under custody grow as a result of changes in market values or cash inflows  the company s fees may be a smaller percentage of those assets 
fees for individually managed accounts  such as custodial  trust and portfolio accounting services for individuals  investment advisors  private trustees  financial planners  other banks and fiduciaries  and other institutions are also included in noninterest income 
net interest income represents the difference between income generated from interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest bearing liabilities are generated by the company s clients who  in the course of their financial asset management  generate cash balances which they deposit on a short term basis with the company 
the company invests these cash balances and remits a portion of the earnings on these investments to its clients 
the company s share of earnings from these investments is viewed as part of the total package of compensation paid to the company from its clients for performing asset administration services 
the company  because it is no longer subject to the ceba balance sheet growth restrictions  is able to accept client deposits it had historically directed to other financial institutions 
as compensation for directing these deposits to other financial institutions  the company had retained a portion of the earnings on the deposits  this amount was recognized as fee income 
generally  the company invests these deposits in various interest earning assets and pays its clients interest expense 
as a result  the mix of fee income and interest income that comprise the total compensation package from clients is shifting as the relative amount of fee income decreases while the relative amount of interest income increases 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
each of these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s future results may be subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
because certain fees charged by the company for its services are based on the market values of assets processed  such fees and the company s quarterly and annual operating results are sensitive to changes in interest rates  declines in stock market values  and investors seeking alternatives to investment offerings of the company s clients 
also  the company s interest related services  along with the market value of the company s investments  may be adversely affected by rapid changes in interest rates 
in addition  many of the company s client engagements are  and in the future are likely to continue to be  terminable upon days notice 
also  a substantial portion of the assets held in the merrimac cash fund are contributed by accounts managed by the fund s sub advisor  the bank of new york 
because the company s fee income from its investment advisory services is based on a percentage of assets invested in the merrimac cash fund  withdrawal from the fund by the accounts managed by the bank of new york could have an adverse affect on the company s revenues 
also  the company relies on certain intellectual property protections to preserve its intellectual property rights 
any invalidation of the company s intellectual property rights or lengthy and expensive defense of those rights could have a material adverse affect on the company 
the segment of the financial services industry in which the company is engaged is extremely competitive 
certain current and potential competitors of the company are more established and benefit from greater market recognition and have substantially greater financial  development and marketing resources than the company 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability  including the timing of the commencement or termination of client engagements  the rate of net inflows and outflows of investor funds in the debt and equity based investment vehicles offered by the company s clients  the introduction and market acceptance of new services by the company and changes or anticipated changes in economic conditions 
because the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  any unanticipated shortfall in revenues in a specified period may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations for that period 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 
statement of operations comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and noninterest income noninterest income increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  noninterest income consists of the following items for the year ended december  change dollars in thousands asset administration fees   proceeds from assignment of uit servicing  net  computer service fees other operating income net loss on sale of securities total noninterest income   asset administration fees increased due principally to higher levels of assets processed 
assets processed is the total dollar value of financial assets on the reported date for which the company provides one or more of the following services custody  multicurrency accounting  institutional transfer agency  performance measurement  foreign exchange  securities lending and mutual fund administration 
total assets processed increased to billion at december  from billion at december  of the billion net increase in assets processed from december  to december   approximately of the increase reflects assets processed for new clients  and the remainder of the increase reflects growth of assets processed for existing clients and improved methods for tracking the amount of assets processed  offset in part by the assets of clients no longer serviced by the company 
the remainder of the growth in asset administration fees was due to the net expansion of relationships with existing clients and increased use of the company s cash management and foreign exchange services 
in addition  because the company is now able to accept deposits that had been historically directed to other financial institutions due to ceba asset growth restrictions  the company has experienced a shift in the mix of compensation received from its clients 
see overview in this item a larger portion of the company s compensation from clients is now in the form of interest income generated from client deposits  resulting in a decrease to asset administration fees and a related increase in net interest income 
the growth in asset administration fees was also offset by the transfer of unit investment trust assets discussed below 
the administration of these assets accounted for approximately  in asset administration fees in the year ended december  unit investment trust uit assets processed by the company have decreased over the last five years  a reflection of declining investor demand for this type of unmanaged investment product 
declining asset levels led one client  merrill  lynch  to consolidate its asset administration service providers  and it agreed  effective march   to pay the company to assign the company s servicing rights to the bank of new york 
the company recognized proceeds of  net of expenses  resulting from the assignment of the rights to service approximately billion of the client s unit investment trust assets

although many of its clients with pooled investment vehicles such as mutual funds use credit lines to leverage their portfolios or to handle overnight cash shortfalls  ceba requirements restricted the company from making commercial loans of this type 
as a result of the removal of ceba limitations due to the spin off transaction  the company may now offer lending services directly to all clients and made its first commercial loan in december virtually all loans to individually managed account customers are written on a demand basis  bear variable interest rates tied to the prime rate and are fully secured by liquid collateral  primarily freely tradeable securities held in custody by the company for the borrower 
since december  the company has entered into agreements to provide up to an aggregate of million under secured lines of credit to mutual fund clients 
loans to mutual funds also include advances by the company to certain mutual fund clients pursuant to the terms of the custody agreements between the company and those clients 
the advances facilitate securities transactions and redemptions involving those mutual funds and are fully secured by liquid collateral  primarily freely tradable securities held in custody by the company for those mutual funds 
at december   the company s only lending concentrations which exceeded of total loans were the revolving lines of credit to mutual fund clients discussed above 
these loans were made in the ordinary course of business on the same terms and conditions prevailing at the time for comparable transactions 
the company also had a lending relationship at december  with landon t 
clay  a principal stockholder of the company and an officer of eaton vance  representing two loans aggregating  in principal amount these loans to mr 
clay were made in the ordinary course of business on the same terms and conditions prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated third parties 
each of these loans was secured with non voting common stock of eaton vance 
the company s credit loss experience has been excellent 
there have been no loan chargeoffs or adverse credit actions in the history of the company 
it is the company s policy to place a loan on non accrual status when either principal or interest becomes days past due and the loan s collateral is not sufficient to cover both principal and accrued interest 
as of december   there were no past due loans  troubled debt restructurings  or any loans on nonaccrual status 
although virtually all of the company s loans are fully collateralized with freely tradeable securities  management recognizes some credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  and has recorded an allowance for loan losses of  at december  this amount is not allocated to any particular loan  but is intended to absorb any risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio 
management actively monitors the loan portfolio and the underlying collateral and regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
as a result of the removal of ceba limitations  the company is now able to make commercial loans such as the credit lines and advances to mutual fund clients discussed above 
the company hopes to increase its lending activities with clients in interest rate sensitivity the company  like all financial intermediaries  is subject to interest rate risk 
rapid changes in interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of the company by causing changes in the market value of the company s assets and its net interest income 
interest rate risk arises when an earning asset matures or when its rate of interest changes in a time frame different from that of the supporting interest bearing liability 
by seeking to minimize the difference between the amounts of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities subject to interest rates changes in the same time frame  the company attempts to reduce the risk of significant adverse effects on net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
the company does not attempt to match each earning asset with a specific interest bearing liability 
instead  as shown in the table below  it aggregates all of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to determine the difference between these in specific time frames 
this difference is known as the rate sensitivity gap 
a positive gap indicates that more earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature in a time frame  and a negative gap indicates the opposite 
maintaining a balanced position will reduce risk associated with interest rate changes  but it will not guarantee a stable interest rate spread because the various rates within a time frame may change by differing amounts and change in different directions 
in addition to structuring the balance sheet to minimize interest rate risk  the company seeks to manage interest rate risk by investment portfolio actions designed to address the interest rate sensitivity of asset cash flows in relation to liability cash flows 
portfolio actions used to manage interest rate risk include managing the effective duration of the portfolio securities and utilizing interest rate contracts 
interest rate contracts are used to hedge against large rate swings and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
it is the company s policy to limit the annual variability in net interest income to plus or minus for a basis point interest rate movement 
the company s simulation model currently projects that a gradual basis point increase in interest rates  over a one year period  would reduce net interest income by 
interest rate contracts involve elements of credit and market risk which are not reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
such instruments are entered into for hedging as opposed to investment or speculative purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company periodically monitors the financial stability of its counterparties according to prudent investment guidelines and established procedures 
there can be no assurance that such portfolio actions will adequately limit interest rate risk

liquidity liquidity represents the ability of an institution to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
for a financial institution such as the company  these obligations arise from the withdrawals of deposits and the payment of operating expenses 
the company s primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  demand loans to individuals  new deposits  federal funds purchased  interest payments on securities held to maturity  fees collected from asset administration clients  and the capital raised from the offering 
asset liquidity is also provided by managing the duration of the investment portfolio 
as a result of the company s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funds  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to meet its depositors needs  to satisfy its operating requirements and to fund the payment of an anticipated annual cash dividend of approximately 
per share 
the company s ability to pay dividends on the common stock and class a common stock depends on the receipt of dividends from investors bank trust company 
in addition  the company may not pay dividends on its common stock or class a common stock if it is in default under certain agreements entered into in connection with the sale of the capital securities described under market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters recent sales of unregistered securities 
any dividend payments by investors bank trust company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the massachusetts commissioner of banks 
subject to regulatory requirements  investors bank trust company expects to pay an annual dividend to the company  which the company expects to pay to its stockholders  currently estimated to be in an amount equal to 
per share of outstanding common stock and class a stock approximately  based upon  shares outstanding as of december

the company has informal borrowing arrangements with various counterparties whereby each counterparty has agreed to make funds available to the company at the federal funds overnight rate 
the aggregate amount of these borrowing arrangements as of december  was million 
each bank may terminate its arrangement at any time and is under no contractual obligation to provide requested funding to the company 
the company s borrowings under these arrangements are typically on an overnight basis 
the company believes that if these banks were unable to provide funding as described above  a satisfactory alternative source of funding would be available to the company 
the company also has master repurchase agreements in place with various counterparties whereby each broker has agreed to make funds available to the company at various rates in exchange for collateral consisting of marketable securities 
the aggregate amount of these borrowing arrangements at december  was million 
the company also has a borrowing arrangement with the federal home loan bank the fhlb whereby the company may borrow amounts determined by prescribed collateral levels and the amount of fhlb stock held by the company 
the minimum amount of fhlb stock held by the company is required to be of its outstanding residential mortgage loans or 
of total assets  whichever is higher 
if the company borrows under this arrangement  the company is required to hold fhlb stock equal to of such outstanding advances 
the aggregate amount of borrowing available to the company under this arrangement at december  was million 
the company s cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities  and financing activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were  for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities  consisting primarily of purchases of investment securities and proceeds from maturities of investment securities  was  for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities  consisting primarily of net activity in deposits  was  for the year ended december  capital resources historically  the company has financed its operations primarily through internally generated cash flows

as a result  the company s capital expenditures for fiscal and were  and  respectively   for the two months ended december   and  for the year ended december  stockholders equity at december  was  an increase of  or  from  at december  the growth in stockholders equity is attributable to current period net income 
the ratio of stockholders equity to assets decreased to at december  from at december  due to the significant growth in assets 
the federal reserve board has adopted a system using internationally consistent risk based capital adequacy guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
under the risk based capital guidelines  different categories of assets are assigned different risk weights  based generally upon the perceived credit risk of the asset 
these risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk weighted asset base 
certain off balance sheet items  which previously were not expressly considered in capital adequacy computations  are added to the risk weighted asset base by converting them to a balance sheet equivalent and assigning them the appropriate risk weight 
federal reserve board and fdic guidelines require that banking organizations have a minimum ratio of total capital to risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items of 
total capital is defined as the sum of tier i and tier ii capital elements  with at least half of the total capital required to be tier i 
tier i capital includes  with certain restrictions  the sum of common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  less certain intangible assets 
tier ii capital includes  with certain limitations  subordinated debt meeting certain requirements  intermediate term preferred stock  certain hybrid capital instruments  certain forms of perpetual preferred stock  as well as maturing capital instruments and general allowances for loan losses 
the following table summarizes the company s tier i and total capital ratios at december  december  amount ratio dollars in thousands tier i capital  tier i capital minimum requirement  excess tier i capital  total capital  total capital minimum requirement  excess total capital  risk adjusted assets  net of intangible assets  in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the federal reserve board and the fdic use a leverage capital ratio as an additional tool to evaluate capital adequacy 
the leverage capital ratio is defined to be a company s tier i capital divided by its adjusted total assets 
the leverage capital ratio adopted by the federal banking agencies requires a ratio of tier i capital to adjusted average total assets for top rated banking institutions 
all other banking institutions will be expected to maintain a leverage capital ratio of to 
the computation of the risk based capital ratios and the leverage capital ratio requires the capital of the company to be reduced by most intangible assets 
the company s leverage capital ratio at december  was  which is in excess of regulatory requirements
