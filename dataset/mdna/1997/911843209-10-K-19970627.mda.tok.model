certain trends and uncertainties the company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements  including statements contained in the company s filings with the united states securities and exchange commission and in its reports to stockholders 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company  any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements 
acquisition strategy 
in pursuit of its strategic objective of becoming the leading global single source provider of water and wastewater treatment systems and services  the company has  since  acquired and successfully integrated more than united states based and international businesses with strong market positions and substantial water and wastewater treatment expertise 
the company plans to continue to pursue acquisitions that complement its technologies  products and services  broaden its customer base and expand its global distribution network 
the company s acquisition strategy entails the potential risks inherent in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent or other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates and in integrating the operations of acquired companies 
although the company generally has been successful in pursuing these acquisitions  there can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will continue to be available  that the company will have access to the capital required to finance potential acquisitions  that the company will continue to acquire businesses or that any business acquired will be integrated successfully or prove profitable 
international transactions 
the company has made and expects it will continue to make acquisitions and expects to obtain contracts in markets outside the united states 
while these activities may provide important opportunities for the company to offer its products and services internationally  they also entail the risks associated with conducting business internationally  including the risk of currency fluctuations  slower payment of invoices  nationalization and possible social  political and economic instability 
reliance on key personnel 
the company s operations are dependent on the continued efforts of senior management  in particular richard j 
heckmann  the company s chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
there are no employment agreements between the company and the members of its senior management  except thierry reyners  the company s executive vice president european group  and harry k 
hornish  jr  the company s executive vice president distribution group 
should any of the senior managers be unable to continue in their present roles  the company s prospects could be adversely affected 
profitability of fixed price contracts 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are generated under fixed price contracts 
to the extent that original cost estimates are inaccurate  costs to complete increase  delivery schedules are delayed or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded  revenue recognition and profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected 
the company routinely records upward or downward adjustments with respect to fixed price contracts due to changes in estimates of costs to complete such contracts 
there can be no assurance that future downward adjustments will not be material 
cyclicality and seasonality 
the sale of capital equipment within the water treatment industry is cyclical and influenced by various economic factors including interest rates and general fluctuations of the business cycle 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are derived from capital equipment sales 
while the company sells capital equipment to customers in diverse industries and in global markets  cyclicality of capital equipment sales and instability of general economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
the sale of water and wastewater distribution equipment and supplies is also cyclical and influenced by various economic factors including interest rates  land development and housing construction industry cycles 
sales of such equipment and supplies are also subject to seasonal fluctuation in northern climates 
as a result of recent acquisitions  the sale of water and wastewater distribution equipment and supplies is a significant component of the company s business 
cyclicality and seasonality of water and wastewater distribution equipment and supplies sales could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
potential environmental risks 
the company s business and products may be significantly influenced by the constantly changing body of environmental laws and regulations  which require that certain environmental standards be met and impose liability for the failure to comply with such standards 
the company is also subject to inherent risks associated with environmental conditions at facilities owned  and the state of compliance with environmental laws  by businesses acquired by the company 
while the company endeavors at each of its facilities to assure compliance with environmental laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that the company s operations or activities  or historical operations by others at the company s locations  will not result in cleanup obligations  civil or criminal enforcement actions or private actions that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in that regard federal and state environmental regulatory authorities have commenced civil enforcement actions related to alleged multiple violations of applicable wastewater pretreatment standards by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company at a connecticut ion exchange regeneration facility acquired by the company in october from anjou international company anjou 
a grand jury investigation is pending which is believed to relate to the same conditions that were the subject of the civil actions 
the company has certain rights of indemnification from anjou which may be available with respect to these matters 
in addition  the company s activities as owner and operator of certain hazardous waste treatment and recovery facilities are subject to stringent laws and regulations and compliance reviews 
failure of these facilities to comply with those regulations could result in substantial fines and the suspension or revocation of the facility s hazardous waste permit 
in other matters  the company has been notified by the united states environmental protection agency that it is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla at certain sites to which the company or its predecessors allegedly sent waste in the past 
it is possible that the company could receive other such notices under cercla or analogous state laws in the future 
the company does not believe that its liability  if any  relating to such matters will be material 
however  there can be no assurance that such matters will not be material 
in addition  to some extent  the liabilities and risks imposed by environmental laws on the company s customers may adversely impact demand for certain of the company s products or services or impose greater liabilities and risks on the company  which could also have an adverse effect on the company s competitive or financial position 
competition 
the water and wastewater treatment industry is fragmented and highly competitive 
the company competes with many united states based and international companies in its global markets 
the principal methods of competition in the markets in which the company competes are technology  prompt availability of local service capability  price  product specifications  customized design  product knowledge and reputation  ability to obtain sufficient performance bonds  timely delivery  the relative ease of system operation and maintenance  and the prompt availability of replacement parts 
in the municipal contract bid process  pricing and ability to meet bid specifications are the primary considerations 
while no competitor is considered dominant  there are competitors which have significantly greater resources than the company  which among other things  could be a competitive disadvantage to the company in securing certain projects 
technological and regulatory change 
the water and wastewater treatment business is characterized by changing technology  competitively imposed process standards and regulatory requirements  each of which influences the demand for the company s products and processes obsolete 
acceptance of new products may also be affected by the adoption of new government regulations requiring stricter standards 
the company s ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to develop successfully and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in the company s ability to grow and to remain competitive 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for it to remain competitive or that certain of its products will not become obsolete 
in addition  the company is subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications  including lack of market acceptance  delays in development or failure of products to operate properly 
municipal and wastewater market 
completion of certain of the company s acquisitions has increased significantly the percentage of the company s revenues derived from municipal customers 
while municipalities represent an important market in the water and wastewater treatment industry  contractor selection processes and funding for projects in the municipal sector entail certain additional risks not typically encountered with industrial customers 
competition for selection of a municipal contractor typically occurs through a formal bidding process which can require the commitment of significant resources and greater lead times than industrial projects 
in addition  demand in the municipal market is dependent upon the availability of funding at the local level  which may be the subject of increasing pressure as local governments are expected to bear a greater share of the cost of public services 
zimpro is party to certain agreements entered into in at the time zimpro was acquired from unrelated third parties by the entities from which it was later acquired by the company  pursuant to which zimpro agreed  among other things  to pay the original sellers a royalty of of its annual consolidated net sales of certain products in excess of million through october  under certain interpretations of such agreements  with which the company disagrees  zimpro could be liable for such royalties with respect to the net sales attributable to products  systems and services of certain defined wastewater treatment businesses acquired by zimpro or the company or the company s other subsidiaries after may  the defined businesses include  among others  manufacturing machinery and equipment  and engineering installation  operation and maintenance services related thereto  for the treatment and disposal of waste liquids  toxic waste and sludge 
one of the prior sellers has revealed in a letter to the company an interpretation that may be contrary to that of the company 
the company believes that it would have meritorious defenses to any claim based upon any such interpretation and would vigorously pursue the elimination of any threat to expand what it believes to be its obligations pursuant to such agreements 
impact of recently issued accounting standards 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued a new statement titled earnings per share 
the new statement is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company does not believe that adoption of this new standard will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements
