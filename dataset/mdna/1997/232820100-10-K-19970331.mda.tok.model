the company has a interest in each of five unconsolidated associated companies with aggregate net sales of in  in and in  of which approximately were sales of specialty chemicals in and in and and approximately were sales of specialty materials in and in and year ended december   compared with year ended december  net sales for were  which was essentially flat in comparison with net sales of  the company s specialty product lines grew principally on higher volumes 
building block chemical net sales decreased as a result of lower selling prices and selling volumes in certain products 
international net sales grew to of total net sales in from of total net sales in on a regional basis  sales in the united states declined primarily due to decreased methanol sales as a result of lower selling prices and volumes plus the effect of divested products in earnings from operations were up significantly in the united states as a result of cost reduction programs and an improved product mix 
also included in results for the region were startup costs associated with the expanded acrylonitrile facility 
sales and earnings from operations in the asia pacific region were down principally due to lower export acrylic fiber and acrylonitrile selling prices 
specialty chemicals net sales increased  or  with the increase spread among all regions of the world 
also affecting net sales in was the effect of divesting certain minor product lines  which had a negative impact on the year to year comparison in net sales

selling prices for acrylic fibers were down with the bulk of the price decrease coming from export sales 
building block chemical net sales decreased  or  primarily due to acrylonitrile and methanol 
acrylonitrile volume was up due to the expanded plant being in service for a full year  but this was more than offset by lower selling prices 
methanol sales decreased as a result of lower selling prices in the first half of in addition  methanol volumes were down in the first half of as a result of production downtime due to repairs as well as a shutdown in january due to poor economic conditions caused by low selling prices coupled with high natural gas costs

us net sales of specialty chemicals increased  or 
us net sales increases in the first half of were offset in part by decreases in the second half of as a result of what management believes to be a correction for high inventory levels by certain customers and a slower growth rate in the us economy

building block chemicals net sales increased  or 
methanol sales accounted for of the increase  since the methanol plant was still under construction until september partially offsetting the higher sales volume were methanol selling prices that were much lower than during the fourth quarter of and unscheduled maintenance downtime in the methanol manufacturing facility in the third quarter of acrylonitrile sales increased due to additional capacity available from the expanded acrylonitrile manufacturing plant  which started up in the second quarter of in addition  acrylonitrile selling prices were well above the prior year 
partially offsetting the higher acrylonitrile sales was unscheduled maintenance downtime in the acrylonitrile manufacturing facility in the third quarter of acrylamide sales also increased over the prior year period  principally in the united states and europe 
manufacturing cost of sales improved to of net sales in as compared with of net sales for much of the improvement was due to manufacturing cost efficiencies as costs  excluding raw materials and utilities  increased at a much lower rate than the growth in net sales

equity in net earnings of associated companies for increased from increased earnings were recorded by cyro industries as a result of higher selling prices and increased sales of methyl methacrylate monomer due to a plant expansion 
earnings from criterion catalyst company also improved due to higher selling volume  particularly of new and improved products 
these increases were partially offset by losses from mitsui cytec due to expenses associated with the start up of a new resins manufacturing facility and the shutdown of an existing resins facility 
dividends on preferred stock were lower than the prior year period due to the repurchase of all of the series a stock and series b stock 
the reduced dividends  offset in part by lower interest income and higher interest expense from these transactions as well as the reduced fully diluted common shares outstanding  had a positive impact of approximately for the full year on fully diluted earnings per common share 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and financial condition 
net earnings available for common stockholders reflected a reduction recorded in the fourth quarter of upon the completion of the repurchase of the series b stock 
the represented the excess of the repurchase price of the series a stock and series b stock over the related book value 
liquidity and financial condition at december   the company s cash balance was  an increase of from year end net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled for the year ended december   compared with in the same period of cash was favorably impacted on by increased net earnings  after adjusting for the partial reversal of the tax valuation allowance in  and improved accounts receivable due to lower days outstanding 
inventory levels increased primarily in the international regions as the company expanded its presence outside of the united states 
other liabilities decreased primarily as a result of increased environmental spending in as more projects reached the remediation phase of activity 
environmental remediation spending for the years ended december   and  was   and  respectively 
there can be no assurances that the company s annual cash expenditures will not be higher in the future 
while it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending environmental suits and claims  it is reasonably possible that there will be a necessity for future provisions for environmental costs which  in management s opinion  will not have a material effect on the financial position of the company  but could be material to the results of operations of the company in any one accounting period 
the company cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amount
