at the partnership level  revenues for decreased due to a decrease in lease revenues from holiday inn  which was mostly offset by a increase in garage lease revenues 
the decline in hotel revenues was partially attributable to the rehabilitation project  which caused a percentage of the guest rooms to be out of service during the year 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flows are primarily generated by its subsidiary s investment in the justice investors limited partnership  which derives the majority of its income from a lease with holiday inn and a lease with evon garage corporation 
in addition to its monthly limited partnership distributions from justice investors  portsmouth receives monthly management fees as a general partner 
the company also derives revenue from the investment of its cash and securities assets 
rehabilitation of the hotel property continued during with remodeling and upgrading of all the guest rooms and hallways on the room floors having been completed by july all of the regulatory work relating to the life and safety systems was also completed during upgrading and renovation of the lobby  meeting rooms  common areas and elevators is expected to be completed during the hotel rehabilitation budget is approximately million  of which the partnership is obligated for million 
as of december   the partnership had paid approximately million against its million commitment 
the partnership s hotel property is subject to a first deed of trust securing a loan from wells fargo bank 
the loan provides for a maximum borrowing million and has the characteristics of a line of credit with certain maximum borrowings available at the end of each year 
the major portion of the debt is carried at libor plus and there is a monthly adjustment to that rate 
the remainder of the debt is carried at the prime rate and also adjusted monthly 
during  the partnership was able to reduce the principal balance on the wells fargo notes from  as of december  to  as of december  this principal reduction of  was able to be achieved at the same time the partnership was making additional payments of approximately million toward the rehabilitation of the hotel primarily due to increased cash flows generated from the hotel and garage leases and low interest rates

the company s securities investments are classified as available for sale and unrealized gains and losses  net of deferred taxes  are included in shareholders equity 
as of december   the company had a net unrealized gain on investments of  after tax  which consists of pre tax unrealized gains of  and pre tax unrealized losses of realized investment gains and losses may fluctuate significantly from period to period in the future and could have a meaningful effect on the company s net earnings 
however  the amount of realized investment gain or loss for any given period may have no predictive value  and variations in amount from period to period may have no practical analytical value 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cash flow to the partnership remains dependent on the operating results of the hotel and garage leases and interest rates 
with an increased role in the monitoring of the operations of the hotel and parking garage by the company  and with the renovation of the guest rooms having been completed  it is anticipated that revenues to the partnership will continue to increase 
as a result of increases in the amount of rental income from the hotel lease  the general partners of justice investors decided that there would be a special one third increase in the monthly distribution to limited partners effective with the february distribution 
as a result of that action  the partnership s monthly distribution to portsmouth will increase to  from  although it is planned that the distribution at the higher level will continue for a period of months  the increase was clearly identified as a special distribution and  at any time  unforeseen circumstances could dictate a change in the amount distributed 
the general partners will conduct an annual review and analysis to determine an appropriate monthly distribution for the ensuing year 
at that time  the monthly distribution could be decreased or increased

impact of inflation since the company s primary source of revenue is from its subsidiary s partnership investment in justice investors  the impact of inflation on santa fe should be viewed at the partnership level 
as discussed above  partnership income is dependent on lease revenue from holiday inn 
to the extent that holiday adjusts room rates to meet operating costs and market conditions  there may be a minor impact on partnership revenues due to inflation 
partnership revenues are also subject to interest rate risks which may be influenced by inflation 
for the three most recent fiscal years  the impact of inflation on the company s income is not viewed by management as material
