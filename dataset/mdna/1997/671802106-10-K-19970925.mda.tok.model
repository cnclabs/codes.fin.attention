the company designs  develops and markets high performance integrated semiconductors and related software to original equipment manufacturers worldwide that serve the pc  consumer electronics and digital office equipment markets 
the company provides semiconductor products for these markets by leveraging its expertise in five core technologies optical storage  mpeg imaging  video graphics  audio communications and digital imaging 
the company s products typically consist of hardware  firmware and software to provide a complete solution for customers 
the company contracts with independent foundries to manufacture all of its products  enabling the company to focus on its design strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing facilities 
except as described in the paragraphs below  the foundries generally are not obligated to supply products to the company for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at a specific price 
in june and november  the company entered into agreements with tsmc and chartered to obtain certain additional wafer capacity through the year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the agreements call for the company to commit to certain future wafer purchases and to deposit funds with the suppliers as either a portion of the price of the additional wafers in advance of their delivery or as a non interest bearing deposit to secure the availability of additional wafers 
the price of such wafers will be determined in the future periods in which specific orders are actually placed 
if the company is not able to use  assign  or sell the additional wafer quantities  all or a portion of the deposits may be forfeited 
in october  the company amended its previous agreement with tsmc resulting in a reduction of approximately million of the company s future wafer purchases required under the original agreement 
under the amended agreement  no additional prepayment is required  however  the company must utilize the entire amount of the prepayment paid to date through a certain committed amount of wafer purchases in the years   and or the prepayment will be forfeited 
in september and april  the company amended its agreement with chartered 
the amendments resulted in a reduction of the company s future wafer purchase commitments and the elimination of required future cash deposits under the original agreement of approximately million 
under the amended agreement  the required future cash deposits of approximately million could be reinstated if certain conditions are not met 
the company currently believes the terms and conditions of the agreement as amended will be met and that these commitments will not be reinstated although no assurance can be given in this regard 
the company recorded million in cost of sales during fiscal associated with manufacturing cost adjustments related to its wafer foundry agreements as a result of lower forecasted capacity usage during the calendar year ending december  the execution of these amendments reduced the company s wafer purchase commitments during the remainder of calendar and thereafter and resulted in a favorable manufacturing cost adjustment recorded to cost of revenues of million during each of the quarters ended december  and september  based on an estimate of the wafers purchased during those quarters 
the remaining deposits and prepayments under the amended foundry agreements described above are recorded at cost and total approximately million as of june  the company currently anticipates being able to utilize and fully recover the value of all foundry prepayments and deposits under the terms of the amended agreements 
the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  declining asps and rapid product obsolescence 
in addition  a limited number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the company s net revenues 
in fiscal  and  sales to the company s top ten customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company is also heavily dependent on the market for cd rom controller products 
in fiscal  and  the company s cd rom controller products accounted for  and  respectively  of net revenues 
the company expects that  for the foreseeable future  its cd rom controller products will account for a substantial majority of its net revenues 
any decrease in the demand for such products or the loss of one or more key customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  in fiscal  and   and  respectively  of net revenues were derived from international sales 
a substantial portion of the company s international revenues in fiscal  and were derived from japanese  taiwanese  korean and singapore manufacturers of cd rom drives 
the company s international sales are subject to a number of risks  including the effect of currency fluctuations  state imposed restrictions on repatriation of funds and import and export duties and restrictions 
there can be no assurance that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues 
the company s net revenues in the comparison periods were primarily derived from product sales 
net revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the unit sales and average selling prices of cd rom controllers in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in unit sales resulted from the company receiving substantially fewer orders for its cd rom controller products in fiscal than in fiscal the company believes the decline in orders is primarily attributable to a change in the ordering patterns of cd rom drive manufacturers and the continued maturation of the cd rom industry 
see factors that may affect future results below 
international sales  principally to japan  taiwan  korea and singapore accounted for approximately and of the company s net revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sales of the company s cd rom controller products accounted for and of net revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company expects that international sales of its cd rom controller products will continue to represent a substantial majority of its net revenues for the foreseeable future 
included in net revenues for fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively of nonrefundable technology license fees 
gross margin 
cost of revenues includes the cost of wafer fabrication  assembly and testing performed by third party vendors and direct and indirect costs associated with the procurement  scheduling and quality assurance functions performed by the company 
the company s gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase in gross margin is primarily the result of adjustments of approximately million to cost of revenues associated with the sale of products which had been fully reserved in prior periods as well as manufacturing cost adjustments of million related to foundry agreements 
additionally  fiscal gross margins were reduced as a result of inventory related charges to cost of sales of million 
excluding the impact of these adjustments  gross margin for fiscal and would have been approximately and  respectively 
this adjusted gross margin decreased from the comparable period in fiscal primarily as a result of a decrease in asps of the company s cd rom controller products that was not offset by a comparable decrease in product costs 
the company s overall gross margin is subject to change due to various factors  including  among others  competitive product pricing  yields  wafer costs  assembly and test costs and product mix 
the company expects that asps for its existing products will continue to decline over time and that asps for each new product will decline significantly over the life of the product 
a decline in asps that is not offset by a reduction in production costs or by sales of new products with higher gross margins would decrease the company s overall gross margin and could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  the company believes that gross margins for new products will be lower than historical levels and that  as a result  gross margins in general will decline in the future 
research and development expenses 
research and development costs are all expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was principally the result of the hiring of additional personnel and associated expenses 
research and development expenses increased as a percentage of net revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to the decrease in the company s net revenues 
the company will continue to invest substantial resources in research and development  including hiring additional technical personnel  in an effort to maintain its technological leadership in the cd rom controller market and to diversify its product development in its other core technologies video graphics  mpeg imaging  audio communications  and digital imaging 
as a result  the company expects to incur higher research and development expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of the hiring of additional personnel and associated expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal  due primarily to the decrease in the company s net revenues 
as a result of continuing efforts to develop the company s infrastructure and hire additional senior management personnel  the company expects to incur higher administrative expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal acquisition related charges 
in november  the company acquired pixel magic  a privately held company based in andover  massachusetts for million in cash  of which million was contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria over a three year period 
approximately million of the initial cash payment was allocated to in process research and development and was charged to operations in fiscal in june  the company waived certain of the performance criteria and agreed to pay the contingent amount of million in two installments during calendar the first payment of million is due in january and the second payment of million is due in december as a result of this agreement and because the contingent earnout was based  in part  on the continued employment of the former shareholder employees of pixel magic  inc  the company recorded a compensation charge of million in the quarter ended june  nonoperating income  net 
nonoperating income  net consisted primarily of net interest income in fiscal nonoperating income  net was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease is primarily the result of lower net interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the lower tax rate in was primarily attributable to the effect of the reinstated research and development tax credit on fiscal results as well as a geographical shift in the sources of taxable income in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues 
the company s net revenues in the comparison periods were primarily derived from product sales 
net revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to growth in unit sales of cd rom controllers 
international sales  principally to japan  singapore and taiwan  accounted for approximately and of the company s net revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sales of the company s cd rom controller products accounted for and of net revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
included in net revenues for fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively of nonrefundable technology license fees 
gross margin 
cost of revenues includes the cost of wafer fabrication  assembly and testing performed by third party vendors and direct and indirect costs associated with the procurement  scheduling and quality assurance functions performed by the company 
the company s gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease in gross margin is primarily the result of inventory related charges to cost of sales of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by an increase in margin from cd rom controller sales during fiscal in both fiscal and  the company s gross margin was also favorably affected by nonrefundable technology license fee revenues  which had no associated cost of revenues 
the company s overall gross margin is subject to change due to various factors  including  among others  competitive product pricing  yields  wafer costs  assembly and test costs and product mix 
research and development expenses 
research and development costs are all expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was principally the result of the hiring of additional personnel and associated expenses 
research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to rapid growth in the company s net revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of the hiring of additional personnel and associated expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal  due primarily to rapid growth in the company s net revenues 
acquisition related charges 
in november  the company acquired pixel magic  a privately held company based in andover  massachusetts for million in cash  of which million was paid up front and million was contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria over a three year period 
approximately million of the initial cash payment was allocated to in process research and development and was charged to operations in fiscal nonoperating income  net 
nonoperating income  net consisted primarily of net interest income in fiscal nonoperating income  net was million in fiscal and million in fiscal income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the higher tax rate in was primarily attributable to an increase in income before tax in fiscal and the full utilization of the company s federal net operating loss carryforwards by the middle of fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including the gain or loss of significant customers  increased competitive pressures  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors and market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s and its customers products 
other factors include the availability of foundry capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  availability and cost of raw materials  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry  the market for pcs and the markets addressed by the company s products  seasonal customer demand  the company s ability to diversify its product offerings  the competitiveness of the company s customers  the timing of significant orders  significant increases in expenses associated with the expansion of operations and development of the company s support infrastructure  and changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers  including decreases in asps of the company s products 
in addition  the company s quarterly operating results could be materially adversely affected by legal expenses incurred in connection with  or any adverse judgment in  the company s ongoing shareholder legal proceedings 
the company s operating results could also be adversely affected by economic conditions generally in various geographic areas where the company or its customers do business  or by order cancellations or rescheduling 
these factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors could materially affect the company s quarterly or annual operating results 
there can be no assurance as to the level of sales or earnings that may be attained by the company in any given period in the future 
the company currently places noncancelable orders to purchase its products from independent foundries on an approximately three month rolling basis and is currently committed with two of its foundries for certain minimum amounts of capacity for the next several years  while its customers generally place purchase orders with the company less than four weeks prior to delivery that may be rescheduled or under certain circumstances may be canceled without significant penalty 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter are rescheduled  canceled  or do not occur as quickly as expected  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for that quarter or for the year would be materially adversely affected 
the semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  significant price erosion  periods of over capacity and production shortages  variations in manufacturing costs and yields and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
in addition  the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of product prices 
the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions 
the company and various of its current and former officers and directors are parties to certain legal proceedings 
see legal proceedings 
all of these actions are in the early stages of proceedings and the company is currently investigating the allegations 
based on its current information  the company believes the suits to be without merit and will defend its position vigorously 
no provision for any liability that may result upon adjudication has been made in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in connection with these legal proceedings  the company has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  substantial legal and other expenses 
shareholder suits of this kind are highly complex and can extend for a protracted period of time  which can substantially increase the cost of such litigation and divert the attention of the company s management 
the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  declining unit asp s and rapid product obsolescence 
the company expects competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter the company s existing or future markets with solutions that may be less costly or provide higher performance or additional features 
the company s existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than the company 
the company s competitors also include a number of emerging companies as well as some of the company s own customers and suppliers 
the company is currently attempting to enter several new markets in which the company has not previously operated 
these markets are intensely competitive and the company will have to compete with large domestic and international companies that have long standing relationships with the company s target customers 
certain of the company s principal competitors maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from certain capacity  cost and technological advantages 
the company believes that its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  both within and outside of its control  including the price  quality and performance of the company s and its customers products  the timing and success of new product introductions by the company  its customers and its competitors  the emergence of new pc standards  the development of technical innovations  the ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity and sources of raw materials  the efficiency of production  the rate at which the company s customers design the company s products into their products  the market acceptance of the products of the company s customers  the number and nature of the company s competitors in a given market  the assertion of intellectual property rights and general market and economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
the willingness of prospective customers to design the company s products into their products depends to a significant extent upon the ability of the company to have product available at the appropriate market window and to price its products at a level that is cost effective for such customers 
the markets for most of the applications for the company s products  particularly the pc market and the consumer electronics market  are characterized by intense price competition 
as the markets for the company s products mature and competition increases  the company anticipates that asps on its products will decline 
if the company is unable to reduce its costs sufficiently to offset declines in asps or is unable to successfully introduce new higher performance products with higher asps  the company s operating results will be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if the company experiences yield or other production problems or shortages of supply that increase its manufacturing costs  or fails to reduce its manufacturing costs  the result would be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by evolving industry standards  rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
the company s performance is highly dependent upon the successful development and timely introduction of new products at competitive price and performance levels 
currently  the company s financial performance is dependent upon the company s level of success in the cd rom controller market 
in an effort to diversify its product and market base  the company has invested substantial resources in optical storage as well as in its other core technologies video graphics  mpeg imaging  audio communications  and digital imaging 
there can be no assurance that products currently under development in these core technologies or any other new products will be successfully developed or will achieve market acceptance  thereby affecting the company s ability to achieve diversification of its product and market bases 
the failure of the company to introduce new products successfully or the failure of new products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on several factors  including recognition of market requirements  product cost  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  securing sufficient foundry capacity for volume manufacturing of wafers  quality of new products and achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields from the company s contract manufacturers 
due to the design complexity of its products  the company has experienced delays in completing development and introduction of new products  and there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter such delays in the development and introduction of future products 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner  that the company s products will be selected for design into the products of its targeted customers or that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
the failure of the company s new product development efforts or the failure of the company to achieve market acceptance of its new products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company s ability to compete is affected by its ability to protect its proprietary information 
the company considers its technology to be proprietary and relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company currently has three patents granted  fourteen patents pending  seventeen patents in preparation in the united states  and two international patents pending 
the company intends to seek additional international patents and additional united states patents on its technology 
there can be no assurance that additional patents will issue from any of the company s pending applications or applications in preparation  or be issued in all countries where the company s products can be sold  or that any claims allowed from pending applications or applications in preparation will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the company 
additionally  competitors of the company may be able to design around the company s patents 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
in fiscal  the company filed a complaint with the international trade commission itc against certain asian manufacturers of optical storage controller devices based on the company s belief that such devices infringed one or more of the company s patents 
the complaint seeks a ban on the importation into the united states of any infringing cd rom controller or products containing such infringing cd rom controllers 
see legal proceedings 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which has resulted in significant  often protracted and expensive litigation 
although there is currently no pending intellectual property litigation against the company  the company or its foundries may from time to time be notified of claims that the company may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
if it is necessary or desirable  the company may seek licenses under such patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  there can be no assurance that licenses will be offered or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to the company 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by the company could cause the company to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of products or the use by the company s foundries of processes requiring the technology 
furthermore  the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of the company s proprietary rights or to establish the validity of the company s proprietary rights 
the company recently initiated such litigation by filing a complaint with the international trade commission 
litigation by or against the company could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a favorable determination for the company 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in such development or that such licenses would be available on reasonable terms  or at all  and any such development or license could require expenditures by the company of substantial time and other resources 
patent disputes in the semiconductor industry have often been settled through cross licensing arrangements 
because the company has a limited portfolio of patents  the company may not be able to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
if a successful claim is made against the company  or its customers  and a license is not made available to the company on commercially reasonable terms  or if the company is required to pay substantial damages or awards  the company s business  financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
the company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and confidentiality and license agreements with its customers and potential customers  and limits access to and distribution of the source and object code of its software and other proprietary information 
under some circumstances  the company grants licenses that give its customers limited access to the source code of the company s software which increases the likelihood of misappropriation or misuse of the company s technology 
accordingly  despite precautions taken by the company  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s technology or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or to provide an adequate remedy in the event of a breach or misappropriation by others 
certain technology used in the company s products is licensed from third parties 
some of the company s products  particularly those targeted for the dvd market  require certain types of copy protection software that the company must license from third parties 
there can be no assurance that such licenses  or licenses of other third party technology  will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
the inability of the company to enter into such license arrangements on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company contracts with independent foundries to manufacture all of its products  enabling the company to focus on its design strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing facilities 
certain of the company s foundry agreements require up front  nonrefundable prepayments or deposits and these fixed costs could affect the company s operating margins if the company is unable to utilize the minimum number of wafers required under the agreements 
the company is dependent on its foundries to allocate to the company a portion of their foundry capacity sufficient to meet the company s needs to produce products of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver products to the company in a timely manner 
these foundries fabricate products for other companies and some manufacture products of their own design 
the company has recently experienced a decrease in the supply of available foundry capacity which in turn has created an increase in the lead time required to manufacture the company s products 
if the company is unsuccessful in getting its customers to place orders on a longer lead time  the company may be unable to fulfill customer demand 
the loss of any of these foundries as a supplier  the inability of the company in a period of increased demand for its products to expand the foundry capacity of its current suppliers or qualify other wafer manufacturers for additional foundry capacity  any inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from the company s current or future suppliers or any other circumstances that would require the company to seek alternative sources of supply could delay shipments of the company s products  which could damage relationships with its current and prospective customers  provide an advantage to the company s competitors and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company s reliance on independent manufacturers and third party assembly and testing vendors involves a number of additional risks  including the unavailability of  or interruption in access to  certain process technologies and reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
in addition  as a result of the company s dependence on foreign subcontractors  the company is subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including foreign government regulation and general political risks  such as political and economic instability  potential hostilities  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions  and other barriers and restrictions  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors beyond the company s control 
the manufacture of semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process 
minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  difficulties in the fabrication process or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or a significant number of die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
many of these problems are difficult to diagnose and time consuming or expensive to remedy 
the company s products are particularly complex and difficult to manufacture 
there can be no assurance that the company s foundries will not experience irregularities or adverse yield fluctuations in their manufacturing processes 
any yield or other production problems or shortages of supply experienced by the company or its foundries could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales of the company s cd rom controller products comprised  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales of cd rom controller products are expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s total revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company expects that as the market for cd rom controller products matures or becomes obsolete due to the introduction of dvd rom products  sales of such products will decline 
although the company is currently pursuing the development of optical storage semiconductors for use in dvd rom drives  there can be no assurance that the company will have a dvd rom product  that such product will be available within an acceptable market window  or that such product will be able to sustain the current level of optical storage product sales 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the market for cd rom controller products in general  or the company s cd rom controller products in particular  will support the company s planned operations in the future 
any decrease in the overall level of sales of  or the prices for  the company s cd rom controller products  due to introductions of products by present or future competitors  a decline in demand for cd rom controller products  product obsolescence or any other reason would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company has recently introduced several new products in its attempt to diversify its product and market base  there can be no assurance that these products will be successfully designed in and brought to production or that the company s customer s products will be accepted in the marketplace 
during fiscal  and   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues were derived from international sales 
a substantial portion of the company s international revenues in fiscal  and were derived from japanese  taiwanese  korean and singapore manufacturers of cd rom drives 
accordingly  the company is subject to the risks of conducting business outside of the united states 
these risks include unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse taxes  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors beyond the company s control 
the company is also subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with its international operations  such as political  social and economic instability  potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not adversely affect the company s operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
most of the company s foreign sales are negotiated in us dollars  however  invoicing is often done in local currency 
as a result  the company may be subject to the risks of currency fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that one or more of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or operating results or require the company to modify its current business practices 
a limited number of customers historically has accounted for a substantial portion of the company s net revenues 
in fiscal  and  sales to the company s top ten customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
these customers were all purchasers of the company s cd rom product 
in fiscal  mitsumi accounted for and lg electronics accounted for 
in fiscal  mitsumi accounted for  kanematsu accounted for and nec accounted for of the company s net revenues 
kanematsu  a japanese trading company  purchases product from the company and resells the product to japanese manufacturers 
in fiscal  mitsumi accounted for and kanematsu accounted for of the company s net revenues 
although the company is currently attempting to diversify its products  markets  and customer base  the company expects that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of its net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company has experienced significant changes from year to year in the composition of its major customer base and believes this pattern will continue 
for example  mitsumi has only been a significant customer of the company since fiscal the company does not have long term purchase agreements with any of its customers 
customers generally purchase the company s products pursuant to short term purchase orders 
the loss of  or significant reduction in purchases by  current major customers such as mitsumi or lg electronics would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
there can be no assurances that the company s current customers will continue to place orders or that existing orders will not be canceled 
if sales to current customers cease or are reduced  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain the orders from new customers necessary to offset any such losses or reductions 
the company s future performance depends  to a significant degree  on the continued retention and contribution of members of the company s senior management as well as other key personnel 
the company is in the process of recruiting additional senior managers and technical personnel 
competition for these persons is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain qualified senior managers and technical personnel 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its cash requirements from cash generated from operations  the sale of equity securities  bank lines of credit and long term and short term debt
