valuation of accounts receivable the company values its uncollected accounts receivable as part of its determination of profit 
the company constantly reviews the accounts receivable valuation

healthcare system the healthcare system is in a state of change and will continue so for the next several years 
small medical group practices are referring patients to free standing centers as an alternative to costly hospital care 
the cost of this medical equipment and the patient volume needed to justify the expenditure is not practical for individual and small group practices 
providing mri and ct scans for these physicians in these free standing centers offers an attractive method to protect eroding income  offer state of the art technology and maintain patient loyalty 
legislation legislation has been passed in some states that will restrict the physicians in joining joint ventures such as those of the company 
in new jersey  any site already in existence has been excluded from this legislation 
this legislation was enacted in july federal guidelines also known as safe harbor guidelines have been established that will limit physicians to the number of medicare patients they can refer to an outpatient facility in which they have a financial interest 
a commission has been appointed by the federal government to review the delivery of healthcare on a national level 
although many alternatives have been discussed  it is impossible to determine at this time what charges will be enacted or the affect on the company s business 
in order to curb the potential for fraud and abuse under the medicare and medicaid programs  congress has enacted certain laws the anti kickback laws prohibiting the payment or receipt any remuneration in return for the referral of patients to a healthcare provider for the furnishing of medical services of equipment  the payment for which may be made in whole or in part by the medicare or medicaid programs 
it should be noted that the anti kickback laws apply to both sides of the referral relationship the provider making the referral and the provider receiving the referral 
violation of the anti kickback laws is a criminal felony punishable by fines up to  and or up to five years imprisonment for each violation 
federal law also permits the department of health and human services hhs to assess civil fines against violators of the anti kickback laws and to exclude them from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
these civil sanctions can be imposed in proceedings that do not involve the same procedural requirements and standards of proof as would be required in a criminal trial 
even though the joint ventures have physician investors  the anti kickback laws will not have an effect on the company s operations because the company does not bill medicare and medicaid for medical services as it only leases equipment 
legislation continued hhs has proposed regulations specifying safe harbors for various payment practices between healthcare providers and their referral sources 
if a payment practice were to come within the safe harbor  it would not be treated as an illegal medicare medicaid kickback which is a ground for exclusion from the medicare medicaid programs 
while failure to fall within a safe harbor does not mean that the practice is illegal  hhs had indicated that it may give such arrangements closer scrutiny 
in their present proposed form  no safe harbor would cover an investment interest in the company 
it is likely that this bill will be reintroduced in future sessions 
the company cannot predict whether these regulatory or statutory provisions will be enacted by federal or state authorities which would prohibit or otherwise regulate referrals by physicians to the company thereby having a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the stark bill extends the prohibition against physician self referral  which had previously been applicable only to clinical laboratory services  to several additional services  but also sets forth several exceptions to the ban  which the following outlines in general  the stark bill provides that a physician with an ownership or investment interest in or a compensation agreement with an entity is prohibited from making referrals to that entity for the furnishing of designated health services for which medicare  payment would otherwise be made 
designated health services under the stark bill include clinical laboratory services  physical therapy services  occupational therapy services  radiology or other diagnostic services  radiology therapy services  the furnishing of durable medical equipment  parental and enteral nutrients  equipment and supplies  prosthetics  orthotics and prosthetic devices home health services  outpatient prescription drugs  and inpatient and outpatient hospital services 
this bill is effective for referrals made on or after january   for clinical laboratory services  and effective for referrals made after december   in the case of other designated health services 
while this bill has not affected the company at this time  it may have an adverse effect limiting medicare and medicaid referrals by physicians who are investors in the joint venture 
in  new jersey enacted the health care cost reduction act  or so called codey bill  njsa et seq 
which provided in part that a medical practitioner shall not refer a patient  or direct one of its employees to refer a patient  to a health care service in which the practitioner and or the practitioner s immediate family had any beneficial interest 
the bill specifically provided that for beneficial interests which were created prior to the effective date of the act  july   the practitioner could continue to refer patients  or direct an employee to do so  if the practitioner disclosed such interest to his patients 
the disclosure must take the form of a sign posted in a conspicuous place in the practitioner s office informing the patients of such interest and stating that a listing of alternative healthcare service providers could be found in the telephone directory 
all physicians who refer to the company s sites in new jersey and also have a financial interest in those sites have a sign posted as mandated by the law
