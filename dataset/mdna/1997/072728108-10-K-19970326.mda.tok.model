item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
emergence from chapter on february   great bay filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
on november  the confirmation date  a formal confirmation order by the bankruptcy court with respect to great bay s amended bankruptcy plan became effective 
at that time  great bay emerged from bankruptcy 
as a result of the chapter proceeding and in accordance with the provisions of the amended bankruptcy plan  the capital structure of great bay was completely changed 
in particular  as part of its chapter proceeding  great bay discharged all of its pre petition debt  which consisted primarily of the approximately million principal amount of outstanding notes and unpaid accrued interest on the notes of approximately million  and raised gross proceeds of million in the amended bankruptcy plan 
see business bankruptcy proceeding and reorganization 
thus  as a result  great bay s net worth increased significantly and great bay was relieved of the obligation to make principal and interest payments on the notes 
the following discussion focuses solely on operating revenues and operating expenses which are presented in a substantially consistent manner for all of the periods presented 
as a result of the chapter proceeding and subsequent effectiveness of the amended bankruptcy plan on november   the statement of income represents separately the results of operations of the predecessor company prior to november  from the results of operations of great bay after that date 
on the confirmation date  great bay adopted a fresh start balance sheet 
this balance sheet reflects the assets and liabilities of great bay at their estimated fair values as of the confirmation date  including the net proceeds of the equity financing for the amended bankruptcy plan  and eliminating liabilities discharged under the amended bankruptcy plan 
overview great bay reported income before extraordinary item for the year ended december  and reported a loss before extraordinary item for the year ended december  and the combined twelve month period ended december  the income was primarily due to a gain of  from the sale of unused steam generators from seabrook unit the losses in and were primarily due to sales of great bay s share of electricity from the seabrook project in the short term market at prices resulting in revenues substantially below actual expenses 
the seabrook project from time to time experiences both scheduled and unscheduled outages 
great bay incurs losses during outage periods due to the loss of all operating revenues and additional costs associated with the outages as well as continuing operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation 
unscheduled outages or operation of the unit at reduced capacity can occur due to the automatic operation of safety systems following the detection of a malfunction 
in addition  it is possible for the unit to be shut down or operated at reduced capacity based on the results of scheduled and unscheduled inspections and routine surveillance by seabrook project personnel 
it is not possible for great bay to predict the frequency or duration of any future unscheduled outages  however  it is likely that such unscheduled outages will occur 
the managing agent of the seabrook project has scheduled the next refueling outage for may refueling outages are scheduled generally every to months depending upon the seabrook project capacity factor and the rate at which the nuclear fuel is consumed 
results of operations operating revenues great bay s operating revenues for increased by approximately million  or  to  as compared with  for this increase was primarily due to higher availability and production at the seabrook project due to fewer unscheduled and scheduled outages in compared to during  the capacity factor at the seabrook project was of the rated capacity versus a capacity factor of for operating revenue and capacity factor were negatively affected in by the scheduled refueling outage at the seabrook project which occurred during parts of both november and december in contrast  there was only a brief unscheduled outage in january and february of sales of electricity increased by approximately to  kilowatt hours in as compared to  kilowatt hours in operating revenues were also favorably affected in by an increase in the sales price per kwh 
during the sales price per kwh determined by dividing total sales revenue by the total number of kwhs sold in the applicable period increased to cents per kwh as compared with cents per kwh in great bay s cost of power determined by dividing total operating expenses by great bay s share of the power produced by the seabrook project during the applicable period decreased to cents per kwh in as compared to cents per kwh in this decrease was primarily the result of the higher capacity factor at the seabrook project in as compared to scheduled and unscheduled outage time increases great bay s cost of power because seabrook costs are spread over fewer kwhs 
great bay s operating revenues for increased by approximately million  or  as compared with the combined twelve months ended the increase was primarily due to reduced scheduled and unscheduled outage time during  with a capacity factor of in as compared with in the combined twelve months ended operating revenues were also favorably affected in by an increase in the sales price per kwh to cents per kwh as compared with cents per kwh in the combined twelve months ended great bay s cost of power decreased to cents per kwh in as compared with cents per kwh in the combined twelve months ended  primarily a result of reduced depreciation and amortization expenses in resulting from the write down to fair value of all of great bay s assets following its emergence from bankruptcy in november expenses increases in depreciation and amortization  taxes  and administrative and general expenses contributed to a small overall increase in expenses of  
from  in to  in other income increased  or million  reflecting a million gain on sale of assets in july of  when great bay received approximately million from the proceeds of the sale by the joint owners of the seabrook project of four unused steam generators from seabrook unit great bay had previously written off its investment of seabrook unit and recognized a gain on this sale 
this increase in other income was offset in part by great bay s recognition in of its share of the seabrook project s decommissioning liability 
during  great bay began to accrete it share of the seabrook project s decommissioning liability in dollars rather than dollars 
in there was no expense for great bay s share of the seabrook project s decommissioning liability because the entire amount of great bay s share of the seabrook project s decommissioning liability was reflected as a liability on great bay s balance sheet under fresh start accounting principles 
this accretion is a non cash charge and recognizes great bay s liability related to the closure and decommissioning of its nuclear plant in current year dollars over the licensing period of the plant 
great bay s total operating expenses excluding depreciation and all taxes for increased million  or  in comparison with the combined twelve months ended  primarily a result of increased administrative and general expenses 
this increase was partially offset by lower maintenance costs during the seabrook project s scheduled outage 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by to million during as compared with million in the combined twelve months ended the decrease was the result of a reduction in the depreciable value of great bay s investment in the seabrook project due to the write down to fair value of all of great bay s assets following its emergence from bankruptcy in november in the combined twelve months ended  as part of its emergence from bankruptcy  great bay wrote off million in assets and liabilities 
interest income increased in to million as a result of great bay s significantly higher cash and investment balances 
net operating losses for federal income tax purposes  as of december   the company had net operating loss carry forwards nols of approximately million  which are scheduled to expire between and because the company has experienced one or more ownership changes  within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  an annual limitation is imposed on the ability of the company to use million of these carryforwards 
the company s best estimate at this time is that the annual limitation on the use of million of the company s nols is approximately million per year 
the company s other million of nols are not currently subject to such limitations 
liquidity and capital resources great bay is required under the joa to pay its share of seabrook unit and seabrook unit expenses  including  without limitation  operation and maintenance expenses  construction and nuclear fuel expenditures and decommissioning costs  regardless of the level of seabrook unit s operations 
seabrook project expenses to preserve and protect unit assets approximate  per year  of which great bay s share is approximately  per year 
great bay currently is selling most of its power in the northeast united states short term wholesale power market 
the cash generated from electricity sales by great bay is and has been less than great bay s ongoing cash requirements 
great bay expects that it will continue to incur cash deficits until the prices at which it is able to sell its share of the seabrook project electricity increase  which may be a number of years  if ever 
great bay intends to cover such deficits with its cash and short term investments which totaled approximately million at december  however  if the seabrook project operates at a capacity factor below historical levels  or if expenses associated with the ownership or operation of the seabrook project  including without limitation decommissioning costs  are materially higher than anticipated  or if the prices at which great bay is able to sell its share of the seabrook project electricity do not increase at the rates and within the time expected by great bay  great bay would be required to raise additional capital  either through a debt financing or an equity financing  to meet its ongoing cash requirements 
great bay s principal asset available to serve as collateral for borrowings is its joint interest in the seabrook project 
pursuant to a power purchase agreement  dated as of april   between great bay and unitil power corp  great bay s interest in the seabrook project is encumbered by a mortgage 
this mortgage may be subordinated to up to million of senior secured financing 
great bay s cash and short term investments increased approximately million during principal factors affecting liquidity during included the operating income discussed above and the receipt of million dollars from peco energy in connection with peco s purchase and subsequent exercise of its warrant to purchase of the company s common stock 
non cash charges to income included million for depreciation  million for nuclear fuel amortization  decommissioning trust fund accretion of million and an increase in miscellaneous current liabilities of million attributable to the accrual for outage related expenses and the year end accrual for seabrook pensions 
partially offsetting the items listed above were cash charges of million for capital expenditures for plant and nuclear fuel and an increase in accounts receivable of million due to the resumption of power sales in following reduced sales in december as a result of the scheduled outage during that month 
also in  great bay purchased  shares of the company s common stock for  great bay s decommissioning payments totaled approximately million 
the decommissioning funding schedule is determined by the ndfc  which reviews such schedule for the seabrook project at least annually 
great bay s decommissioning payments for fiscal will depend on the outcome of pending proceedings before the ndfc 
great bay expects to use revenues from the sale of power to make these decommissioning payments 
the current review by the nrc could substantially increase great bay s costs of decommissioning funding if great bay does not meet the nrc s definition of an electric utility see business recent developments 
great bay anticipates that its share of the seabrook project s capital expenditures for the fiscal year will total approximately million for nuclear fuel and various capital projects 
for each of the tax years  and  great bay has filed property tax abatement applications with the three new hampshire towns in which the seabrook project is located 
great bay paid the first half of its property taxes to the towns and withheld payment of the second half of its property taxes to the towns  based on the company s position that the portion of property taxes paid to the towns exceeds the amount of the total property taxes appropriately payable by great bay to the towns 
the full amount of great bay s property tax expense is reflected in the company s financial statements 
the outcome of the company s appeals with respect to property tax assessments will affect the company s liquidity and obligation for property tax payments in the future 
see business legal proceedings 
certain factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  excepts  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the results of baycorp and or great bay to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 
ownership of a single asset 
baycorp s sole asset is it equity interest in great bay 
great bay owns a single principal asset  a joint interest in the seabrook nuclear power project in seabrook  new hampshire 
accordingly  great bay s results of operations are completely dependent upon the successful and continued operation of the seabrook project 
in particular  if the seabrook project experiences unscheduled outages of significant duration  great bay s results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
history of losses  implementation of business strategy 
great bay has never reported an operating profit for any year since its incorporation 
great bay s business strategy is to seek purchasers for its share of the seabrook project electricity output at prices  either in the short term market or pursuant to medium or long term contracts  significantly in excess of the prices currently available in the short term wholesale electricity market since sales at current short term rates do not result in sufficient revenue to enable great bay to meet its cash requirements for operations  maintenance and capital related costs 
great bay s ability to obtain such higher prices will depend on regional  national and worldwide energy supply and demand factors which are beyond the control of great bay 
there can be no assurance that great bay ever will be able to sell power at prices that will enable it to meet its cash requirements 
liquidity needs 
as of december   great bay had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company believes that such cash  together with the anticipated proceeds from the sale of electricity by great bay  will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its cash requirements until the prices at which great bay can sell its electricity increase sufficiently to enable the company to cover its annual cash requirements 
however  if the seabrook project operated at a capacity factor below historical levels  or if expenses associated with the ownership or operation of the seabrook project  including without limitation decommissioning costs  are materially higher than anticipated  or if the prices at which great bay is able to sell its share of the seabrook project electricity do not increase at the rates and within the time expected by great bay  great bay or the company would be required to raise additional capital  either through a debt financing or an equity financing  to meet its ongoing cash requirements 
there is no assurance that great bay or the company would be able to raise such capital or that the terms on which any additional capital is available would be acceptable 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  dilution to then existing stockholders will result 
changes in power sale contract terms available in wholesale power market 
in the past  wholesale sellers of electric power  which typically were regulated electric utilities  frequently entered into medium or long term power sale contracts providing for prices in excess of the prices available in the short term market  which includes contracts of one year or less in duration 
in recent years  increased competition in the wholesale electric power market  reduced growth in the demand for electricity  low prices in the short term market and the uncertainty associated with deregulation of the industry have reduced the willingness of wholesale power purchasers to enter into medium or long term contracts and have reduced the prices obtainable from such contracts 
risks in connection with joint ownership of seabrook project 
great bay is required under the agreement for joint ownership  construction and operation of new hampshire nuclear units dated may   as amended  by and among great bay and the other utility companies who are owners of the seabrook project the joa  to pay its share of seabrook unit and seabrook unit expenses  including without limitation operations and maintenance expenses  construction and nuclear fuel expenditures and decommissioning costs  regardless of seabrook unit s operations 
under certain circumstances  a failure by great bay to make its monthly payments under the joa entitles certain other joint owners of the seabrook project to purchase great bay s interest in the seabrook project for of the then fair market value thereof 
in addition  the failure to make monthly payments under the joa by owners of the seabrook project other than great bay may have a material adverse effect on great bay by requiring great bay to pay a greater proportion of the seabrook unit and seabrook unit expenses in order to preserve the value of its share of the seabrook project 
in the past  certain of the owners of the seabrook project other than great bay have not made their full respective payments 
the electric utility industry is undergoing significant changes as competition and deregulation are introduced into the marketplace 
some utilities  including certain participants  have indicated in state regulatory proceedings that they may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection if regulators  as part of the industry restructuring  do not allow for full recovery of stranded costs 
on february   the nhpuc issued an order requiring stranded cost recovery to be based on the average market price of electricity in new england  rather than alternative regulatory accounting methods that are more favorable to the participants 
on march   one of the participants  northeast utilities along with three of its subsidiaries commenced litigation against the nhpuc involving the issue of proper accounting for stranded cost recovery 
if a participant other than great bay were to file for bankruptcy  and such participant was unable to pay its share of seabrook project expenses  great bay might be required to pay a greater portion of seabrook project expenses 
in the past  the filing of bankruptcy by a participant has not resulted in a failure to pay seabrook project expenses or an increase in the percentage of expenses paid by other participants 
the seabrook project is owned by great bay and the other owners thereof as tenants in common  with the various owners holding varying ownership shares 
this means that great bay  which owns only a interest  does not have control of the management of the seabrook project 
as a result  decisions may be made affecting the seabrook project notwithstanding great bay s opposition 
certain costs and expenses of operating the seabrook project or owning an interest therein  such as certain insurance and decommissioning costs  are subject to increase or retroactive adjustment based on factors beyond baycorp s or great bay s control 
the cost of disposing of unit of the seabrook project is not known at this time 
these various costs and expenses may adversely affect great bay  possibly materially 
extensive government regulation 
the seabrook project is subject to extensive regulation by federal and state agencies 
in particular  the seabrook project and great bay as part owner of a licensed nuclear facility  are subject to the broad jurisdiction of the nrc  which is empowered to authorize the siting  construction and operation of nuclear reactors after consideration of public health and safety  environmental and antitrust matters 
great bay is also subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc and  as a result  is required to file with ferc all contracts for the sale of electricity 
ferc has the authority to suspend the rates at which great bay proposes to sell power  to allow such rates to go into effect subject to refund and to modify a proposed or existing rate if ferc determines that such rate is not just and reasonable 
ferc s jurisdiction also includes  among other things  the sale  lease  merger  consolidation or other disposition of facilities  interconnection of certain facilities  accounts  service and property records 
compliance with the various requirements of the nrc and ferc is expensive 
noncompliance with nrc requirements may result  among other things  in a shutdown of the seabrook project 
the nrc has promulgated a broad range of regulations affecting all aspects of the design  construction and operation of a nuclear facility  such as the seabrook project  including performance of nuclear safety systems  fire protection  emergency response planning and notification systems  insurance and quality assurance 
the nrc retains authority to modify  suspend or withdraw operating licenses  such as that pursuant to which the seabrook project operates  at any time that conditions warrant 
the nrc might order seabrook unit shut down i if flaws were discovered in the construction or operation of seabrook unit  ii if problems developed with respect to other nuclear generating plants of a design and construction similar to unit  or iii if accidents at other nuclear facilities suggested that nuclear generating plants generally were less safe than previously believed 
great bay is also subject to the new hampshire public utility law and regulations of the nhpuc which affect  among other things  the issuance of securities  transfer of utility property and contacts with affiliates as well as the sale  lease  merger  consolidation or other disposition of facilities 
the nhpuc does not regulate wholesale electricity rates 
risk of nuclear accident 
nuclear reactors have been used to generate electric power for more than years and there are currently more than nuclear reactors used for electric power generation in the united states 
although the safety record of such nuclear reactors in the united states generally has been very good  accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred both in the united states and elsewhere  including the well publicized incidents at three mile island in pennsylvania and chernobyl in the former soviet union 
the consequences of such an accident can be severe  including loss of life and property damage  and the available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay all the damages incurred 
public controversy concerning nuclear power plants 
substantial controversy has existed for some time concerning nuclear generating plants and over the years such opposition has led to construction delays  cost overruns  licensing delays  demonstrations and other difficulties 
the seabrook project was the subject of significant public controversy during its construction and licensing and remains controversial 
an increase in public concerns regarding the seabrook project or nuclear power in general could adversely affect the operating license of seabrook unit while great bay cannot predict the ultimate effect of such controversy  it is possible that it could result in a premature shutdown of the unit 
waste disposal  decommissioning cost 
there has been considerable public concern and regulatory attention focused upon the disposal of low and high level nuclear wastes produced at nuclear facilities and the ultimate decommissioning of such facilities 
as to waste disposal concerns  both the federal government and the state of new hampshire are currently delinquent in the performance of their statutory obligations 
see business nuclear waste disposal 
in april  a privately owned facility in utah was approved as a disposal facility for certain types of llw 
additionally  the barnwell  south carolina disposal facility was reopened in july to all states except north carolina as a result of legislation passed by the south carolina legislature 
the seabrook project began shipping certain llw to the utah facility in december all llw generated by the seabrook project which exceeds the maximum radioactivity level of llw accepted by the utah facility is stored on site at the seabrook facility 
based on information provided by naesco  management believes that the on site storage capacity for llw generated by the seabrook project is adequate until at least as to decommissioning  the nrc regulations require that upon permanent shutdown of a nuclear facility  appropriate arrangements for full decontamination and decommissioning of the facility be made 
these regulations include a requirement to set aside during operation sufficient funds to defray decommissioning costs 
while the owners of the seabrook project are accumulating a trust fund to defray decommissioning costs  these costs could substantially exceed the value of the trust fund  and the owners including great bay would remain liable for the excess 
moreover  the amount that is required to be deposited in the trust fund is subject to periodic review and adjustment by an independent commission of the state of new hampshire  which could result in material increases in such amounts 
in january  the nrc issued a temporary exemption related to great bay s status as an electric utility as defined in the nrc s regulations 
in the exemption  the nrc staff stated that it believes that great bay currently does not satisfy the nrc definition of electric utility 
if great bay is an electric utility  then the nrc decommissioning requirements are satisfied by great bay making monthly payments into the decommissioning trust fund 
if great bay is not an electric utility  the nrc can require that great bay provide a surety bond or other allowable decommissioning funding mechanisms 
a review of great bay s status as an electric utility by the nrc is currently in process  which may materially and adversely affect great bay s liquidity 
intense competition 
great bay sells its share of seabrook project electricity primarily into the northeast united states wholesale electricity market 
there are a large number of suppliers to this market and competition is intense 
a primary source of competition comes from traditional utilities  many of which presently have excess capacity 
in addition  non utility wholesale generators of electricity  such as ipps  qfs and ewgs  as well as power marketers and brokers  actively sell electricity in this market 
great bay may face increased competition  primarily based on price  from all sources in the future 
risk related to holding company 
in contrast with great bay  the activities of baycorp will not be subject to the extensive government regulation related to public utilities and licensed nuclear facilities 
thus  baycorp will not receive the benefit of the scrutiny by federal and state agencies that great bay receives 
in addition  baycorp may pursue activities with a greater business risk than those associated with a regulated entity such as great bay 
depending on the success of any new activities that baycorp determines to pursue  it is possible that baycorp s earnings per share and dividends  if any  might be lower than if baycorp did not pursue such activities
