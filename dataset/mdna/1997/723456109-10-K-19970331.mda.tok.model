the state of california sponsors a lottery  which the company believes has had a negative impact on racing revenues 
although no local race tracks operate live thoroughbred meets concurrently with hollywood park  the company believes its operations have been adversely impacted by the proliferation of additional racing opportunities both in california and outside the state 
these opportunities have made it more difficult for hollywood park to attract quality thoroughbreds  particularly during the spring and summer months when demand for such horses is greatest 
the company believes that the simulcast legislation has had a positive impact on the company s overall revenues  primarily as the result of a significant increase in off track and simulcast racing revenues  although on track attendance and pari mutuel handle have declined 
no assurance can be given that such a decline in on track attendance and pari mutuel wagering will not continue or that the company will continue to benefit from simulcast wagering in the future
