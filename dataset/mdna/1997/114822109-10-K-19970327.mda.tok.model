the gourmet coffee industry the gourmet coffee industry represents a portion of the overall coffee market  is fragmented and has historically been characterized by local and regional competition 
the company has two principal national competitors  sark s gourmet coffee company  which is owned by the nestle sa  and millstone coffee  inc  which was purchased by the procter gamble company in the us coffee market consists of three distinct product categories commercial ground roast  mass merchandised coffee  which includes brands such as folgers and maxwell house  premium coffees  which are slightly higher quality coffees recently introduced into the marketplace by the national roasters  and gourmet coffees  typically defined as super premium  specialty coffees  which are made from the highest quality coffee beans and sold in supermarkets  gourmet food stores and specialty coffee stores 
the company sells only gourmet coffees 
gourmet coffees use arabica beans grown in colombia  brazil  kenya  indonesia  mexico  costa rica  guatemala and other central american  south american  asian and african countries producing countries  and in hawaii 
as a result of their richer taste  lower acidity and lower caffeine content  arabica beans are considered to be superior to the robusta beans typically used in commercial ground roast coffee 
the company s products are sold throughout the united states 
the company intends to capitalize on its position as one of the leading wholesalers of gourmet coffee in the united states by maintaining a consistently high quality product  providing customers with the freshest possible product  increasing its penetration in the wholesale channels of distribution and further developing its brand franchise and consumer loyalty 
in order to maintain consistently high quality products for its customers  the company sources  roasts  packages and markets its own products 
the company purchases green arabica coffee beans from producing countries and hawaii for use in its varietals and blended coffee products 
the company combines the purchase of high quality coffee beans with stringent roasting standards and quality testing at each critical stage of the roasting process  including post roasting classification of the beans 
the company has a national presence in the wholesale distribution channel 
the company plans to continue to expand its supermarket presence by increasing distribution to supermarket chains  grocery stores  warehouse stores and mass merchandisers which do not currently purchase products from the company  obtain larger and more preferred shelf space for its products in supermarket chains and grocery stores that already purchase products from the company and increase consumer awareness of the company s products 
the company s ability to implement this plan will be dependent  in part  on the amount of capital financing available to the company 
there can be no assurance that such capital financing will be available to the company 
see part i  item business credit facilities below 
the company also intends to actively seek out opportunities to expand its presence in the specialty stores segment of the wholesale distribution channel and to explore distribution opportunities in other related segments of the wholesale channel 
to this end  in fiscal year  the company entered into an arrangement with hallmark cards  inc  to be the preferred provider of specialty coffee in trial sizes and gift packs for their gold crown retail outlets and an arrangement with continental airlines to be the primary provider of gourmet coffee on all of its flights 
products the company roasts green arabica coffee beans to produce over different varietals  blends and flavors of coffee 
in addition  the company intends to continue to be innovative in the introduction and marketing of new sizes and types of packaging designed to promote consumer convenience and trial purchases 
to this end  in fiscal year  the company introduced its new ounce can and ounce mini can and redesigned the packaging for all of its coffees 
brothers is the company s primary national supermarket brand and is supplemented in the supermarket distribution channel by several regional brands including hillside coffee  cafe du jour and country mill 
in the gourmet specialty store channel  the company s products are sold under the fairwinds brand name 
these regional brands are used by the company to maintain historical regional brand awareness and to provide flexibility for the company and the wholesaler to offer multiple gourmet coffee products 
the company also has a private label program 
distribution the company provides its products to customers using direct store delivery utilizing the company s own trucks dsd  direct shipments to customer warehouses and specialty food distributors 
each of these distribution methods has historically accounted for approximately one third of the company s sales 
the company anticipates that dsd will account for more than one third of its sales in future years 
management information systems the company s accounting and management information systems operate from an upgraded ibm as computer which allows for integrated processing of all accounting records  incorporation of newly acquired businesses and integration of production and back office systems 
the company s mis uses sophisticated software  including general ledger  accounts receivable and payable  sales order processing and product data management programs 
during fiscal year  the company began implementing new software for inventory management that tracks all of the inventory through a bar code system  began developing software that will assist it in maximizing efficiency of its production facility  acquired approximately of its volume purchased using electronic data interchange and updated several of its jd edwards software modules  such as accounts receivable and accounts payable software 
the company spent approximately  on mis upgrades in fiscal year manufacturing and quality control at the end of fiscal year  the company had three regional production facilities  located in pennsylvania  colorado and texas 
as part of its restructuring plan  and in order to reduce plant overhead costs  the company closed its colorado facility in january and its pennsylvania facility in april and consolidated all of its production facilities in its houston  texas  facility 
the company utilizes automated roasting  blending and packaging systems at its houston facility 
coffee specialists oversee these systems to ensure that the product is produced to exact specifications 
the company generally operates a single shift and runs a second shift when production warrants 
the company employs a quality control department  with quality checks made at critical stages of the coffee making process  including post roasting classification and pre shipment inspections of coffee beans 
all coffees roasted by the company are sampled to ensure consistency in the blend  roast and taste 
the quality control department also analyzes competing brands and continuously measures the company s coffees against others in the marketplace 
after the coffee has been packaged  a final check is made to ensure that there are no defects in the packaging which would affect the freshness of the coffee 
supply of coffee coffee is the world s second largest traded commodity 
supply and price can be volatile 
while most coffee trades in the commodities market  coffee of the quality level sought by the company has a tendency to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium above commodity coffee pricing  depending upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase 
the supply and price can be affected by multiple factors  such as weather  politics and economics in the producing countries  many of which are lesser developed nations 
the international coffee organization  through the imposition of export quotas agreed upon by consumer and producer member nations  has in the past attempted to maintain the commodity prices of green coffees 
in july  the refusal of certain countries to participate in the quota system resulted in the dissolution of the agreement and a drop in the prices of coffees 
in august  coffee producing countries formed a new cartel  the association of coffee producing countries acpc  and announced plans to cut the supply of coffee by beginning october  in an attempt to raise world coffee prices 
the effect of the acpc on coffee prices is difficult to determine in light of the price increases resulting from the frosts in brazil discussed below 
nonetheless  the acpc met in november of and resolved to withhold of their exportable green coffee bean crop in an effort to raise and sustain green coffee bean prices 
in january  the acpc agreed to extend its current limitations on the supply of green coffee upon their expiration in june through the green coffee year 
the company is unable to predict whether the acpc will be successful in achieving its goals  however  the supplies of green coffees held by consumers roasters and buyers are currently at historical low levels 
brazil experienced frosts in june and july which reportedly damaged approximately of its green coffee bean crop 
the announcement of the brazilian frost damage caused a substantial increase in green coffee bean prices and other coffee product related prices worldwide 
the company purchases a modest amount of its green coffee beans from brazil 
nonetheless  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  the company experienced a significant increase in the price of green coffee beans which carried into the first three quarters of fiscal year during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company s green coffee purchases and commitments returned to pricing levels closer to those that existed prior to the june brazilian frost 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company is unable to predict weather events that may adversely affect coffee supplies in particular countries 
in the past  when green coffee bean prices have increased  the company has been able to pass those price increases through to its customers  thereby maintaining its gross profit margins 
the company was not able to pass through to customers all of the price increases in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year following the significant increase in green coffee bean prices that resulted from the brazilian frosts 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal year  the company experienced customer resistance to price increases  although the company believes customers have now accepted the price increases 
in light of the events in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal year  the company cannot predict whether it will be able to pass inventory price increases through to its customers in full in the future 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subsequent events below for a discussion of the increase in the prices of green coffee during the first quarter of the fiscal year ending december  fiscal year 
a significant portion of the company s green coffee supply is contracted for future delivery  generally between three and twelve months forward with declining percentages of the supply being subject to future contracts in the latter portions of each year  to ensure both an adequate supply and reduced risk of short term price fluctuations 
green coffee is a large market with well established brokers  importers and warehousemen through which the company manages its requirements 
in addition to forward purchases  the company keeps physical inventory in its production facility and third party warehouses representing anywhere from four to ten weeks of supply requirements 
all coffee purchase transactions are in us dollars  the industry s standard currency 
the company believes that it is not dependent upon any one importer or broker for its supply of green coffee beans from any particular country

competition competition in the gourmet coffee industry is fragmented and is typically local or regional in nature  with only a few national distributors  one of whom is the company 
the gourmet coffee industry consists of numerous wholesale gourmet coffee roasters 
the gourmet coffee industry is comprised of two principal distribution channels  retail and wholesale 
the company sells its products exclusively through the wholesale channel 
the company considers millstone coffee  inc  and sark s gourmet coffee company to be its principal national level  wholesale competitors 
the company also competes directly against gourmet coffees sold at retail through supermarkets  specialty retailers and a growing number of gourmet coffee stores  such as starbucks  diedrichs and others 
the gourmet coffee segment is becoming increasingly competitive as it continues to grow 
the company s whole bean coffees and coffee beverages also compete indirectly with all other coffees on the market and with other beverages  in particular gourmet teas 
the coffee industry is dominated by several large companies  many of which have significantly greater name recognition and financial resources than the company 
some of these competitors have introduced premium coffee products in recent years  which products comprise one of the fastest growing segments in the coffee industry and are increasingly competing with the company s gourmet coffee products 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors among producers of gourmet coffee are quality of products  shelf space  packaging  distribution capabilities  access to green beans  brand name recognition including the growth of supermarkets selling gourmet coffee packaged under their own private labels  financial resources available to develop new products and promote new and existing products and the ability to operate efficient  low cost roasting and packaging facilities and distribution operations 
there can be no assurance that other national brand coffee companies with greater name recognition and financial resources than the company will not enter the gourmet coffee market in the future 
trademarks the company owns trademarks which are the subject of registrations or pending applications in the us patent and trademark office for many of the trademarks that it uses  including brothers  hillside coffee  cafe du jour  country mill and fairwinds 
the company believes that its common law and registered trademarks have significant value and goodwill and that some of its trademarks are instrumental to its ability to create demand for and market its products 
there can be no assurance that the company s pending applications will be granted or that the company s other trademarks do not or will not violate the proprietary rights of others  that they would be upheld if challenged or that the company would  in such an event  not be prevented from using the trademarks  any of which could have an adverse effect on the company 
seasonality and fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company s business is seasonal  with increased sales during the colder months 
as a result  in a typical year  a substantial portion of the company s sales and an equally large percentage of its reported net income from operations occur during the fourth quarter of each year 
the company s working capital requirements fluctuate each year  with its greatest needs during its third and fourth quarter of each year 
the company s results of operations for any particular quarter may not necessarily be indicative of its results of operations for any other particular quarter or for the whole year 
the timing of slotting fee payments  other similar payments and product introduction costs in connection with wholesale accounts and the amount of revenue contributed by such new wholesale accounts may cause the company s quarterly results of operations to fluctuate in the future 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year  and part i  item business supply of coffee  and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
regulation the production and marketing of the company s products are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal  state and local health agencies  including the united states food and drug administration the fda
