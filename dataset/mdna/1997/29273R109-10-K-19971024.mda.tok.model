item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations of heritage and the partnership should be read in conjunction with the selected historical financial and operating data and notes thereto  and the historical financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
general since its formation in  heritage has grown primarily through acquisitions of retail propane operations and  to a lesser extent  through internal growth 
through august   heritage and the partnership completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the partnership completed of these acquisitions since going public on june  the partnership engages in the sale  distribution and marketing of propane and other related products 
the partnership derives its revenue primarily from the retail propane marketing business 
the general partner believes that the partnership is the seventh largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  based on retail gallons sold  serving more than  residential  industrial commercial and agricultural customers in states through retail outlets 
annual retail propane sales volumes in gallons were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
the retail propane business of the partnership consists principally of transporting propane purchased in the contract and spot markets  primarily from major oil companies  to its retail distribution outlets and then to tanks located on the customers premises  as well as to portable propane cylinders 
in the residential and commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating and cooking 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for crop drying  tobacco curing  poultry brooding and weed control 
in addition  propane is used for certain industrial applications  including use as an engine fuel that burns in internal combustion engines that power vehicles and forklifts and as a heating source in manufacturing and mining processes 
the retail propane distribution business is largely seasonal due to propane s use as a heating source in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of the partnership s retail propane volume and in excess of of the partnership s ebitda is attributable to sales during the six month peak heating season of october through march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in the partnership s first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flow from operations  however  is greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the six month peak heating season 
a substantial portion of the partnership s propane is used in the heating sensitive residential and commercial markets causing the temperatures realized in the partnership s areas of operations  particularly during the six month peak heating season  to have a significant effect on the financial performance of the partnership 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane use  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater propane use 
the partnership therefore uses information on normal temperatures in understanding how temperatures that are colder or warmer than normal affect historical results of operations and in preparing forecasts of future operations  which bases the assumption that normal weather will prevail in each of the partnership s regions 
the retail propane business is a margin based business in which gross profits depend on the excess of sales price over propane supply costs 
the market price of propane is often subject to volatile changes as a result of supply or other market conditions over which the partnership will have no control 
product supply contracts are one year agreements subject to annual renewal and generally permit suppliers to charge posted prices plus transportation costs at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major delivery points 
since rapid increases in the wholesale cost of propane may not be immediately passed on to retail customers  such increases could reduce the partnership s gross profits 
in the past  the partnership generally attempted to reduce price risk by purchasing propane on a short term basis 
the partnership has on occasion purchased significant volumes of propane during periods of low demand  which generally occur during the summer months  at the then current market price  for storage both at its service centers and in major storage facilities for future resale 
gross profit margins vary according to customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers generate higher margins than sales to certain other customer groups  such as agricultural customers 
wholesale margins are substantially lower than retail margins 
in addition  gross profit margins vary by geographical region 
accordingly  a change in customer or geographic mix can affect gross profit without necessarily affecting total revenues 
analysis of historical results of operations the following discussion reflects for the periods indicated the results of operations and operating data for the partnership 
most of the increases in the line items discussed below result from the acquisitions made by the partnership during the periods discussed 
in fiscal  the partnership consummated seven acquisitions for a total purchase price of million 
in fiscal and  the partnership consummated seven and eight acquisitions for total purchase prices of million and million  respectively 
these acquisitions affect the comparability of prior period financial matters as the volumes are not included in the prior period s results of operations 
amounts discussed below reflect of the results of m p oils partnership  a general partnership in which the partnership owns a interest 
because m p oils partnership is primarily engaged in lower margin wholesale distribution  its contribution to the partnership s net income and ebitda is not significant 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year volume 
during fiscal  the partnership sold retail gallons  an increase of million retail gallons or from the million retail gallons sold in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable both to the volume increases from acquisitions and internal growth  offset by warmer than normal weather during the heating season in the partnership s southeast and southwest areas of operations 
the partnership also sold million wholesale gallons in fiscal  a decrease of million gallons or from the million wholesale gallons in fiscal this decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in wholesale volumes in the foreign operations of m p oils partnership 
revenues 
total revenues for fiscal increased million or to million  as compared to million for fiscal domestic revenues increased million or to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal foreign revenues increased million to million for fiscal  an increase of  as compared to million for fiscal the increase in foreign revenues was all attributable to an increase in the selling price

total cost of sales increased million to million for fiscal  an increase of  as compared to million for fiscal domestic cost of sales increased million or for fiscal to million as compared to for fiscal foreign cost of sales increased million or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal during fiscal  the propane industry witnessed the most volatile propane market since  with the wholesale cost of propane raising rapidly during the heating season 
the increase in foreign cost of sales is primarily attributable to higher propane costs 
the increase in domestic cost of sales is attributable to the increase in propane costs for fiscal and the increase in retail volumes 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million or to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal in spite of the rapid increases in propane costs during the heating season in fiscal  the partnership was able to retain strong margins 
the strong margins experienced in fiscal and the increased retail volumes were responsible for the increase in gross profit over fiscal operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million or to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the majority of this increase was attributable to an increase in wages and plant operations resulting from acquisitions 
vehicle expenses also contributed to this increase  with the majority of the partnership s vehicles operating on propane  due to higher own use fuel costs associated with higher propane prices and volumes 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  an increase of million or as compared to million for fiscal this increase resulted from costs associated with changing to and operating as a public master limited partnership 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million or to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this increase was the result of additional depreciation and amortization associated with the increase in property  plant  and equipment along with intangible assets from the acquisitions the partnership has made 
operating income 
operating income increased million to million  a increase in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase was due to the partnership having increased volumes related to acquisitions and retaining strong margins on these volumes  offset by the acquisition related increases in operating expenses and depreciation and amortization costs 
net income 
net income increased million to million in fiscal  a increase as compared to fiscal s net loss of million 
this increase is the result of higher operating income in fiscal and as well as conversion to a partnership form during fiscal the partnership is not subject to federal income tax whereas a million income tax provision was provided by the company in fiscal the partnership also experienced an extraordinary loss of million on the early extinguishment of debt in fiscal year ebitda 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization increased million  or to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to the increase in domestic margins  plus volumes related to acquisitions and internal growth partially offset by the related increase in operating expenses

liquidity and capital resources the statements contained herein are based on current expectation 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
the ability of the partnership to satisfy its obligations will depend on its future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business and weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
future capital needs of the partnership are expected to be provided by various sources as follows a increases in working capital will be financed on the working capital line of credit and repaid from subsequent seasonal reductions in inventory and accounts receivable b payment of interest cost  and other debt services  will be provided by the annual cash flow from operations c required maintenance capital  predominantly vehicle replacement  will also be provided by the annual cash flow from operations d growth capital  mainly for customer tanks  expended will be financed by the revolving acquisition bank line of credit e acquisition capital expenditures will be financed with additional indebtedness on the revolving acquisition bank line of credit  other lines if credit  issues of additional common units or a combination thereof 
cash flows cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  was million compared to million fiscal the cash flows from operations for fiscal consisted primarily of net income of million and noncash charges of million  principally depreciation and amortization 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal included capital expenditures for acquisitions amounting to million  net of cash received plus million spent for maintenance needed to sustain operations at current levels  new customer tanks to support growth of operations and other miscellaneous capitalized items 
these amounts were partially offset by the proceeds from asset sales of million 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal of million reflects net working capital borrowings of million for operating purposes under the credit facilities available to the partnership and a net increase in long term debt of million used for acquisitions 
these increases were offset by cash distributions to unitholders of million 
financing and sources of liquidity the partnership has a bank credit facility  which includes a working capital facility  a revolving credit facility providing for up to million of borrowings to be used for working capital and other general partnership purposes  and an acquisition facility  a revolving credit facility providing for up to million of borrowings to be used for acquisitions and improvements 
see page f  notes to consolidated financial statements working capital facilities and long term debt 
the partnership uses almost all of its cash provided by operating and financing activities to fund acquisition  maintenance and growth capital expenditures 
acquisition capital expenditures  which include expenditures related to the acquisition of retail propane operations and intangibles associated with such acquired businesses  were million for fiscal year  as compared to million during fiscal description of indebtedness the operating partnership assumed million principal amount of senior secured notes the notes at the formation of the partnership in a private placement with institutional investors 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on each december and june the notes have a final maturity of years  with ten equal mandatory repayments of principal beginning on june  see page f  notes to consolidated financial statements working capital facilities and long term debt 
the note purchase agreement and bank credit agreement contain customary restrictive covenants applicable to the operating partnership including limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  creation of liens and sale of assets 
in addition  the operating partnership must maintain certain ratios of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda and consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense 
these agreements also provide that the operating partnership may declare  make or incur a liability to make a restricted payment during each fiscal quarter  if a the amount of such restricted payment  together with all other restricted payments during such quarter  do not exceed available cash with respect to the immediately preceding quarter  and b no default or event of default exists before such restricted payment and after giving effect thereto 
the agreements provide that cash is required to reflect a reserve equal to of the interest to be paid on the notes 
in addition  in the third  second and first quarters preceding a quarter in which a scheduled principal payment is to be made the notes  available cash is required to reflect a reserve equal to  and  respectively  of the principal amount to be repaid on such payment dates 
the operating partnership is in compliance with all requirements  tests  limitations and covenants related to the notes and bank credit facility 
the assets utilized in the propane business do not typically require lengthy manufacturing process time nor complicated  high technology components 
accordingly  the partnership does not have any significant financial commitments for capital expenditures 
in addition  the partnership has not experienced any significant increases attributable to inflation in the cost of these assets
