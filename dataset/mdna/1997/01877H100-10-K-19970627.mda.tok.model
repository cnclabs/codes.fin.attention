item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was founded in february to focus on the design and development of high performance semiconductor memory products 
in march the company filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code the reorganization 
all of the company s obligations set forth in the plan of reorganization  as modified  have been satisfied  and  in august  the company received a final decree from the bankruptcy court 
since  the company s business strategy has been to be a supplier of high performance memory products and memory intensive logic products  operating on a fabless basis by utilizing independent manufacturing facilities and  more recently  joint venture facilities as well 
due to favorable market acceptance of sram products introduced by the company  annual revenues grew rapidly through fiscal in addition  from september through september  gross profit increased primarily due to reductions in average unit product costs  higher average selling prices  a shift to higher margin products and an increase in manufacturing capacity to address the increased demand for sram products 
as a result  operating income also experienced substantial growth during that same period 
from october through most of fiscal gross profit decreased primarily due to a decline in average selling prices and to pre tax inventory related charges 
the company recorded pre tax charges in fiscal and fiscal of approximately million and million  respectively  to reserve for certain manufacturing issues and to reflect declines in market value for certain of the company s products 
from april  through the early part of fiscal  substantially all of the company s net revenues were derived primarily from the sale of sram products 
during fiscal  the company commenced volume production in micron geometry  mbit drams in a mbitx configuration with access time as fast as ns 
the company also introduced to production its mbit drams in a kbitx configuration and mbit drams in a mbitx configuration 
this family of drams contributed a steadily increasing stream of revenue during fiscal  accounting for approximately of the company s total net revenues 
the company also enhanced its mmui accelerator family with the introduction of the promotion r atd bit d d graphics and video accelerator 
this product family contributed approximately of the company s total net revenues in fiscal finally  the company put into volume production a mbit flash product and introduced a mbit flash design 
flash products did not contribute significant revenue in fiscal a substantial portion of the company s net revenues is derived from a relatively small number of customers in the personal computer industry  although the company did diversify its customer base during fiscal  with no one customer representing more than of the company s net revenues in fiscal the market for memory products used in personal computers is characterized by price volatility and has experienced significant fluctuations and cyclical downturns in product demand 
while the company s strategy is to increase its penetration into the networking  telecommunications and instrumentation markets with its existing sram products and to develop and sell in volume quantities of new products complementary to its existing products  such as drams  mmui accelerators and flash memory products  the company may not be successful in executing such strategy 
a decline in demand in the personal computer industry or lack of success in developing new markets or new products could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
results of operations the percentage of net revenues represented by certain line items in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated  are set forth in the table below 
percentage of net revenues year ended march  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit loss operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net revenues 
the company s net revenues decreased to approximately million in fiscal  from approximately million of net revenues in fiscal the decrease in net revenues in fiscal was due primarily to lower unit demand and lower average selling prices for sram products as compared to the prior year 
during the first half of fiscal  the company benefited from supply and demand relationships that caused the unit demand and average selling prices for the company s sram products to increase 
since that time  the company has experienced significant deterioration in the average selling prices and lower demand for its sram products 
the company believes that the decrease in selling prices was due to a number of factors  including increased supply of srams from foreign and domestic competitors and weakening unit demand for sram products 
such factors created an oversupply situation in the sram markets in which the company participates  with such oversupply condition continuing throughout fiscal the company is unable to predict when or if such price declines will stabilize 
a continued decline in average selling prices of srams could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
during fiscal  the company introduced the mbit and mbit dram products and commenced volume production of mbit dram in a mbitx configuration 
revenues from the company s dram product family grew steadily throughout the year and contributed approximately of the company s net revenues in fiscal the dram market is characterized by volatile supply and demand conditions  fluctuating pricing and rapid technology changes to higher density products 
during fiscal  the average selling prices for the company s drams declined 
the company is unable to predict when or if such price declines will stabilize 
a continued decline in average selling prices of drams could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company introduced the latest enhancement to its mmui product family during fiscal  the promotion r atd  bit d d graphics and video accelerator 
sales of the company s mmui product line contributed approximately to the company s net revenues during fiscal the mmui graphics and video accelerator market is characterized by a large and growing number of competitors providing a steady stream of new products with enhanced features 
a significant decline in average selling prices due to competitive conditions  including overall supply and demand in the market  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company s flash memory products did not contribute significant revenue during fiscal and prior years 
the company s net revenues increased to approximately million in fiscal  or approximately increase over approximately million of net revenues in fiscal during fiscal  one customer accounted for of net revenues 
the increase in net revenues in fiscal was due to a number of factors  including increased unit shipments of sram products  changes in product mix and higher average selling prices as compared to the prior year 
during the first half of fiscal  the company benefited from supply and demand relationships that caused average selling prices for the company s sram products to increase 
since that time  the company has experienced significant deterioration in the average selling prices for its sram products 
the company believes that the decrease in selling prices was due to a number of factors  including increased supply of srams from foreign and domestic competitors and weakening unit demand for sram products 
generally  the markets for the company s products are characterized by volatile supply and demand condition  numerous competitors  rapid technological change  and product obsolescence  conditions which could require the company to make significant shifts in its product mix in a relatively short period of time 
to diversify its product offerings  the company has introduced new sram  dram  mmui accelerators and flash products 
these changes involve several risks  including  among others  constraints or delays in timely deliveries of products from the company s suppliers  lower than anticipated wafer manufacturing yields  and lower than expected throughput from assembly and test suppliers  and less than anticipated demand and selling prices 
the occurrence of any problems resulting from these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
gross profit loss 
the company s gross loss for fiscal was approximately million or approximately of net revenues compared to a gross profit of approximately million or approximately of net revenues for the same period in fiscal the decrease in gross profits resulted primarily from reduced unit demand and lower average selling prices for the company s sram products 
gross profits associated with sales from the company s dram and mmui product families contributed partially to offset the declines attributable to the sram products 
the company s gross profit for fiscal was approximately million or approximately of net revenues compared to approximately million or approximately of net revenues for the same period in fiscal the decrease in gross profit resulted primarily from pre tax inventory and purchase commitment related charges of approximately million to reflect declines in market value for certain of the company s products offset by a favorable supply and demand relationships during the first half of fiscal that caused average selling prices for the company s sram products to generally increase on a quarterly basis through that period 
as a result of the significant deterioration in unit demand and the average selling prices for its sram products  the company s gross margin declined significantly during the last half of fiscal and throughout fiscal the company is unable to predict when or if such decline in prices will stabilize 
a continued decline in average selling prices of any of the company s products could result in a material decline of the company s gross profits unless the company is able to reduce its cost per unit to offset such declines 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reduce its cost per unit at a level to offset a decline in average selling prices 
the company is subject to a number of factors that may have an adverse impact on gross profits  including the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  increased competition and related decreases in unit average selling prices  changes in the mix of product sold  and the timing of new product introductions and volume shipments 
in addition  the company may seek to add additional foundry suppliers and transfer existing and newly developed products to more advanced manufacturing processes 
the commencement of manufacturing at a new foundry is often characterized by lower yields as the manufacturing process is refined 
there can be no assurance that the commencement of such manufacturing will not have an adverse effect on the company s gross profits in future periods 
research and development 
research and development expenses were approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal  approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal and approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal these dollar increases in research and development expenses were primarily due to the addition of new personnel for development of new products and the enhancement of existing products and expenditures for materials related to such development activities 
during fiscal  the company s development efforts focused on advanced process and design technology  srams  drams  flash memory and mmui accelerator products 
research and development expenses are expected to continue to increase in absolute dollars  although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were approximately million or approximately of net revenues compared to approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal  and approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was principally the result of lower sales commissions associated with the decline in revenue and decreased bad debt reserve requirements 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars  although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues 
other income  net 
net other income was approximately million for fiscal  approximately million for fiscal and approximately million for fiscal net other income primarily represents interest and dividend income from investments 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal represented tax benefits accrued at applicable statutory rates 
the effective tax rate for fiscal and represented taxes accrued at applicable statutory rates partially offset by the effect of research and development tax credits 
factors that may affect future results the company s quarterly and annual operating results have historically been  and will continue to be  subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers  anticipated and unanticipated decreases in unit average selling prices of the company s products  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  changes in the mix of products sold  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the gain or loss of significant customers  increased research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  seasonal customer demand and the timing of significant orders 
operating results could also be adversely affected by economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas  other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending  a downturn in the market for personal computers  or order cancellations or rescheduling 
additionally  because the company is continuing to increase its operating expenses for personnel and new product development to be able to support increased sales levels  the company s operating results will be adversely affected if such increased sales levels are not achieved 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  product obsolescence and significant price competition and  as a result  are subject to decreases in average selling price 
the company has experienced significant deterioration in the average selling prices for its sram and dram products 
the company is unable to predict when or if such decline in prices will stabilize 
historically  average selling prices for semiconductor memory products have declined and the company expects that average selling prices will decline in the future 
accordingly  the company s ability to maintain or increase revenues will be highly dependent on its ability to increase unit sales volume of existing products and to successfully develop  introduce and sell new products 
declining average selling prices will also adversely affect the company s gross margins unless the company is able to reduce its cost per unit to offset the declines in average selling prices 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase unit sales volumes of existing products  develop  introduce and sell new products or reduce its cost per unit 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry periodically results in shortages of advanced process wafer fabrication capacity such as the company experiences from time to time 
the company s ability to maintain adequate levels of inventory is primarily dependent upon the company obtaining sufficient supply of products to meet future demand  and any inability of the company to maintain adequate inventory levels may adversely affect its relations with its customers 
in addition  because the company must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of products shipments  there is a risk that the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products because demand for the company s products is volatile and subject to rapid technology and price change 
this inventory risk is heightened because certain of the company s key customers place orders with short lead times 
the company s customers ability to reschedule or cancel orders without significant penalty could adversely affect the company s liquidity  as the company may be unable to adjust its purchases from its independent foundries to match such customer changes and cancellations 
to the extent the company produces excess or insufficient inventories of particular products  the company s operating results could be adversely affected  as they were in fiscal and fiscal  when the company recorded pre tax charges totalling approximately million and million  respectively  primarily to reflect a decline in market value of certain inventory and certain manufacturing issues 
the company currently relies on outside foundries to manufacture all of the company s products 
reliance on these foundries involves several risks  including constraints or delays in timely delivery of the company s products  reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  costs and loss of production due to seismic activity  weather conditions and other factors 
although the company continuously evaluates sources of supply and may seek to add additional foundry capacity  there can be no assurance that such additional capacity can be obtained at acceptable prices  if at all 
the occurrence of any supply or other problem resulting from these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
during the third quarter of fiscal  manufacturing yields of one of the company s products were materially adversely affected by manufacturing problems at one of the company s foundry suppliers 
there can be no assurance that other problems affecting manufacturing yields of the company s products will not occur in the future 
the company conducts a significant portion of its business internationally and is subject to a number of risks resulting from such operations 
such risks include political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  foreign currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
although the company to date has not experienced any material adverse effect on its operations as a result of such factors  there can be no assurance that such factors will not adversely impact the company s operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practice 
the company s corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake faults 
as a result  in the event of a major earthquake  the company could suffer damages which could materially and adversely affect the operating results of the company 
current pending litigation  administrative proceedings and claims are set forth in item legal proceedings and in item licenses  patents and maskwork protection  above 
the company intends to vigorously defend itself in the litigation and claims and  subject to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and based upon discovery completed to date  management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or operating results 
however  should the outcome of any of these actions be unfavorable  the company may be required to pay damages and other expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or operating results 
moreover  there can be no assurance that anti dumping duties will not be imposed on alliance s import of sram products manufactured in taiwan  which duties could materially adversely affect alliance s ability to sell such products in the united states 
as a result of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results  past performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
in addition  stock prices for many technological companies are subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
if revenues or earnings fail to meet expectations of the investment community  there could be an immediate and significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operating activities used cash of approximately million in fiscal  versus providing approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash utilized by operations in fiscal was the result of a net loss plus increases in working capital  while cash generated from operations in fiscal years and was primarily the result of net income generated during the periods  partially offset by increases in working capital 
the decrease in inventory in fiscal is due to a reduction of older sram products partially offset by increased inventory of new products as compared to the same period of the previous year 
the increase in receivables during the same period is the result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal net cash used in significant investing activities in fiscal reflect equipment purchases of approximately million and an investment in usc of approximately million while investing activities in fiscal reflect equipment purchases of approximately million and investments in chartered of approximately million  in usc of approximately million and in usi of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in fiscal resulted from proceeds of a approximately million secured loan and approximately million through issuance of stock upon exercise of options and purchases under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal reflects primarily net proceeds of approximately million from sales of common stock in connection with the company s public offering in april and exercises of stock options and a receipt of umc loan payment of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal reflects primarily net proceeds of approximately million from sales of common stock in connection with the company s public offering in october and exercises of stock options and a decrease in restricted cash of approximately million  partially offset by an installment loan made to umc of approximately million 
at march   the company had approximately million in cash  a decrease of approximately million from march   and working capital of approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from march  the company believes that its existing levels of cash  together with an expected income tax refund will be sufficient to meet its projected working capital and other cash requirements through the end of fiscal in order to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  the company has entered into and will continue to consider various possible transactions  including equity investments in or loans to foundries in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  the formation of joint ventures to own and operate foundries  or the usage of take or pay contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
manufacturing arrangements such as these may require substantial capital investments  which may require the company to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
additionally  the company has entered into and will continue to enter into various transactions  including the licensing of its integrated circuit designs in exchange for royalties  fees or guarantees of manufacturing capacity 
in february  the company agreed to purchase shares of chartered for approximately million and entered into a manufacturing agreement under which chartered will provide a minimum number of wafers from its new wafer fabrication facility currently under construction 
in april  the company entered into a supplemental subscription agreement whereby the company agreed to purchase additional shares in chartered  bringing the total agreed investment in chartered to approximately million 
chartered agreed to increase the minimum number of wafers to be provided to the company from its new wafer fabrication facility 
the company had paid all installments as of march  the company is accounting for this investment on the cost basis of accounting and believes its investment in chartered approximates fair market value at march  the company does not own a material percentage of the equity in chartered 
in july  the company entered into an agreement with umc and s incorporated s to form a separate taiwanese company  usc  for the purpose of building and managing an inch semiconductor manufacturing facility in taiwan 
the facility is now in full production utilizing advanced submicron semiconductor manufacturing processes 
alliance s contribution is in the form of an equity investment  representing an equity ownership of up to approximately 
alliance s investment will be up to approximately us million and will be paid in cash in up to three installments 
the first installment of approximately was made in september  the second installment of approximately was made in july and the company has the option to pay a third installment of approximately payable in july  plus interest at a rate of on such amount from and after july  if this option is exercised  the company will have an equity ownership of approximately and will have the right to purchase up to approximately of the manufacturing capacity in this facility 
a portion of umc s equity contribution was paid through the grant by umc to usc of royalty free licenses to certain umc sub micron process technologies 
to the extent usc experiences operating income or losses  the company will recognize its proportionate share of such income or losses 
the company believes that a number of manufacturers are expanding or planning to expand their fabrication capacity over the next several years  which could lead to overcapacity in the market and resulting decreases in costs of finished wafers 
if the wafers produced by usc cannot be produced at competitive prices  usc could sustain operating losses 
there can be no assurance that such operating losses will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations 
in october  the company entered into an agreement with umc and other parties to form a separate taiwanese company  united silicon inc  for the purpose of building and managing an inch semiconductor manufacturing facility in taiwan 
the facility is expected to commence production in early it is presently contemplated that the manufacturing facility will  over time  require billion to complete its construction and finance operations  although there can be no assurances that production will commence on schedule 
the contributions of alliance and other parties shall be in the form of equity investments  representing an initial ownership interest of approximately for each us million invested 
the alliance investment will be approximately us million and will be paid in cash in up to three installments 
alliance had originally committed to an investment of approximately us million or ownership interest but recently requested that its level of participation be reduced by 
the first installment of approximately of the revised investment was made in january  and the company has the option to pay a second installment of approximately of the revised investment payable in december  plus interest at a rate of on such amount from and after july   and the final installment of approximately of the revised investment is called for on or before fab production ramp up 
umc  its affiliates and members of the taiwanese financial community are expected to provide  over time  the remainder of the capitalization of the new entity  in the form of debt and equity 
a portion of umc s equity contribution is expected to be paid through the grant by umc to the new entity of royalty free licenses to umc s cmos micron and below process technologies under development to be used in the manufacturing facility 
if the company exercises its option and further pays the third installment  the company will have an equity ownership of approximately and have the right to purchase up to approximately of the manufacturing capacity in this facility
