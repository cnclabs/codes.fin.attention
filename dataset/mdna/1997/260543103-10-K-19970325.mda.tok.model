the company declared dividends of per share in  per share in and per share in environment dow s global operations are subject to increasingly stringent laws and government regulations related to environmental protection and remediation 
dow s environmental responsibilities and potential liabilities receive direct and ongoing scrutiny by management to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations 
dow s environmental management standard clearly defines the overall environmental management system  performance objectives and design requirements needed to minimize the long term cost of environmental protection as well as to comply with these laws and regulations 
this standard was reviewed  revised and re communicated throughout the organization in it is dow s stated policy that all global operations and products meet dow s environmental management standard or their country s laws and regulations  which ever is more stringent 
assessments are used by management to continually measure and report dow s progress against this standard and its performance objectives 
it has been dow s policy to adhere to a waste management hierarchy that minimizes the impact of wastes and emissions on the environment 
first  dow works to eliminate or minimize the generation of waste and emissions at the source through research  process design  plant operations and maintenance 
second  dow finds ways to reuse and recycle materials 
finally  unusable or non recyclable hazardous waste is treated before disposal to eliminate or reduce the hazardous nature and volume of the waste 
treatment may include destruction by chemical  physical  biological or thermal incineration means 
disposal of waste materials in landfills is considered only after all other options have been thoroughly evaluated 
dow has specific requirements for wastes that are transferred to non dow facilities 
wastes that are recycled  treated or recovered for energy off site represent less than percent of the total amount of wastes reported as part of the pollution prevention act 
dow s policy of treating its wastes on site has resulted in less than percent of its total environmental liability being directed at remediation under federal or state superfund statutes 
dow s focused approach to waste and emission reduction resulted in achieving its public commitment to reduce global emissions of priority compounds as defined by the us environmental protection agency s program and emissions of an expanded list of compounds defined by each geographic area by percent by base year 
global reductions of percent and percent  respectively  were achieved one year ahead of schedule in in  dow announced a number of voluntary global environment  health and safety eh s goals for the year included are goals to reduce emissions and wastes by percent base year and eh s incidents by percent 
after two years  the company appears to be on track to achieving these goals 
all of the goals  as well as other performance data  can be found in dow s eh s progress report 
in december  raven group ltd 
raven was formed to manage certain of the company s environmental remediation projects 
dow owns percent of the joint venture and the eop group  inc  an environmental consulting firm  owns the remaining percent 
raven will be responsible for providing strategic management to identify cost effective remediation solutions at dow s us manufacturing facilities 
the costs of site remediation are accrued as a part of the shutdown of a facility or  in the case of a landfill  over its useful life 
the nature of such remediation includes the cleanup of soil contamination and the closure of landfills and other waste management facilities 
the policies adopted to reflect properly the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in note a to the financial statements 
to assess the impact on the financial statements  environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies for handling site remediation and restoration 
these liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
dow has been named as a potentially responsible party prp under federal or state superfund statutes at approximately sites 
dow readily cooperates in remediation at sites where its liability is clear  thereby minimizing legal and administrative costs 
however  at several of these superfund sites  dow has had no known involvement and is contesting all liability  at many others  dow disputes major liability  believing its responsibility to be de minimis 
because current law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a superfund site  dow has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies which have also been named prps at each site  the estimated apportionment of costs among all prps and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share 
management has estimated that the company s probable liability for the remediation of superfund sites at december  was million  which has been accrued 
in addition  receivables of million for probable third party recoveries have been recorded related to these sites 
other recoveries for past expenditures are possible since dow has numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers at various times that may provide coverage at different levels for environmental liabilities 
the company is currently involved in litigation to determine the scope and extent of such coverage 
dow has not recorded any receivables for these possible recoveries 
in addition to the superfund related liability referenced above  dow had an accrued liability of million at december  representing the total probable costs that the company could incur related to the remediation of current or former dow owned sites 
the company had not recorded as a receivable any third party recovery related to these sites 
environment continued in total  dow s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was million at december   as compared with million at the end of this is management s best estimate of these liabilities  although possible costs for environmental remediation and restoration could range up to twice that amount 
the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for environmental protection were million in  million in and million in and they are currently projected at million in and million in it is the opinion of the company s management that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of those accrued or disclosed will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures capital spending for the year was billion  down percent from billion in and up percent from billion in capital spending in included spending in pharmaceuticals of million 
in  approximately percent of the company s capital expenditures was directed toward additional capacity for new and existing products  while about percent was committed to projects related to environmental protection  safety and loss prevention  and industrial hygiene 
the remaining capital was utilized to maintain the company s existing asset base  including projects related to productivity improvements  energy conservation and facilities support 
major projects underway during included a new facility in harbor beach in the us to produce tracer insect control product  tie ins to a new energy co generation facility in terneuzen  the netherlands  a new aniline facility in boehlen  germany  an expansion of the vcm facilities in fort saskatchewan  canada  and a membrane chlorine expansion in stade  germany 
because the company designs and builds most of its capital projects in house  it had no major capital commitments  other than for the purchase of materials from fabricators
