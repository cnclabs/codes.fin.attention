item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reorganization asa holdings is a holding company the principal assets of which are the shares of its wholly owned subsidiaries asa and asa investments 
asa holdings became the parent holding company for asa and asa investments pursuant to the reorganization  which was effective after the close of business on december  in may  asa s board of directors approved the reorganization subject to the approval of asa s shareholders 
pursuant to the reorganization  asa merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of asa holdings 
as part of the merger  each issued and outstanding share of asa s common stock other than treasury stock  which was cancelled was converted into one share of asa holdings common stock 
immediately after the merger on december   asa effected a dividend to asa holdings of all of the capital stock of asa investments 
as a result of the reorganization  asa and asa investments became wholly owned subsidiaries of asa holdings 
asa holdings considers the airline business of asa to be its only industry segment 
there was no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements as a result of these transactions 
all references to the company contained in this section refer collectively to asa and its subsidiaries  asa holdings and asa investments  prior to december   and to asa holdings and its subsidiaries  asa and asa investments  beginning december  all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
asa s material lenders consented to the reorganization where asa s credit agreements made such consent necessary 
in addition  during asa renegotiated the restrictive covenants in its credit agreements 
the renegotiated credit agreements currently contain restrictive covenants that limit  among other things  the sale or lease of assets  the acquisition of stock of other entities  the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth  and maintenance of minimum tangible net worth and funds flow coverage 
in addition  the transfer of funds by asa in the form of cash dividends  loans or advances is limited solely to the extent that such transfers would cause asa to breach other financial covenants 
asa holdings and asa investments are not subject to the restrictive covenants of asa s credit agreements except to the extent that asa is restricted in its ability to transfer funds to asa holdings or asa investments in the form of cash dividends  loans or advances 
asa holdings board of directors believes that the holding company structure makes available to asa holdings and its subsidiaries a greater selection of financing  acquisition and organizational alternatives than was available to asa prior to the reorganization 
the holding company structure provides greater flexibility than was available to asa primarily because a any new subsidiaries formed by asa holdings will be insulated from the liabilities of and risks associated with asa s operation of a commercial airline  b asa will be better insulated from the liabilities of any risks associated with the operation of businesses by other subsidiaries of asa holdings  c asa holdings and its other subsidiaries will not be restricted by credit agreements that have been or may be entered into by asa that include restrictive covenants  d asa holdings and its other subsidiaries will not be constrained by the other contracts that  from time to time  are binding on asa  e asa will not be constrained by  the credit agreements or other contracts entered into by asa holdings other subsidiaries  f depending on the business  asa holdings and its subsidiaries may be free from certain direct constraints on asa imposed by regulatory requirements  and g the holding company structure accommodates any future acquisition opportunities  whether the acquisition is inside or outside of asa s current line of business  because asa holdings can now acquire additional businesses directly  thereby permitting these businesses to remain independent of asa s operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital increased to million with a current ratio of at december  compared with working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities increased million in cash provided by operations in was million and the company received million from the disposal of property

asa has an unsecured line of credit totaling million with one of its banks 
at december   
million of this line was committed to support a letter of credit 
the remainder is available for general working capital purposes on an as needed basis 
at december   there were no outstanding amounts against the line of credit 
management believes that  as a result of the reorganization  borrowings from banks  other financial institutions or the securities markets are available to asa holdings on substantially the same terms as were available to asa prior to the reorganization 
asa holdings also can now borrow money directly and use it internally or contribute it to asa or any other subsidiary 
in addition  any of the subsidiaries can borrow money independently 
total assets were down by million at december  primarily due to a million decrease in net property and equipment 
net flight equipment was lower primarily due to approximately million related to the sale of dash and bandierante aircraft and engines which had been previously phased out of operations and a million increase in accumulated depreciation  offset by million of additions in other property and equipment increased primarily due to approximately million of costs related to the relocation of asa s operations to concourse c at the atlanta airport  which has significantly enhanced the convenience of connections between flights operated by asa and delta in atlanta 
current liabilities were down by million to million at december  compared with million at december  the current portion of long term debt decreased by million due to million of debt payments  including the accelerated debt retirement due to the loss of an aircraft  and a million reclassification to long term debt 
interest payable decreased by million due to less debt outstanding and the timing of debt payments at year end  and taxes payable decreased by million due to the timing of property tax payments 
the company s long term debt to equity ratio decreased to at december  compared with in long term debt decreased by million due to million of long term debt payments offset by a reclassification of million from current maturities 
forty eight e brasilia aircraft and four atr aircraft  as well as a significant portion of the asa s spare parts  are pledged to secure long term debt 
current maturities of long term debt  aircraft lease payments  compliance with faa directives and other capital expenditures were funded from the company s cash reserves and internally generated funds during fiscal shareholders equity per share increased to at december  from at the end of net worth increased million in primarily due to earnings of million  offset by million of dividends paid and million of common stock repurchases 
during  asa renegotiated the restrictive covenants in its credit agreements 
see reorganization above 
asa holdings and asa investments are not subject to the restrictive covenants in asa s credit agreements except to the extent that asa is restricted in its ability to transfer funds to asa holdings or asa investments in the form of cash dividends  loans or advances 
asa s dividend to asa holdings of all of the shares of asa investments capital stock in connection with the reorganization provided asa holdings with approximately million of net assets that are free of the restrictive covenants in asa s credit agreements and lease arrangements 
in addition  approximately million of net assets was available at december   for distribution by asa to asa holdings under the most restrictive of these agreements 
the net number of shares of common stock outstanding decreased by million to million at december  due to the repurchase of common stock 
prior to the amendment of these credit agreements  asa was limited in the amount of cash it could apply to the repurchase of common stock and the payment of dividends generally to of average annual earnings 
during the first three quarters of and in  these limitations allowed asa to pay dividends on its common stock in the amount of approximately and million  and acquire approximately and million of its common stock 
in  asa acquired approximately million of its common stock under the previous terms of the agreements 
asa s board of directors authorized asa to repurchase up to an additional million of its common stock on the open market at any time on or before december  and up to an additional million of asa common stock during these repurchases were authorized by the board to be in addition to the repurchases allowed under the existing credit agreements 
because these common stock repurchase programs were not within the limitations set forth in the credit agreements  they were consented to by asa s lenders  in advance  as required by the credit agreements 
pursuant to these repurchase programs  asa repurchased approximately million of its common stock through december  and an additional million of its common stock during all of the repurchased shares of common stock were held as treasury stock 
in connection with the reorganization on december   all of the shares of treasury stock were cancelled 
in january  asa holdings announced that its board of directors authorized it to repurchase up to million of its common stock on the open market during the repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock and used for general corporate purposes or will be cancelled 
repurchases are subject to market conditions 
asa holdings is authorized to issue up to million shares of its common stock whereas asa was authorized to issue up to only million shares of asa s common stock prior to the reorganization 
these additional shares may be issued for a variety of corporate purposes  including  without limitation  a to effect stock splits  b to raise additional capital in future public offerings  c to facilitate corporate acquisitions  or d to pay performance based compensation to employees of asa holdings and its subsidiaries 
asa holdings board of directors is able to approve the issuance of additional shares without shareholder approval 
any such issuances of additional shares would result in dilution of the current equity interest of existing shareholders 
the issuance of such additional securities will be subject to certain limitations imposed by the rules of the nasdaq stock market and by general fiduciary principles 
asa holdings does not have any current plans or pending proposals to issue additional shares of holdings common stock other than pursuant to asa holdings stock appreciation rights plan the sars plan 
in january  asa announced its intentions to acquire crjs from bombardier  inc of canada and to secure options to acquire an additional aircraft  subject to the effectiveness of a definitive acquisition agreement with bombardier  a definitive financing commitment with the export development corporation of canada and a definitive agreement with general electric company with respect to the acquisition of the engines and related spare parts 
at this time  asa has not determined whether the acquisition will be a purchase or lease arrangement or both 
asa estimates that the cost of the aircraft  including spare parts  will be approximately million 
delivery is scheduled to begin during the second half of at the rate of one per month 
the crj is a passenger jet with four abreast seating that asa will use to promote growth in new markets as well as replace some turboprop equipment on existing routes 
on august   asa suffered a tragic loss when one of its flights crashed 
on november   the ntsb  in a unanimous vote  determined that the probable cause of the accident was the in flight fatigue fracture and separation of a propeller blade that resulted in excessive drag  loss of wing lift and reduced directional control of the aircraft 
the ntsb further concluded that the fracture in the propeller blade was caused by a fatigue crack from multiple corrosion pits that were not discovered by the propeller manufacturer because of its inadequate and ineffective corporate inspection and repair techniques  training  documentation and communication 
accordingly  asa s management does not feel that asa was at fault  based on the factual information currently available to it 
asa has received insurance proceeds from its insurance company related to the hull value of the aircraft  and the debt related to this aircraft was paid with part of these insurance proceeds 
a number of claims and lawsuits have been filed in connection with this matter 
the propeller manufacturer through its insurer has agreed to address all claims arising from this accident without acknowledging fault 
accordingly  the company s management does not believe that the company has any liability in this matter  based on factual information currently available to it 
therefore  asa has not accrued a liability for potential claims 
neither the propeller manufacturer nor its insurer has entered into any written indemnity agreement with asa or its insurer  and neither is legally obligated to indemnify either asa or its insurer for expenses actually incurred in connection with the crash 
in addition  asa maintains insurance coverage which it believes  based on factual information currently available to it  is sufficient to cover claims associated with this incident 
after the results of the ntsb investigation were announced  asa was dismissed from all existing lawsuits with respect to the crash 
approximately of asa s workforce are members of the unions representing pilots and flight attendants 
in  collective bargaining agreements with both of these unions became amendable and are currently being renegotiated 
the railway labor act  which governs labor relations for these unions  contains detailed provisions that must be exhausted before work stoppages can occur once a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable 
federal mediation between asa and the pilots and flight attendants has been ongoing for approximately one year 
asa has negotiated to receive interest rate subsidies on certain indebtedness through the export support program of the federative republic of brazil 
outstanding debt aggregating approximately million at december  is subject to subsidy payments which reduce the stated interest rates on such debt to an average of approximately 
of this amount  subsidies on outstanding debt aggregating approximately million are at risk to asa if the federative republic of brazil does not meet its obligations under the export support program 
for the remaining debt that is subject to such subsidies  the lenders have assumed such risk by building such subsidy payments into asa s payment obligations 
during  and  asa reduced its interest expense by approximately  and million  respectively  as a result of these interest rate subsidies 
the amount of net interest paid during  and was approximately  and million  respectively 
as indicated above  there can be no assurance that asa will continue to receive such subsidy payments 
in  asa and delta implemented a marketing program called the delta connection 
at december   delta air lines holdings  inc an affiliate of delta owned approximately of asa holdings outstanding common stock 
delta leases reservation equipment and terminal facilities to asa  and provides certain services to asa  including reservation and ground handling services 
given asa s relationship with delta  asa s results of operations and financial condition may be favorably or adversely impacted by delta s decisions regarding flight routes and other operational matters 
asa has historically benefited from its relationship with delta  but there can be no assurance that such benefits will occur in the future 
based on information currently available to it  the company believes that available resources will be sufficient to meet its existing expenditure commitments including current maturities of long term debt and aircraft lease payments as well as its anticipated capital expenditures and other working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
financial resources anticipated to be available to the company for such purposes include existing cash reserves  internally generated funds  amounts available under the existing line of credit  and short and long term financing arrangements that the company believes are available to it

results of operations the company set new records in passenger traffic  operating revenues and net income in total operating revenues were million in compared with million in and million in operating revenues were up in primarily due to a increase in revenue passenger miles rpms flown to million 
rpms were higher in due to the number of passengers carried increasing by to million while the average trip length decreased by to miles 
in late  asa replaced delta s service to several markets with the bae jet aircraft 
higher passenger traffic in was largely attributable to an increase in traffic in markets served by the bae aircraft 
asa s load factor for was compared with for the average passenger yield passenger revenue divided by rpms increased by 
to cents in compared with cents in  while average passenger fare decreased by to in compared with in passenger fares vary based on a number of factors including competition  fare discounting and economic conditions 
operating revenues in increased over primarily due to a increase in the average passenger yield offset by a decrease in rpms 
asa s average load factor in was  down from in for the year ended december   net income increased by to million compared with million for net income per share for increased to on million weighted average shares outstanding compared with on million weighted average shares outstanding for the decrease in the average number of shares outstanding was due to the stock repurchase programs mentioned above in the liquidity and capital resources section 
in  net income was million or per share on million weighted average shares outstanding 
operating expenses increased in and in the company experienced a increase in the cost per available seat mile asm flown to cents compared with cents in capacity the number of asms was up in due to changes in aircraft as described in the liquidity and capital resources section above 
operating expenses in included 
million of expense related to the company s sars plan due to a increase in the company s stock price and additional vesting  while included million of expense associated with stock appreciation rights sars due to a increase in the stock price and additional vesting 
included in operating expenses for was approximately million of start up expenses associated with adding the bae aircraft to the fleet 
excluding the effect of the sars expense and bae start up costs  operating expenses would have increased in compared with operating costs are higher primarily due to more expensive jet fuel  higher marketing related expenses  increased maintenance costs for the e brasilia turboprop fleet  and rent on the bae jet aircraft 
the bae aircraft are currently being flown over shorter haul routes  and therefore their rent expense per asm is higher than the company s system average 
operating expenses in were up compared with included in were million of bae start up costs and million of sars expense compared with a million credit in due to a decline in the stock price 
excluding the effect of the bae start up costs and sars expense  operating expenses would have increased in compared with primarily due to a higher labor and related costs due to a increase in the average number of employees  b higher maintenance expense due to the frequency of scheduled maintenance inspections and overhauls of time controlled components  and c higher aircraft rent expense due to a partial year s rent on four e brasilia aircraft and four bae jets leased in the following table compares components of operating cost per asm for the years ended december   and labor and related cent cent cent fuel direct maintenance passenger related depreciation and aircraft rent other total operating expense per asm cent cent cent the following table presents various components of operating expense as a percentage of total operating expense for the years ended december   and labor and related fuel direct maintenance passenger related depreciation and aircraft rent other total operating expense the company s break even load factor was in compared with in and in the higher break even load factor in was primarily the result of higher operating expenses 
the slightly lower break even load factor in compared with was primarily attributable to a increase in the average passenger yield offset by a increase in the cost per available seat mile 
labor and related costs were million in  million in and million in the average number of employees in was  an increase of over which contributed to higher labor and related costs 
as mentioned above  included

fuel expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
fuel consumption increased in while the average fuel price per gallon  including taxes and into plane fees  increased in to cents from cents in primarily due to the increase in crude oil prices during and the additional cent per gallon transportation fuel tax in october in august  the united states government increased taxes on fuel  including aircraft fuel  by cents per gallon 
asa was exempt from this tax increase until october this new tax increased the company s operating expenses by million in and 
million in the average price per gallon  including taxes and into plane fees  remained constant in compared with  with consumption increasing 
changes in aviation fuel prices have an industry wide impact and will tend to affect asa s competitors in the same manner as asa 
lower fuel prices may be offset by increased price competition and lower revenues for all carriers 
there can be no assurance that asa will be able to increase its fares in response to any future increases in fuel prices 
direct maintenance expense  excluding labor and related costs  increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
this increase in was primarily due to a increase in capacity and increased maintenance inspections and overhauls of time controlled components 
as with any air carrier  asa s fleet of aircraft is aging and requires more frequent maintenance 
the leased bae jet aircraft are maintenance mature aircraft that are under maintenance plans 
charges for the bae are incurred for each hour that the airframe  engines  landing gear  etc 
are flown  and the charges for these maintenance plans are expensed on a monthly basis 
the anticipated addition of new crj aircraft  which will hold passengers and are expected to be used over longer haul routes  will create a higher capacity over which maintenance costs can be spread 
maintenance expenses in were higher compared with primarily due to the timing for scheduled maintenance inspections and overhauls 
passenger related expenses  which include a majority of the expenses under the caption reservation  commission and other on the company s income statement  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase of million in compared with was primarily due to an increase in travel agency commissions  credit card discounts and reservation fees 
these expenses are directly related to the increase in passengers carried in versus passenger related expenses were approximately of passenger revenue in compared with of passenger revenue in both and delta began charging asa higher fees for reservation service systems in april and higher credit card fees in october aircraft rental costs were approximately million in compared with million in and million in the increased expense in was primarily attributable to three e brasilia aircraft and four bae aircraft leased during the fourth quarter of  as well as a fifth bae aircraft leased in january depreciation expense remained relatively constant at  and million for  and  respectively 
other expenses increased to million in compared with million in and million in the increases in were due primarily to higher station security fees  liability insurance and interrupted trip and baggage claim expenses 
the increases in were due primarily to the same expenses as indicated for plus higher station rent and hull insurance expense 
interest expense decreased to million in compared with million in and million in the decrease in was attributable to lower interest rates on asa s outstanding floating rate debt and less total debt outstanding 
the increase in compared with was attributable to a full year of interest expense for the four atr aircraft purchased in as well as the upward trend in interest rates in interest income was million in compared with million in and million in a decline in interest rates contributed to lower interest income in higher average cash available for investment and a rise in interest rates contributed to the increase in interest income for the company s effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate of due primarily to the impact of state income taxes  net of federal tax benefit
