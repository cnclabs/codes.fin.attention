net interest income net interest income is the principal source of earnings for the company  and consists of interest income on loans receivable  mortgage backed and investment securities  offset by interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income fluctuates due to a variety of reasons  most notably due to the size of the balance sheet  changes in interest rates  and to a lesser extent asset quality

net interest income was million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june  the net interest margin remained constant at for the years ended june  and the stability in the net interest margin between the years ended june  and was primarily due to a basis point increase in the yield on average interest earning assets  offset by an increase in the average cost of funds of basis points 
although the net interest spread declined by basis points  this was offset by growth in the balance of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities  due to the increased capital level of the bank

the average yield on interest earning assets improved during the year ended june  to compared to for the year ended june  the improvement was primarily due to a basis point increase in the average yield on loans receivable and a basis point increase in the average yield on mortgage backed securities  due to upward repricing of adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities owned by the bank 
average loans receivable increased by million  or for the year ended june   while average mortgage backed securities decreased million  as the bank was able to increase earning assets with higher loan originations held for investment purposes rather than through the purchase of mortgage backed securities 
the average balance of investment securities  interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold was relatively consistent for the year ended june  compared to the average cost of savings deposits increased basis points during the year ended june   compared to the year ended june   primarily due to increased rates on certificates of deposits 
because of the inability to increase savings deposits during the years ended june  and  the increase in interest earning assets was funded with borrowed funds  primarily fhlb of chicago advances  and a limited amount of reverse repurchase agreements 
average borrowings increased million during the year ended june  these additional borrowings did lead to a decrease in the average cost of borrowings by basis points  although this is somewhat attributable to the shorter duration of adjustable rate advances from the fhlb of chicago  and short term reverse repurchase agreements 
included in the increase in borrowed funds for the year ended june  is a million unsecured term bank loan which was obtained for the acquisition of nsbi 
the loan carried an interest rate of the one month london interbank offering rate libor plus  or at june  the loan is convertible all or in part  with certain limitations at the end of any repricing period into a fixed rate loan at the discretion of management at over the us treasury rate corresponding to the term to the final maturity of the loan  which is december  average balance sheets the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s consolidated statements of financial condition and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated

the increase is primarily a function of the increased headcount of the bank  due to the addition of the six branches acquired in the merger with nsbi  as well as a new branch opened by the bank  and the addition of support staff 
employee benefits expense increased  although the ratio of benefit costs to compensation costs decline slightly to for the current six month period  compared to for the prior six month period 
the million  or increase during the year ended june  was primarily due to an increase in loan related compensation  most notably a million increase in loan officer commissions  as well as the addition of employees  primarily to staff the new branch and to handle increased loan volume

net unrealized gains in the available for sale portfolio were  at december  mortgage backed securities classified as held to maturity decreased million to million as of december  the decrease is primarily due to amortization and prepayments 
due to the bank s ability to originate sufficient amounts of mortgage loans for its own portfolio  the bank did not purchase any mortgage backed securities during the six months ended december mortgage backed securities classified as available for sale decreased million to million at december   from at june  the decrease is primarily due the sale of of adjustable and fixed rate cmos  as well as normal amortization and prepayments

principal repayments and prepayments on these securities are available exclusively for the repayment of the cmo bonds which they collateralize 
investment securities and mortgage backed securities acquired and classified as available for sale represent a secondary source of liquidity to the bank and the company 
the market value of these securities fluctuates with interest rate movements 
net interest income in future periods may be adversely impacted to the extent interest rates increase and these securities are not sold with the proceeds reinvested at the higher market rates 
the decision whether to sell the available for sale securities or not  is based on a number of factors  including but not limited to projected funding needs  reinvestment alternatives and the relative cost of alternative liquidity sources 
investments and mortgage backed securities classified as held to maturity cannot be sold except under extraordinary and very restrictive circumstances 
generally  these investments are acquired for investment after taking into account the bank s cash flow needs  the investment s projected cash flows  the bank s overall interest rate and maturity structure of the liability base used to fund these investment s and the net interest spread obtained 
to the extent the bank has been able to maintain funding costs below a market rate of interest  the potential negative impact from rising interest rates on investments and mortgage backed securities held to maturity on net interest income in future periods has been substantially mitigated

there was no sales activity  and little development costs incurred during the current six month period

the bank s lending activities reflect its focus as a consumer banking institution serving its local market area by concentrating on residential mortgage lending 
reflective of this focus  the bank has been one of the largest originators of residential mortgages in its market area for years 
in addition to traditional retail originations  the bank also operates a wholesale lending operation that purchases loans from brokers and correspondents 
in connection with these activities  the bank emphasizes the origination of adjustable rate or shorter term loans for its portfolio and sells the majority of its long term fixed rate loans directly into the secondary market 
it is the bank s general policy that approximately of its loan portfolio have adjustable rates or terms to repricing or maturity of seven years or less 
the bank originates and purchases long term fixed rate mortgage loans in response to customer demand  however  the bank sells selected conforming long term fixed rate mortgage loans and a limited amount of arm loans in the secondary market  primarily to the federal national mortgage association fnma and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc 
the volume of current loan originations sold into the secondary market varies over time based on the bank s available cash or borrowing capacity  as well as in response to the bank s asset liability management strategy 
during the six months ended december   the bank originated and purchased million in fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans  of which million  or  conformed to the requirements for sale to fnma and fhlmc and million  or  did not conform to the requirements of these agencies 
during the six months ended december   the bank sold million of these loans in the secondary market 
the bank s nonconforming loans are generally designated as such because the principal loan balance exceeds   as of january   which is the fhlmc and fnma purchase limit  and not because the loans present increased risk of default to the bank 
generally  nonconforming loans are held in the bank s loan portfolio 
loans with such excess balances carry interest rates from one eighth to three eighths of one percent higher than similar  conforming fixed rate loans 
as a result of its acquisition of nsbi  the bank acquired a million loan portfolio 
included in the portfolio as of the acquisition date was a million nationwide portfolio of single family residential mortgage loans which had been purchased through brokers as part of nsbi s loan strategy 
collateral for this portfolio is spread throughout states  puerto rico and the district of colombia 
currently  it is not management s intent to continue the purchase strategy utilized successfully by nsbi  rather management intends to manage this purchased loan portfolio through its maturity 
due to normal amortization and prepayments  this portfolio has a balance of million at december  while the bank has primarily focused its lending activities on the origination of loans secured by first mortgages on owner occupied one to four family residences  the bank  to a lesser extent  also originates multi family mortgage loans  residential construction loans  land acquisition and development loans  commercial real estate loans and a variety of consumer loans

the bank focuses its lending efforts primarily on the retail origination of loans secured by first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residences 
residential loan originations are generated by the bank s marketing efforts  its present customers  walk in customers and referrals from real estate brokers and builders 
the bank s loan officers are compensated primarily through commissions  based on the level of loans originated in accordance with the bank s lending standards 
at december   the bank s one to four family residential mortgage loans totaled billion  or of the bank s total loans receivable 
the bank emphasizes the origination of conventional arm loans and shorter term to maturity or repricing and jumbo loans for retention in its portfolio and fixed rate conforming loans for both portfolio purposes as well as for sale in the secondary market 
the bank s retail residential mortgage originations are predominantly in the bank s market area 
during the six months ended december   the bank originated million of residential arm loans  representing of the total loans originated by the bank during that period 
during the same period  the bank originated million of fixed rate residential mortgage loans  representing of the total mortgage loans originated by the bank during that period 
the bank currently makes adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the bank also offers fha and va guaranteed loans  although at december   such loans represented less than of the bank s total loans receivable 
the bank currently offers a number of arm loan programs under which the interest rate may be fixed for the initial one  three  five or seven year period 
most of the bank s residential arm loans adjust on an annual basis following the initial one  three or five year fixed rate period 
the bank also offered  until recently  arm loans that are fixed for an initial five or seven year period that reprice once at the end of the initial period for the remaining or year term based on a spread above the weekly average of us treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of ten years the ten year treasury constant maturity index 
the bank s arm loans generally carry an initial interest rate which is less than the fully indexed rate for the loan 
the initial discount rate is determined by the bank in accordance with market and competitive factors 
after the initial fixed rate period  the interest rates on the arm loans that adjust annually reprice based on a spread above the published weekly average yield on united states treasury securities  adjusted to a constant maturity of one year the one year treasury constant maturity index 
interest rates and origination fees on arm loans are priced to be competitive in the local market 
these loans are subject to limitations on annual interest rate adjustments of  as well as a lifetime interest rate cap adjustment of either or  and are originated for terms of up to years 
at december   the weighted average term to repricing of the bank s arm loan portfolio was years 
the bank also offers fixed rate mortgage loans with terms to maturity of   and years and fixed rate balloon loans that mature after seven years 
the bank s fixed rate loan products generally offer a monthly repayment option 
interest rates charged on fixed rate loans are competitively priced on a daily basis based on secondary market prices and market conditions 
the bank generally originates its fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans in a form consistent with secondary market standards 
the bank s residential mortgage loans customarily include due on sale clauses giving the bank the right to declare the loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the bank has enforced due on sale clauses in its mortgage contracts for the purpose of increasing its loan portfolio yield  often through the authorization of assumptions of existing loans at higher rates of interest and the imposition of assumption fees 
arm loans may be assumed provided home buyers meet the bank s underwriting standards and the applicable fees are paid 
loan applications are reviewed in accordance with the underwriting standards approved by the bank s board of directors and which generally conform to fnma standards 
loans in excess of  must be approved by a senior officer and loans in excess of million must be approved by the loan committee of the board of directors 
in underwriting residential real estate loans  the bank evaluates both the borrower s ability to make monthly payments and the value of the property securing the loan 
potential borrowers are qualified for arm loans and fixed rate loans based on the initial or stated rate of the loan  except for one year arm loans with a loan to value ratio in excess of and a term greater than years  in which case the borrower is qualified at above the initial note rate 
upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower  credit reports are ordered and income  employment and financial information is verified in accordance with fnma standards 
an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure the proposed loan is undertaken by a bank appraiser or an independent appraiser previously approved by the bank 
it is the bank s policy to obtain title insurance on all mortgage loans 
borrowers also must obtain hazard including fire insurance prior to closing 
the bank also requires flood insurance on a property located in special flood hazard areas 
borrowers are required to advance funds on a monthly basis together with each payment of principal and interest through a mortgage escrow account from which the bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes and hazard insurance premiums as they become due 
the bank has adopted a policy of limiting the loan to value ratio on originated loans and refinanced loans to and requiring that loans exceeding of the appraised value of the property or its purchase price  whichever is less  be insured by a mortgage insurance company approved by the fnma in an amount sufficient to reduce the bank s exposure to no greater than the level 
despite the benefits of arm loans to the bank s asset liability management program  they do pose potential additional risks  primarily because as interest rates rise  the underlying payment requirements of the borrower rise  thereby increasing the potential of default 
wholesale residential lending 
in  the bank commenced a wholesale loan origination division which purchases loans from brokers and correspondents for a fee generally ranging from to 
generally  the bank offers the same type of loan products  both fixed rate and adjustable rate loans  at interest rates similar to those it offers on retail originations 
the purchase of these loans does not necessitate the bank to incur the processing costs associated with its retail originations 
the bank acts as the supplier of funds for the mortgage broker who is responsible for the processing and closing of the loan 
the bank performs its normal underwriting procedures on wholesale originated loans similar to retail loans  and can refuse to purchase any loan which does not meet its underwriting criteria 
wholesale originations were million during the six months ended december  compared to million during the six months ended december   and million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  purchased loans 
at december   the bank had million  compared to million at june   of purchased residential mortgage loans  nearly all of which were acquired as part of the acquisition of nsbi 
the bank does not intend to continue northwestern s strategy of purchasing out of state loans 
the decrease in the balance is primarily due to prepayments and amortization 
the vast majority of purchased loans are secured by properties which serve as the primary residence of the borrower  and which are located primarily in metropolitan areas located in states  puerto rico and the district of columbia 
at december   purchased loans were being serviced by companies  the largest of which serviced million  or of total purchased loans 
the loans in this portfolio were underwritten with substantially the same underwriting standards as those of the bank 
one variation from these guidelines is that loans exceeding fnma and fhlmc limits could be purchased up to  with a loan to value ratio of or less  and up to  with a loan to value ratio of or less with private mortgage insurance 
at december   million  or of the loans in the purchased loan portfolio are in excess of the current fnma limit of  in addition to these underwriting guidelines  original executed promissory notes with proper endorsements are in the possession of the bank 
construction and land lending 
the bank originates loans to finance the construction of one to four family residences  primarily in its market area 
at december   the bank had million of loans to finance the construction of one to four family residences 
the bank also originates loans for the acquisition and development of unimproved property to be used primarily for residential purposes in cases where the bank is to provide the construction funds to improve the properties 
at december   the bank s construction and land loans totaled million  or  of total loans receivable 
the bank finances the construction of primarily individual  owner occupied houses where qualified contractors are involved and on the basis of underwriting and construction loan guidelines 
construction loans are structured either to be converted to permanent loans at the end of the construction phase or to be paid off upon receiving financing from another financial institution 
construction loans are based on the appraised value of the property  as determined by an independent appraiser  and an analysis of the potential marketability and profitability of the project 
construction loans generally have terms of up to months  with extensions as needed 
loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses and as inspections warrant 
land loans include loans to developers for the development of residential subdivisions and loans on improved lots to builders and individuals 
at december   the bank had land loans to developers totaling million 
at december   the largest aggregate amount of land acquisition and development loans to a single developer amounted to million 
loans to developers are short term loans with terms of three to five years 
the loan to value ratio may not exceed and generally is less than 
the majority of such loans are at fixed interest rates  although the bank offers an arm loan product with interest rates which adjust based on a stated percentage over the prime rate 
loans generally are made to customers of the bank and developers with whom the bank has had long standing relationships 
the bank requires an independent appraisal of the property and feasibility studies may be required to determine the profit potential of the development project 
all of the bank s land loans to developers have been made in the chicago metropolitan area 
land loans are also made to local builders for the purchase of improved lots 
at december   the bank had land loans outstanding to local builders totaling million 
such loans are generally for terms of up to three years and are made at the prevailing fixed interest rates quoted for year fixed rate residential mortgage loans 
the loan to value ratio on such loans is limited to 
land loans for the purchase of fully improved lots are also made to individuals 
at december   the bank had land loans to individuals totaling million 
such loans are made for up to year terms with adjustable interest rates which are generally higher than those granted for one to four family residential arm loans 
the loans adjust in accordance with the one year treasury constant maturity index and are underwritten in accordance with the same standards used for residential arm loans 
construction and land loans afford the bank the opportunity to increase the interest rate sensitivity of its loan portfolio and to receive yields higher than those obtainable on arm loans secured by existing residential properties 
these higher yields correspond to the higher risks associated with construction lending 
construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to its completion 
because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property  it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio 
as a result of the foregoing  construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent  in part  on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest 
if the bank is forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default  there can be no assurance that the bank will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of  and accrued interest on  the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs 
in addition  the bank may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time 
the bank has attempted to address these risks through its underwriting procedures and its limited amount of construction lending on multi family and commercial real estate properties 
multi family lending 
the bank originates multi family residential mortgage loans in its market area 
at december   the bank had multi family loans of million  including a portfolio of purchased participating interests of million related to low income housing 
multi family loans represent of total loans receivable at december  arm loans represented of the multi family residential loan portfolio at december  such loans are offered with initial fixed rate periods of one  three  five  seven and ten years 
multi family residential mortgage loans are made for terms to maturity of up to years and carry a loan to value ratio not greater than 
the bank requires a positive net operating income to debt service ratio for loans secured by multi family residential property 
loans secured by non owner occupied properties of more than six units are qualified on the basis of rental income generated by the property 
on loans secured by owner occupied properties of six units or less  the bank will qualify the borrower on the basis of the borrower s personal income and rental income generated by the property 
commercial real estate lending 
in connection with the bank s policy of maintaining an interest rate sensitive loan portfolio  the bank has originated loans secured by commercial real estate  which generally carry a higher yield and are made for a shorter term than fixed rate one to four family residential loans 
at december   the bank had million of commercial real estate loans 
the bank s policy has been to curtail the origination of additional commercial real estate loans 
commercial real estate loans are generally granted in amounts up to of the appraised value of the property  as determined by an independent appraiser previously approved by the bank 
the bank s commercial real estate loans are secured by improved properties located in the chicago metropolitan area 
the bank often requires borrowers to provide their personal guarantees on loans made for commercial real estate 
loans secured by commercial real estate properties are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties  repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
the bank seeks to minimize these risks by lending primarily on existing income producing properties and generally restricting such loans to properties in the chicago area 
the bank analyzes the financial condition of the borrower and the reliability and predictability of the net income generated by the security property in determining whether to extend credit 
in addition  the bank generally requires a net operating income to debt service ratio of at least times 
a loan with an outstanding balance of million at december  represents the bank s largest single commercial real estate loan to one borrower 
the loan is on a shopping center located in carol stream  illinois and is current as to the payment of principal and interest at december  at december   the bank s ten largest commercial real estate loans totaled million  all but one of which are current and performing in accordance with their original or restructured terms 
see asset quality and allowance for loan losses 
other lending 
the bank s other lending activities consist of consumer lending  primarily home equity lines of credit  and to a lesser extent  commercial business lending 
on december   outstanding balances on home equity lines represented million or of the bank s total loan portfolio 
home equity lines of credit are generally extended up to of the appraised value of the property  less existing liens  at an interest rate of the designated prime rate plus prime plus 
for balances in excess of  some of which are subject to floors 
to a lesser extent  the bank offers home equity lines of credit at greater than to of the appraised value of the property 
the interest rate on greater than loan to value lines of credit is the designated prime rate plus 
the bank uses the same underwriting standards for home equity lines of credit as it uses for residential mortgage loans 
other home equity lending consists of million of fixed rate  second mortgage loans with original maturities of fifteen years or less 
at december   the bank s loan portfolio included other loans amounting to million  which consisted of million of automobile loans  million of savings account loans  and million of commercial business loans  student loans and other loans 
in addition  at december   the bank had million in standby letters of credit  one of which totals million to enhance a developer s industrial revenue bond financing of commercial real estate located in the bank s market area 
the bank s second mortgage on this commercial real estate parcel is in the process of foreclosure 
see asset quality and allowance for loan losses environmental issues 
the bank encounters certain environmental risks in its lending activities 
under federal and state environmental laws  lenders may become liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous materials found on security property 
although environmental risks are usually associated with industrial and commercial loans  risks may be substantial for residential lenders like the bank if environmental contamination makes security property unsuitable for use 
this could also have effect on nearby property values 
in accordance with fnma and fhlmc guidelines  appraisals for single family residences on which the bank lends include comments on environmental influences 
the bank attempts to control its risk by training its appraisers and underwriters to be cognizant of signs indicative of environmental hazards 
no assurance can be given  however  that the values of properties securing loans in the bank s portfolio will not be adversely affected by unforeseen environmental risks  although the bank is unaware of any environmental issues which would subject it to liability at this time 
originations  purchases  sales  swaps of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
the bank originates and purchases both arm and fixed rate loans 
its ability to originate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for fixed rate or arm loans in the origination and purchase market  which is affected by the term structure short term compared to long term of interest rates as well as the current and expected future level of interest rates 
the bank sells selected conforming fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market to manage its interest rate risk exposure 
substantially all of these loans are sold without recourse 
these loan sales also allow the bank to continue to make loans when deposit flows decline or funds are not otherwise available for lending 
generally  the loans are sold for cash or securitized and sold in the secondary mortgage market to investors such as fnma and fhlmc  as well as investment banks and other financial institutions 
the bank has also exchanged or swapped loans out of its portfolio for mortgage backed securities primarily with fnma and fhlmc 
generally  the mortgage backed securities are used to collateralize borrowings and deposits or are sold in the secondary market to raise additional funds 
swap activity by the bank is governed by pricing levels in the secondary mortgage market for whole mortgage loans versus securitized mortgage loans  as well as the level of rates for collateralized borrowings 
during the current six month period  the bank swapped and sold million of loans originated  compared to million for the six months ended december   and million during the year ended june  there was no swap activity during the year ended june  the bank has purchased mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations from time to time that coincide with its ongoing asset liability management objectives 
purchases have been minimal during the last years due to the ability to originate and hold adjustable rate loans  as well as recently  fixed rate loans for it portfolio  due to increased capital levels from the acquisition of nsbi 
all of the mortgage backed securities and cmos in the bank s portfolio are issued by or have collateral backed by fnma  fhlmc or gnma  or are backed with whole loan collateral and have an investment grade rating 
coupon rates at december   ranged from to 
at december   mortgage backed securities  net  totaled million  or of total assets  including million which collateralized cmos issued by the bank s special purpose finance subsidiaries 
at december   the bank s mortgage backed securities portfolio had a market value of million  including million related to the cmo s issued by the bank s special purpose finance subsidiaries

upon sale  the bank normally retains the responsibility for collecting and remitting loan payments  inspecting properties securing the loans  assuring that real estate tax payments are made on behalf of borrowers  and otherwise servicing the loans 
typically  the bank receives a servicing fee for performing the aforementioned services equal to at least of for fixed rate mortgages and at least of for arm loans on the outstanding principal balance of the sold loan being serviced 
the following table sets forth information as to the bank s loan servicing portfolio  excluding loans owned by the bank which are serviced by others 
the increase in loans serviced for others for the six months ended december  was small  due to the reduction in sales activity during this period  as the bank has been retaining a greater percentage of fixed rate loan originations

asset quality and allowance for loan losses when a borrower fails to make a required payment by the end of the month in which the payment is due  the bank generally institutes collection procedures 
the bank will send a late notice  and in most cases  delinquencies are cured promptly  however  if a loan has been delinquent for more than days  the bank contacts the borrower in order to determine the reason for the delinquency and to effect a cure  and  where appropriate  reviews the condition of the property and the financial circumstances of the borrower 
based upon the results of any such investigation  the bank may accept a repayment program for the arrearage from the borrower  seek evidence  in the form of a listing contract  of efforts by the borrower to sell the property if the borrower has stated that he is attempting to sell  request a deed in lieu of foreclosure  or initiate foreclosure proceedings 
when a loan payment is delinquent for three or more monthly installments  the bank will initiate foreclosure proceedings 
interest income on loans is reduced by the full amount of accrued and uncollected interest on loans which are in process of foreclosure or otherwise determined to be uncollectible 
on july   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  which impose certain requirements on the identification and measurement of impaired loans 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
for loans which are not individually significant ie loans under  and represent a homogeneous population  the bank evaluates impairment collectively based on management reports on the level and extent of delinquencies  as well as historical loss experience for these types of loans 
the bank uses this criteria on one to four family residential loans  consumer loans  multi family residential loans  and land loans 
impairment for loans considered individually significant and commercial real estate loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
charge offs of principal occur when a loss has deemed to have occurred as a result of the book value exceeding the fair value 
the company s policy for recognition of interest income on impaired loans is unchanged as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
and a loan whether considered impaired or not is classified as non accrual when collectibility is in doubt  and is normally analyzed upon the borrower becoming days past due on contractual principal or interest payments 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  or in the process of foreclosure  previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against interest income 
income is subsequently recorded to the extent cash payments are received  or at a time when the loan is brought current in accordance with its original terms 
classified assets 
the federal regulators have adopted a classification system for problem assets of insured institutions which covers all problem assets 
under this classification system  problem assets of insured institutions are classified as substandard  doubtful or loss 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified  substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful  it is required to establish general allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management 
general allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  but  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss  it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such an amount 
an institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the institution s principal supervisory agent of the ots  who can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
in connection with the filing of its periodic reports with the ots  the bank regularly reviews the problem loans in its portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations 
at december   the bank classified million of a million commercial real estate loan as loss and allocated million of its allowance for loan losses to a specific allowance against the loan 
at december   the remainder of non performing loans are classified as substandard

for the six months ended december   interest income on non accrual loans and troubled debt restructurings that was included in net income amounted to non performing commercial real estate  construction and land loans declined to million at december   from million at june  restructured or renegotiated loans decreased to zero 
the bank declassified a million commercial loan  due to cash flow improvements and continued compliance with its restructured terms 
in addition  the bank transferred a million second mortgage on a commercial real estate property into the non accrual category  after commencing foreclosure proceedings 
the bank s second mortgage of million is subordinate to a million industrial revenue bond 
the bank has issued a standby letter of credit against the industrial revenue bond  and will assume the responsibility for the bond payments upon obtaining title to the property 
this will increase the bank s investment in the property by million at that time 
the industrial revenue bond is current as to interest payments as of december   and carries an interest rate of 
the industrial revenue bond is assumable by any purchaser of the underlying collateral 
in conjunction with the reclassification of the second mortgage  the bank allocated million of its general allowance for loan losses into a specific allowance for loss on this loan 
management believes that the million specific allowance is adequate to absorb any potential loss on the first and second mortgages based on currently available information 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of its loan activity 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans of which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters  the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance 
the following table sets forth the bank s allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated 
the balances below represent general loan loss reserves and are not allocable to any one type of loan in the bank s loan portfolio  except for million at december   which is allocated as a specific reserve against a commercial real estate loan

assuming no significant adverse changes in existing market conditions  management anticipates charge offs in to increase moderately over historical amounts  due to an increase in overall delinquencies  and having the out of state purchased loan portfolio acquired in the nsbi merger for a full year in however  no assurances can be made that charge offs will not be less than or exceed this estimate if facts or circumstances change in the future 
at december   the bank s loan portfolio consists of of one to four family real estate loans  with an additional being equity lines of credit or home equity loans on one to four family real estate 
based on the bank s historical high asset quality  low charge off experience and concentration on one to four family lending in its market area  management considers the risk of loss due to these loans as minimal 
the remaining of the bank s portfolio  or million  consists of multi family mortgage  commercial real estate  construction  land  and other loans 
these loans generally tend to exhibit greater risk of loss than do one to four family loans  primarily because such loans typically carry higher loan balances and repayment is dependent  in large part  on sufficient income to cover operating expenses 
in addition  economic events and government regulations  which are outside the control of the bank and the borrower  could impact the security of the loan or the future cash flow of affected properties 
management has addressed these risks through its underwriting standards 
with respect to multi family loans  the bank has traditionally limited its lending to small apartment buildings  which management believes have lower risk than larger properties 
at december   in the bank s million multi family portfolio  only seven loans are on properties greater than units and the average multi family loan size is  in addition  almost all of the bank s construction and land loans are on one to four family residential property 
all of the bank s multi family  construction and land loans are secured by properties located in the chicago metropolitan area

deposits 
the bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
the bank s deposits consist of passbook accounts  now and checking accounts  money market and certificate accounts 
the bank only solicits deposits from its market area and does not use brokers to obtain deposits 
the bank relies primarily on competitive pricing policies  advertising  and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in money market and prevailing interest rates and competition 
the net increase in deposits during the six months ended december  is primarily due to interest credited to deposits  as outflows exceeded inflows during this period  primarily due to competitive pressure for certificate of deposits 
the large increase in deposits during the year ended june  was primarily due to the acquisition of nsbi  as well as the bank generating net deposit inflows of million 
the increase in deposits during the year ended june  was primarily due to interest credited to deposits  which offset savings outflows during that period

although deposits are the bank s primary source of funds  the bank s policy has been to utilize borrowings  such as advances from fhlb of chicago  and reverse repurchase agreements  when they are a less costly source of funds or can be invested at a positive rate of return 
the bank obtains advances from the fhlb of chicago upon the security of its capital stock in the fhlb of chicago and a blanket pledge of certain of its mortgage loans 
see regulation and supervision federal home loan bank system 
such advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs  each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
the maximum amount that the fhlb of chicago will advance to member institutions  including the bank  for purposes other than meeting withdrawals  fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the ots and the fhlb of chicago

subordinated capital notes 
in november   the company refinanced its million of subordinated capital notes due june  with million of subordinated notes due september  the payment of principal and interest on the current notes is subordinated at all times to any indebtedness or liability of the company outstanding or incurred after the date of issuance 
costs incurred in the refinance transaction amounted to million and are being accreted over the life of the notes yielding an effective interest rate of 
the capital notes are callable at the discretion of the company at any time after september   at par plus any accrued interest 
the indenture provides for restrictions on the amounts of additional indebtedness the company may incur as well as the amount of dividends and other distributions it may pay with respect to its equity securities  depending on the company s capital ratio 
the refinance transaction resulted in a  or per share extraordinary charge to earnings due to the early extinguishment of debt as a result of writing off the remaining unamortized transaction costs of  net of income taxes of  asset liability management the bank s overall asset liability management strategy is directed toward reducing the bank s exposure to interest rate risk over time in changing interest rate environments 
asset liability management is a daily function of the bank s management due to continual fluctuations in interest rates and financial markets 
as part of its asset liability strategy  the bank has implemented a policy to maintain its cumulative one year interest sensitivity gap ratio within a range of to of total assets  which helps the bank to maintain a more stable net interest rate spread in various interest rate environments 
the gap ratio fluctuates as a result of market conditions and management s expectation of future interest rate trends 
under ots thrift bulletin  the bank is required to measure its interest rate risk assuming various increases and decreases in general interest rates  and the effect on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity 
an interest rate risk policy has been approved by the board of directors setting the limits to changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity at the various rate scenarios required 
in addition  the ots has added an interest rate risk component to its regulatory capital requirements which could require an additional amount of capital based on the level of adverse change in a savings institution s market value of portfolio equity  resulting from changes in interest rates 
management continually reviews its interest rate risk policies in light of potentially higher capital requirements that could result from the adoption of an interest rate risk component to the ots capital requirements 
the bank s asset liability management strategy emphasizes the origination of one to four family adjustable rate loans and other loans which have shorter terms to maturity or reprice more frequently than fixed rate mortgage loans  yet  provide a positive margin over the bank s cost of funds 
in response to customer demand  the bank originates fixed rate mortgage loans  but has historically generally sold the conforming loans in the secondary market in order to maintain its interest rate sensitivity levels 
during the last six months  the bank has been retaining the majority of the retail fixed rate originations in portfolio for investment purposes to help utilize the bank s higher capital base resulting from the merger with nsbi 
in conjunction with the strategy discussed above  management has also hedged the bank s exposure to interest rate risk primarily by committing to sell fixed rate mortgage loans for future delivery 
under these commitments  the bank agrees to sell fixed rate loans at a specified price and at a specified future date 
the sale of fixed rate mortgage loans for future delivery has enabled the bank to continue to originate new mortgage loans  and to generate gains on sale of these loans as well as loan servicing fee income  while maintaining its gap ratio within the parameters discussed above 
most of these forward sale commitments are conducted with fnma and fhlmc with respect to loans that conform to the requirements of these government agencies 
the forward commitment of mortgage loans presents a risk to the bank if the bank is not able to deliver the mortgage loans by the commitment expiration date 
if this should occur  the bank would be required to pay a fee to the buyer 
the bank attempts to mitigate this risk by charging potential retail borrowers a fee to fix the interest rate  or by requiring the interest rate to float at market rates until shortly before closing 
in its wholesale lending operation  there is more risk due to the competitive inability to charge a rate lock fee to the mortgage brokers  which the bank tries to offset by using higher assumed fallout rates 
in addition  the bank uses us treasury bond futures contracts to hedge some of the mortgage pipeline exposure 
these futures contracts are used to hedge mortgage loan production in those circumstances where loans are not sold forward as described above 
the table below sets forth the scheduled repricing or maturity of the bank s assets and liabilities at december   based on the assumptions used by the fhlb of chicago with respect to now  checking and passbook account withdrawals as well as loan and mortgage backed securities prepayment percentages 
in a departure from the fhlb of chicago assumptions  which assume a prepayment for other borrowings  the bank assumes that the collateralized mortgage obligations included in other borrowings prepay at the same rate used for the mortgage backed securities collateralizing these obligations  while the nwac collateralized mortgage obligations are adjustable rate and included in the months or less category 
the effect of these assumptions is to quantify the dollar amount of items that are interest sensitive and may be repriced within each of the periods specified 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the bank s net interest yield because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other pressures beyond the bank s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes

the company s principal uses of funds are interest payments on the company s borrowed funds  cash dividends to shareholders  loans to and investments in maf developments  stock repurchases  as well as investment purchases with excess cash flow 
in addition  cash has been used to fund stock buyback programs as a means of reducing the number of shares outstanding 
during the past one and one half years  the company has repurchased  shares of its common stock for a total of million  including  shares for million which were owned by nsbi at the time the acquisition closed 
the company obtained a million unsecured term bank loan in conjunction with its acquisition of nsbi 
the loan provides for an interest rate of the prime rate or over one  two or three month libor at management s discretion adjustable and payable at the end of the repricing period 
the loan currently carries an interest rate of over three month libor 
the loan is convertible all or in part  with certain limitations at the end of any repricing period  at management s election to a fixed rate at over the us treasury rate with a maturity corresponding to the remaining term of the loan 
the loan requires increasing annual principal payments starting in december with million due at the final maturity of the loan on december  prepayments of principal are allowed  but fixed rate portions are subject to penalty 
in conjunction with the term bank loan  the company also maintains a million one year unsecured revolving line of credit which matured on january  the line of credit was extended to april   and it is expected that the lender will extend and renew the line annually thereafter 
the interest rate on the line of credit is the prime rate or over one  two  or three month libor  at management s discretion with interest payable at the end of the repricing period 
no amounts have been drawn on the line of credit 
the financing agreements contain covenants that  among other things  requires the company to maintain a minimum stockholders equity balance and to obtain certain minimum operating results  as well as requiring the bank to maintain well capitalized regulatory capital levels and certain non performing asset ratios 
in addition  the company has agreed not to pledge any stock of the bank or maf developments for any purpose 
at december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
during the six months ended december  and the year ended june   the company received cash dividends from the bank totaling and million  respectively 
the large increase in was due to the acquisition of nsbi 
after the acquisition was complete  the company received a million special dividend from the bank due to its overcapitalization for regulatory purposes from the merger with northwestern 
the company declared 
per share in cash dividends to common shareholders during the six months ended december   compared to 
per share in the year ended june  the bank s principal sources of funds are deposits  advances from the fhlb of chicago  reverse repurchase agreements  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds from the sale of loans and funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan and mortgage backed securities amortization and maturing interest bearing deposits are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are greatly influenced by economic conditions  the general level of interest rates and competition 
the bank utilizes particular sources of funds based on comparative costs and availability 
the bank generally manages the pricing of its deposits to maintain a steady deposit balance  but has from time to time decided not to pay rates on deposits as high as its competition  and when necessary  to supplement deposits with longer term and or less expensive alternative sources of funds  such as advances from the fhlb of chicago and reverse repurchase agreements 
during the six months ended december   the bank borrowed million net in fhlb of chicago advances and an additional million net  under reverse repurchase agreements to primarily fund mortgage loan volume held for investment by the bank 
the bank is required by regulation to maintain specific minimum levels of liquid investments 
regulations currently require the bank to maintain liquid assets at least equal to of the sum of its average daily balance of net withdrawable accounts and borrowed funds due in one year or less 
this regulatory requirement may be changed from time to time to reflect current economic conditions 
during the six months ended december   the bank s average liquidity ratio was 
at december   total liquidity was million  or  which was million in excess of the regulatory requirement 
this excess liquidity has provided the bank with the flexibility needed to maintain its short term gap ratios within strategic limits  as well as most recently  to fund the increased loan volume 
during the six months ended december   the bank originated and purchased loans totaling million compared to million for the six months ended december   and million during the year ended june  the bank has outstanding commitments to originate loans of million  purchase loans of million  and sell loans of million at december  the company expects to fund current and future loan commitments using principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  as well as outside funding sources

the hola prohibits a savings and loan holding company  directly or indirectly  or through one or more subsidiaries  from acquiring more than of the voting stock of another savings institution or holding company thereof  without prior written approval of the ots  acquiring or retaining  with certain exceptions  more than of a nonsubsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the hola  or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the fdic 
in evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions  the ots must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved  the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds  the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors 
the ots is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state  subject to two exceptions i the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies and ii the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions 
the states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions 
although savings and loan holding companies are not subject to specific capital requirements or specific restrictions on the payment of dividends or other capital distributions  hola does prescribe such restrictions on subsidiary savings institutions  as described below 
the bank must notify the ots days before declaring any dividend to the company 
in addition  the financial impact of a holding company on its subsidiary institution is a matter that is evaluated by the ots and the agency has authority to order cessation of activities or divestiture of subsidiaries deemed to pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the institution 
federal savings institution regulation capital requirements 
the ots capital regulations require savings institutions to meet three minimum capital standards a tangible capital ratio  a leverage core capital ratio and an risk based capital ratio 
in addition  the prompt corrective action standards discussed below also establish  in effect  a minimum tangible capital standard  a leverage core capital ratio for institutions receiving the highest rating on the camel financial institution rating system  and  together with the risk based capital standard itself  a tier i risk based capital standard 
core capital is defined as common stockholder s equity including retained earnings  certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less intangibles other than certain purchased mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships 
the ots regulations also require that  in meeting the leverage ratio  tangible and risk based capital standards  institutions must generally deduct investments in and loans to subsidiaries engaged in activities as principal that are not permissible for a national bank 
for the bank  this includes its million investment in mid america developments and nw financial at december   which the bank must deduct from regulatory capital for purposes of calculating its capital requirements 
the risk based capital standard for savings institutions requires the maintenance of tier i core and total capital which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital to risk weighted assets of and  respectively 
in determining the amount of risk weighted assets  all assets  including certain off balance sheet assets  are multiplied by a risk weight of to  as assigned by the ots capital regulation based on the risks ots believes are inherent in the type of asset 
the components of tier i core capital are equivalent to those discussed earlier 
the components of supplementary capital currently include cumulative preferred stock  long term perpetual preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock and the general allowance for loan losses  limited to a maximum of of risk weighted assets 
overall  the amount of supplementary capital included as part of total capital cannot exceed of core capital 
the ots regulatory capital requirements also incorporate an interest rate risk component 
savings institutions with above normal interest rate risk exposure are subject to a deduction from total capital for purposes of calculating their risk based capital requirements 
a savings institution s interest rate risk is measured by the decline in the net portfolio value of its assets ie  the difference between incoming and outgoing discounted cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts that would result from a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates divided by the estimated economic value of the institution s assets 
in calculating its total capital under the risk based capital rule  a savings institution whose measured interest rate risk exposure exceeds must deduct an amount equal to one half of the difference between the institution s measured interest rate risk and  multiplied by the estimated economic value of the institution s assets 
the director of the ots may waive or defer a savings institution s interest rate risk component on a case by case basis 
a savings institution with assets of less than million and risk based capital ratios in excess of is not subject to the interest rate risk component  unless the ots determines otherwise 
for the present time  the ots has deferred implementation of the interest rate risk component 
if the bank had been subject to an interest rate risk capital component as of december  and june   the bank s total risk weighted capital would not have been subject to a deduction based on interest rate risk 
at december  and june   the bank met each of its capital requirements on a fully phased in basis 
at december  and june   the bank was in compliance with the current capital requirements as follows december  june  percent of percent of amount assets amount assets dollars in thousands stockholder s equity of the bank   tangible capital   tangible capital requirement   excess   core capital   core capital requirement   excess   core and supplementary capital

under the ots prompt corrective action regulations  the ots is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions  the severity of which depends upon the institution s degree of undercapitalization 
generally  a savings institution is considered well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is at least  its ratio of tier i core capital to risk weighted assets is at least  its ratio of core capital to total assets is at least  and it is not subject to any order or directive by the ots to meet a specific capital level 
a savings institution generally is considered adequately capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is at least  its ratio of tier i core capital to risk weighted assets is at least  and its ratio of core capital to total assets is at least if the institution receives the highest camel rating 
a savings institution that has a ratio of total capital to weighted assets of less of than  a ratio of tier i core capital to risk weighted assets of less than or a ratio of core capital to total assets of less than or less for institutions with the highest examination rating is considered to be undercapitalized 
a savings institution that has a total risk based capital ratio less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio that is less than is considered to be significantly undercapitalized  and a savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than is deemed to be critically undercapitalized 
subject to a narrow exception  the banking regulator is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized 
the regulation also provides that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the ots within days of the date a savings institution receives notice that it is undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
compliance with the plan must be guaranteed by any parent holding company 
in addition  numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution  including  but not limited to  increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth  capital distributions and expansion 
the ots could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions  including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors 
insurance of deposit accounts 
the fdic has adopted a risk based deposit insurance system that assesses deposit insurance premiums according to the level of risk involved in an institution s activities 
an institution s risk category is based upon whether the institution is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized and one of three supervisory subcategories within each capital group 
the supervisory subgroup to which an institution is assigned is based on a supervisory evaluation and information which the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance fund 
based on its capital and supervisory subgroups  each bank insurance fund bif and saif member institution is assigned an annual fdic assessment rate  with an institution in the highest category ie  well capitalized and healthy receiving the lowest rates and an institution in the lowest category ie  undercapitalized and posing substantial supervisory concern receiving the highest rates 
the fdic has authority to further raise premiums if deemed necessary 
if such action is taken  it could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the bank 
on september   the president signed the deposit insurance funds act of the funds act  which  among other things  imposed a special one time assessment on saif members  including the bank  to recapitalize the saif 
as required by the funds act  the fdic imposed a special assessment of basis points on saif assessable deposits held as of march   payable november  the special assessment recorded by the bank amounted to million on a pre tax basis  and million on an after tax basis  and was reflected in the quarter ended september  the funds act also spreads the obligations for payment of the fico bonds across all saif and bif members 
beginning on january   bif deposits will be assessed for a fico payment of basis points  while saif deposits will pay basis points 
full pro rata sharing of the fico payments between bif and saif members will occur on the earlier of january  or the date the bif and saif are merged 
the funds act specifies that the bif and saif will be merged on january   provided no savings associations remain as of that time 
the bank s assessment rate for the six months ended december  ranged from to basis points and the premium paid for this period was million 
a significant increase in saif insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the bank 
under the fdi act  insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic or the ots 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
loans to one borrower 
under the hola  savings institutions are generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower applicable to national banks 
generally  savings institutions may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of of its unimpaired capital and surplus 
an additional amount may be lent  equal to of unimpaired capital and surplus  if such loan is secured by readily marketable collateral  which is defined to include certain financial instruments and bullion 
at december   the bank s limit on loans to one borrower was million 
at december   the bank s largest aggregate outstanding balance of loans to any one borrower was million 
qtl test 
the hola requires savings institutions to meet a qtl test 
under the qtl test  a savings and loan association is required to maintain at least of its portfolio assets total assets less i specified liquid assets up to of total assets  ii intangibles  including goodwill  and iii the value of property used to conduct business in certain qualified thrift investments primarily residential mortgages and related investments  including certain mortgage backed securities in at least months out of each month period 
a savings institution that fails the qtl test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a bank charter 
as of december   the bank maintained of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and  therefore  met the qtl test 
limitation on capital distributions 
ots regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by savings institutions  such as cash dividends  payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares  payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash out merger and other distributions charged against capital 
the rule establishes three tiers of institutions  which are based primarily on an institution s capital level 
an institution that exceeds all fully phased in capital requirements before and after a proposed capital distribution tier bank and has not been advised by the ots that it is in need of more than normal supervision  could  after prior notice but without obtaining approval of the ots  make capital distributions during a calendar year equal to the greater of i of its net earnings to date during the calendar year plus the amount that would reduce by one half its surplus capital ratio the excess capital over its fully phased in capital requirements at the beginning of the calendar year or ii of its net income for the previous four quarters 
any additional capital distributions would require prior regulatory approval 
in the event the bank s capital fell below its regulatory requirements or the ots notified it that it was in need of more than normal supervision  the bank s ability to make capital distributions could be restricted 
in addition  the ots could prohibit a proposed capital distribution by any institution  which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation  if the ots determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
at december   the bank is considered a tier bank 
liquidity 
the bank is required to maintain an average daily balance of specified liquid assets equal to a monthly average of not less than a specified percentage of its net withdrawable deposit accounts plus short term borrowings 
this liquidity requirement is currently but may be changed from time to time by the ots to any amount within the range of to depending upon economic conditions and the savings flows of member institutions 
ots regulations also require each member savings institution to maintain an average daily balance of short term liquid assets at a specified percentage currently of the total of its net withdrawable deposit accounts and borrowings payable in one year or less 
monetary penalties may be imposed for failure to meet these liquidity requirements 
the bank s liquidity and short term liquidity ratios for december  were and respectively  which exceeded the then applicable requirements 
the bank has never been subject to monetary penalties for failure to meet its liquidity requirements 
assessments 
savings institutions are required to pay assessments to the ots to fund the agency s operations 
the general assessment  paid on a semi annual basis  is computed upon the savings institution s total assets  including consolidated subsidiaries  as reported in the bank s latest quarterly thrift financial report 
the assessments paid by the bank for the six months ended december  totaled  branching 
ots regulations permit nationwide branching by federally chartered savings institutions to the extent allowed by federal statute 
this permits federal savings institutions to establish interstate networks and to geographically diversify their loan portfolios and lines of business 
the ots authority preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings institutions 
transactions with related parties 
the bank s authority to engage in transactions with related parties or affiliates eg  any company that controls or is under common control with an institution  including the company and its non savings institution subsidiaries is limited by sections a and b of the federal reserve act fra 
section a limits the aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate to of the capital and surplus of the savings institution 
the aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to of the savings institution s capital and surplus 
certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in section a  and the purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited 
section b generally provides that certain transactions with affiliates  including loans and asset purchases  must be on terms and under circumstances  including credit standards  that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non affiliated companies 
in addition  savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary 
the bank s authority to extend credit to executive officers  directors and shareholders  as well as entities such persons control  is governed by sections g and h of the fra and regulation o thereunder 
among other things  such loans are generally required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and to not involve more than the normal risk of repayment 
regulation o also places individual and aggregate limits on the amount of loans the bank may make to such persons based  in part  on the bank s capital position and requires certain board approval procedures to be followed 
enforcement 
under the fdi act  the ots has primary enforcement responsibility over savings institutions and has the authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution affiliated parties  including stockholders  and any attorneys  appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution 
formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and or directors to institution of proceedings for receivership  conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance 
civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and may amount to  per day  or even million per day in especially egregious cases 
under the fdi act  the fdic has the authority to recommend to the director of the ots enforcement action to be taken with respect to a particular savings institution 
if action is not taken by the director  the fdic has authority to take such action under certain circumstances 
federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations 
standards for safety and soundness 
the federal banking agencies have adopted interagency guidelines prescribing standards for safety and soundness guidelines and a final rule to implement safety and soundness standards required under the fdi act 
the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
the standards set forth in the guidelines address internal controls and information systems  internal audit system  credit underwriting  loan documentation  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings and compensation  fees and benefits 
if the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines  the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard  as required by the fdi act 
the final rule establishes deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans when such plans are required 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the fhlb system  which consists of regional fhlbs 
the fhlb provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions 
the bank  as a member of the fhlb of chicago  is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in that fhlb in an amount at least equal to of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year  or of its advances borrowings from the fhlb chicago  whichever is greater 
at december   the bank was in compliance with this requirement  with an investment in fhlb of chicago stock of million 
fhlb of chicago advances must be secured by specified types of collateral and may be obtained primarily for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance 
the fhlbs are required to provide funds to cover certain obligations on bonds issued to fund the resolution of insolvent thrifts and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs 
these requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the fhlbs pay to their members and could also result in the fhlbs imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members 
for the six months ended december   and the years ended june  and  dividends from the fhlb of chicago to the bank amounted to million  million and  respectively 
if fhlb dividends were reduced  or interest on future fhlb advances increased  the bank s net interest income might also be reduced 
federal reserve system the federal reserve board regulations require savings institutions to maintain non interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts primarily now and regular checking accounts 
the federal reserve board regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows for accounts aggregating million or less subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board the reserve requirement is  and for accounts greater than million  the reserve requirement is million plus subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board between and against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of million 
the first million of otherwise reservable balances subject to adjustments by the federal reserve board are exempted from the reserve requirements 
the bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements 
the balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the federal reserve board may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the ots
