a majority of the company s revenues have been historically generated from software development activities 
software development revenues are primarily recognized on the percentage of completion method  which requires revenues to be recorded over the term of a client contract based on the percentage of work performed 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates of the percentage of work completed is reflected in the fiscal quarter in which the changes become known 
the company s operating results may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates of contract completion costs 
although the company from time to time is required to make revisions to its work completion estimates  to date  none of such revisions has had a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance of the accuracy of the company s future work completion estimates 
losses expected to be incurred on projects in progress are recognized when known 
revenues related to time and materials engagements are recognized when services are performed 
a major portion of the company s services are provided on a fixed price basis and  therefore  the company bears the risk of cost overruns and inflation 
client project margins and personnel utilization are critical components of the company s financial performance 
the company regularly reviews staff compensation and overhead costs to ensure that its consulting and software development services are properly priced 
in addition  senior management monitors the progress of client projects on a monthly basis 
the company attempts to manage its personnel utilization rates by closely monitoring project timetables and staffing requirements for new projects 
because the company s client engagements are generally terminable without client penalty  an unanticipated termination of a client project could require the company to maintain or terminate under utilized employees  resulting in a higher than expected number of unassigned persons or higher severance expenses 
while the level of professional staff must be adjusted to reflect active projects  the company must maintain a sufficient number of senior professionals to oversee existing client projects and participate with the company s sales force in securing new client assignments

the company expects that cash flows from operations will provide the principal source of future liquidity for the company

the company currently anticipates that existing cash and investment balances combined with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the facility will be sufficient  at least through  to meet the company s short term and long term working capital requirements and to fund the expansion of the company s business 
in order to meet client demand for the company s services in  the company expects to continue to increase its professional staff and to open additional sales and operations offices in north america  latin america  europe  and the pacific rim 
although the company s plans to open offices and hire personnel are driven in response to increased demand for the company s information technology consulting and management consulting  and software deployment services  a portion of these expenses will be incurred in anticipation of increased demand 
operating results and liquidity may be adversely affected if market demand and revenues do not increase as anticipated 
as the company expands its international operations  a number of factors  including market acceptance of the company s services  significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and changes in general economic conditions could also adversely affect future results and liquidity 
this form k includes forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties  particularly as to net revenues and profits  capital expenditures  future liquidity needs  working capital needs and project personnel costs  general and administrative expenses  sales and marketing expenses  and other costs as a percentage of net revenues 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
while it is impossible to identify each factor and event that could affect the company s results  variations in the company s revenues and operating results occur from time to time as a result of a number of factors  such as the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during the year  the number of working days in a year  employee hiring and utilization rates  acceptance and profitability of the company s services in new territories  and integration of companies acquired 
the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because the company s sales cycle is relatively long in the case of new clients and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of the assignments and general economic conditions 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments  particularly at or near the end of any year  can cause significant variations in operating results from year to year
