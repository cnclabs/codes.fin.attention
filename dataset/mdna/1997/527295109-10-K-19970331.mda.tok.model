item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception  the company has designed  developed and marketed application specific standard integrated circuit products assps and custom derivatives for the transmission and networking markets 
volume shipments of its initial assps began in since that time  the company has experienced significant increases in sales as its mixed signal integrated circuits have gained market acceptance 
the company s annual revenue compound growth rate has been since the company first achieved profitable operations in the quarter ended march  and has been profitable in each subsequent quarter 
the company derives revenues principally from product sales 
in addition  the company has received non recurring engineering and licensing revenue from strategic partners and customers in connection with product development projects 
as a result of those and other transactions  the company receives royalties and license fees 
the company s cost of sales includes the costs of wafer fabrication and assembly performed by third party vendors  and costs associated with the procurement  scheduling  testing and quality assurance functions performed by the company 
research and development expenses associated with non recurring engineering contracts are expensed as incurred  while the related revenue is recognized only as contract milestones are completed 
this document includes forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results of the company s activities may differ significantly from the potential results discussed in such forward looking statements 
risk factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those factors identified below and under the caption factors that may affect future results 
results of operations revenues revenues for increased to million from million in and million in the continued growth in revenues is due to the successful introduction of new products and increased sales of existing products to customers in the company s two target market segments transmission and networking 
in  sales to hewlett packard were of total sales 
in and  no single customer accounted for more than of revenues 
export sales  primarily consisting of sales to canada  europe  and asia  were of revenues in  in and in all sales were in us dollars  thereby eliminating any foreign currency impact on revenues and net income 
the increase in international sales is attributable to increased sales to foreign manufacturing facilities and subcontractors of domestic customers and the company s increased international marketing and sales efforts  including establishment of sales and sales support personnel in foreign countries 
royalties  licenses and non recurring engineering revenue the company has entered into development agreements with certain customers relating to customer specific applications  as well as  license agreements with certain semiconductor manufacturers 
revenue is not recognized for non recurring engineering nre contracts until contract milestones are met  although expenditures associated with the contract are expensed as incurred 
during  the company had  in revenues from nre contracts versus  in and  in in  the company received royalties of  from products sold by licensees 
in and  royalties were  and  respectively 
the company believes future revenue growth will depend on the success and timing of new products along with continued sales growth of existing products 
new products are generally incorporated into a customer s product or system at the design stage 
however  design wins may precede volume sales by a year or more 
no assurance can be given that any design win will result in future revenues 
gross margin the following table sets forth the company s product sales and product gross margin dollars in thousands product sales    cost of product sales    gross margin    gross margin product sales 
product gross margin is affected by several factors  including average selling prices  the mix between older and newer products  test equipment utilization  foundry manufacturing yields  timing of cost reductions and the mix between direct and distributor sales 
margins on domestic and international sales are similar 
beginning in  certain engineering costs associated with product cost reduction efforts were more appropriately allocated to cost of product sales rather than research and development 
this caused margins to decline by approximately percentage points in  while reducing research and development expense a similar amount 
there was no net impact on operating profit 
research and development research and development r d expenses were million in  million in and million in as a percent of revenues  r d expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
in  r d expense included a one time charge for purchased research and development of million related to the acquisition of silicon design experts  inc in  r d expense included a one time charge for purchased research and development of  associated with the acquisition of san francisco telecom  inc excluding one time charges  r d expense as percent of revenues was and for and  respectively 
as previously stated in the gross margin section  in the company began accounting for engineering costs associated with product cost reduction efforts in cost of product sales  rather than r d 
in  these costs were approximately of revenues 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in as a percent of revenue  sales and marketing expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and million in as a percentage of revenue  expenses decreased to in  from and in and  respectively 
the expense increases in dollars are primarily attributable to additional headcount and associated expenses due to the company s growth 
interest and other income the company earns interest on its cash and investments and incurs interest expense on lease obligations used to finance certain capital equipment 
income for was million versus million in and million in in  other income included a one time gain of  from the sale of a portion of the company s investment in maker communications

the expenditures in each year consisted primarily of equipment used for designing and testing products 
of the total capital expenditures  million in  million in  and million  were financed by capital leases 
the company s current wafer requirements are supplied primarily by six foundries 
during  the company entered into five year agreements with three of its suppliers for committed foundry capacity in consideration of equipment financing or cash deposits 
during and  the company provided an aggregate of million in capital equipment financing and or cash deposits to these three foundries in connection with such activities 
the company has remaining funding commitments not to exceed  the company expects to finance its capital equipment requirements using a combination of cash and equipment leasing 
the company believes that its existing cash resources  combined with cash generated from operations  equipment lease management  and its line of credit will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements through the end of however  the company may from time to time seek additional equity or debt financing as a result of the capital intensive nature of the semiconductor industry
