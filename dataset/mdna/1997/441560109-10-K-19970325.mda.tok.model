impact of inflation and changing prices although inflation is currently well below that of prior years  which has benefited recent company results  particularly in the area of manufacturing costs  there are offsetting costs 
the company s ability to adjust selling prices always has been limited by competitive factors and long term contractual arrangements which either prohibit price increases or limit the amount by which prices may be increased 
if there were to be a weak domestic economy at a time of low inflation  there could be lower tax receipts at the state and local level  and the funding and buying patterns for textbooks and other educational materials could be adversely affected 
in  the company started to experience higher prices for paper goods which continued into however  this trend did not continue in  as the company experienced a moderation in prices for paper products 
the most significant company investments affected by inflation include book plates  other property  plant  and equipment and inventories

management believes that by valuing its inventory using the lifo method  continuing to emphasize technological improvements  and quality control  the company can continue to moderate the impact of inflation on its operating results and financial position
