item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sync commenced operations in and funded operations through with revenue from communications software consulting and custom product development for equipment vendors and large end users 
the company shipped its first commercial wan product in in  sync released its first conversionnode and frame relay access products 
the company expanded its operations in late and in anticipation of an expanding market for sync s wan access products 
the company implemented a work force reduction in late  when the market for the company s products was slower to develop than expected and when anticipated increased sales were not realized 
the company continued its historical emphasis on identifying potential channel partners  educating potential and existing channel partners and other resellers and supporting sales efforts of these resellers 
as a result of these activities  in and early  the company entered into relationships with several additional channel partners 
sales through channel partners and other resellers increased as the market for the company s products began to grow significantly in the company currently maintains oem  marketing and sales arrangements with communications and networking companies such as ibm and com  as well as carriers such as sprint  mci  ameritech  pacbell and compuserve 
in the first half of  the company added significant senior management personnel 
in addition  in order to support the anticipated growth in its business  the company began expanding its operations and increased its manufacturing capacity through the expansion of its relationships with contract manufacturers and internal manufacturing resources 
on august   sync acquired tylink  pursuant to a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company with and into tylink 
in the merger  the company exchanged  shares of its common stock for all of the outstanding shares of tylink common and series a preferred stock and reserved  shares of sync common stock for issuance upon exercise of tylink options  which were assumed by the company 
in addition  sync acquired all of the issued and outstanding tylink series b preferred stock for million in cash and  shares of sync common stock 
the merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  the accompanying financial statements reflect the combination of sync and tylink for all periods presented 
on march   the company announced that it expects to implement significant expense reductions with the goal of enabling the company to achieve profitability at lower revenue levels 
there can be no assurance that sync s products will achieve significant market penetration  either through its channel partners and other resellers or its direct sales force  or that the company will successfully introduce new and enhanced products or compete effectively in its market  or that its efforts to implement expense reductions will enable it to become profitable at lower revenue levels  if at all 
risk factors the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of specifically  the company wishes to alert readers that  except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion under results of operations  recent results  inflation  and liquidity and capital resources constitutes forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
such risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to fluctuations in quarterly orders  market conditions in the networking industry and extraordinary charges relating to expense reductions 
history of losses  significant fluctuations in operating results  uncertain profitability the company has experienced operating losses since inception  with  in recent years  operating losses of million in  million in and million in as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the company has experienced  and may in the future experience  significant fluctuations in revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to a combination of factors 
factors that have in the past caused  or may in the future cause  the company s revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period include the timing of significant orders  the relatively long length of the sales cycles for certain of the company s products  the market conditions in the networking industry  the rate at which tylink operations become integrated with sync operations  the timing of capital expenditures by sync s target market customers  competition and pricing in the industry  the company s success in developing  introducing and shipping new products  new product introductions by the company s competitors  announcements by ibm relating to products  services or pricing relevant to the company  the rate of migration of large ibm customers to frame relay  production or quality problems  changes in material costs  disruption in sources of supply  and general economic conditions 
in addition  revenues and gross margins may fluctuate due to the mix of distribution channels employed and the mix of products sold 
for example  the company generally realizes a higher gross margin on direct sales than on sales through its channel partners and other resellers 
accordingly  as channel partners and other resellers continue to account for a substantial majority of the company s net revenues  gross profit as a percentage of net revenues may decline 
the company s future revenues are difficult to predict 
revenues and operating results in any quarter depend on the volume and timing of  and the ability to fulfill  orders received within the quarter 
sales of the company s products typically involve a sales cycle of several months or over a year from the point of initial customer contact until receipt of the first system order  and  in addition  the company has in the past encountered  and may in the future encounter  subsequent delays between initial orders and network wide deployment 
there can be no assurance that average sales cycles will not increase in future periods 
further  due to the company s focus on its channel partner marketing strategy  the company s revenues in any period are highly dependent upon the sales efforts and success of sync s channel partners and other resellers  which are not within the control of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s channel partners and other resellers will give a high priority to the marketing of the company s products as compared to competitive products or alternative networking solutions or that sync s channel partners and other resellers will continue to offer the company s products 
a significant portion of the company s expenses are relatively fixed in advance  based in large part on the company s forecasts of future sales 
if sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse effect of a shortfall in sales on the company s operating results may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust spending to compensate for such shortfall 
the company has in the past and may in the future reduce prices or increase spending to respond to competition or to pursue new product or market opportunities 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attain or sustain profitability on a quarterly or an annual basis 
in addition  if the company s operating results fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on the ibm customer base the company s products are targeted at the large installed base of ibm customers utilizing sna networks 
thus  the company faces the risks associated with a relatively concentrated customer base  including the possibility that larger ibm customers may migrate to frame relay at a slower than expected rate  if at all  and the possibility that ibm customers may purchase ibm sponsored frame relay products other than sync products 
there can be no assurance that ibm will continue to support frame relay  that ibm will not develop or promote sna over frame relay products competitive with the company s products  that the relationship between the company and ibm will be successful  that ibm will not terminate the relationship or that ibm will not endorse the products of competitors or networking solutions not offered by the company 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
uncertain market acceptance of frame relay for mission critical applications the growth in the company s net revenues in fiscal relative to fiscal was due in part to growth in sales of sync s frame relay access products  which enable sna and client server internetworking over frame relay 
the market for sna over frame relay products is relatively new and still evolving 
the success of the company and its channel partners in generating significant sales of frame relay access products will depend in part on their ability to educate end users about the benefits of the company s technology and convince end users to switch their mission critical applications to frame relay 
in addition  broad acceptance of frame relay services will also depend upon the tariffs for such services  which are determined by carriers 
if the tariff structure for dedicated leased lines becomes more favorable relative to tariffs for a comparable network utilizing frame relay  the market for frame relay networking products could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the market will adopt frame relay for mission critical applications to any significant extent 
the failure of such adoption to occur could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with acquisition of tylink corporation in august  the company acquired tylink 
in integrating the personnel and operations of sync and tylink  the company faces certain risks  including the risk that the operations and personnel of tylink will not be successfully assimilated into the company s business on a timely basis  or at all 
other risks associated with the merger include the possible loss of key personnel of either tylink or sync  potential disruption of the respective ongoing businesses of tylink and the company  the inability of the company s management to maximize the financial and strategic position of the combined entity through successful incorporation of tylink s personnel and clients  the inability to implement uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies and the impairment of relationships with existing employees and clients as a result of the company s integration of new management personnel 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
uncertain market acceptance of the company s products  product concentration the company currently derives substantially all of its revenues from its frame relay access  circuit management  transmission and other products and expects that revenues from these products will continue to account for substantially all of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
broad market acceptance of  and continuing demand for  these products  is  therefore  critical to the company s future success 
factors that may affect the market acceptance of the company s products include the extent to which frame relay is adopted for mission critical applications  the availability and price of competing products and technologies  announcements by ibm relating to products  services or pricing relevant to the company  the success of the sales efforts of the company and its resellers and tariff rates for carrier services 
moreover  the company s operating history in the wan internetworking market and its resources are limited relative to those of certain of its current and potential competitors 
the company s future performance will also depend in part on the successful development  introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products 
failure of the company s products to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on channel partners and other resellers the company s channel partners and other resellers account  and are expected to continue to account  for a substantial majority of the company s net revenues  including virtually all of its sales outside of the united states 
sales through channel partners and other resellers accounted for   and of net revenues of the company in  and  respectively 
the company currently maintains oem  marketing and sales arrangements with communications and networking companies such as ibm and com  as well as carriers such as sprint  pacbell  compuserve  ameritech and mci 
the company s agreements with its channel partners and other resellers do not restrict the sale of products that compete with those of the company 
in addition  these agreements generally provide for discounts based on expected or actual volumes of products purchased or resold by the reseller in a given period  do not require minimum purchases  prohibit distribution of certain products by the company through certain categories of third parties under certain conditions and provide manufacturing rights and access to source code upon the occurrence of specified conditions or defaults 
certain of the company s channel partners offer alternative solutions  designed by themselves or third parties  for sna internetworking or have pre existing relationships with current or potential competitors of the company 
certain of the company s channel partners have in the past developed competitive products and terminated their relationships with the company  and such developments could occur in the future 
many of the company s resellers offer competitive products manufactured either by third parties or by themselves 
for example  both net and racal  which accounted for  respectively  and of the company s net revenues in  have developed competitive products and product strategies 
moreover  the product lines acquired in the tylink merger compete with certain racal products 
thus  sync expects product revenues from net and racal to decline over the next year 
sales to com accounted for  and of net revenues of the company in  and  respectively 
the company believes the relative amount of revenues derived from sales to com will likely decline as competitive products impact the conversion product business 
during  sales to cabletron accounted for of net revenues of the company  but sales to cabletron have declined substantially  to of net revenues of the company in  and there can be no assurance that sales to cabletron will increase in the future 
the company generally realizes a higher gross margin on direct sales than on sales through its channel partners and other resellers 
accordingly  as channel partners and other resellers continue to account for a substantial majority of the company s net revenues  gross profit as a percentage of net revenues may decline 
each of the company s channel partners or other resellers can cease marketing the company s products at the reseller s option  under certain conditions  with limited notice and with little or no penalty 
there can be no assurance that the company will retain its current channel partners or other resellers or that it will be able to recruit additional or replacement channel partners 
the loss of one or more of the company s channel partners or other resellers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s channel partners and other resellers will give priority to the marketing of the company s products as compared to competitive products or alternative networking solutions or that sync s channel partners and other resellers will continue to offer the company s products 
any reduction or delay in sales of the company s products by its channel partners could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
rapid technological change and new products the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the company s success will depend to a substantial degree upon its ability to develop and introduce in a timely fashion enhancements to its existing products and new products that meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new products successfully  that such new products will gain market acceptance or that the company will be able to respond effectively to technological changes  emerging industry standards or product announcements by competitors 
in addition  the company has on occasion experienced delays in the introduction of product enhancements and new products 
there can be no assurance that in the future the company will be able to introduce product enhancements or new products on a timely basis 
further  from time to time  the company may announce new products  capabilities or technologies that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of the company s existing product offerings 
there can be no assurance that announcements of product enhancements or new product offerings will not cause customers to defer purchasing existing company products or cause resellers to return products to the company 
failure to introduce new products or product enhancements effectively and on a timely basis  customer delays in purchasing products in anticipation of new product introductions and any inability of the company to respond effectively to technological changes  emerging industry standards or product announcements by competitors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
product errors products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected software or hardware errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
such errors have occurred in the past  and there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments 
moreover  there can be no assurance that once detected  such errors can be corrected in a timely manner  if at all 
software errors may take several months to correct  if they can be corrected at all  and hardware errors may take even longer to rectify 
the occurrence of such software or hardware errors  as well as any delay in correcting them  could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of the company s products  additional warranty expense  diversion of engineering and other resources from the company s product development efforts or the loss of credibility with sync s channel partners and other resellers  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
intense competition the market for communications products is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change and emerging industry standards 
the company s current competitors include internetworking companies  such as cisco and bay networks  frad providers  such as hypercom  motorola isg and netlink  which was recently acquired by cabletron  and circuit management providers such as visual networks and frontier software 
competitors for the tylink group of digital transmission products include digital link  racal  at t paradyne and adtran  among others 
potential competitors include other internetworking and wan access and transmission companies  frame relay switch providers  ibm and the company s other channel partners 
certain of these companies have recently announced products and intentions to enter the frame relay access or circuit management market 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base  than does the company 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products than the company 
many also have long standing customer relationships with large enterprises that are part of the company s target market  and these relationships may make it more difficult to complete sales of the company s products to these enterprises 
further  certain of the company s channel partners have in the past developed competitive products and terminated their relationships with the company  and such developments could occur in the future 
as a consequence of all these factors  the company expects increased competition  particularly in the frame relay market 
increased competition could result in significant price competition  reduced profit margins or loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
dependence on contract manufacturers the company s manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials planning and procurement  light assembly  system integration  testing and quality assurance 
the company entered into an arrangement with a contract manufacturer in to outsource substantial portions of its procurement  assembly and system integration operations 
the company has recently contracted with a second supplier to diversify purchasing commitments while maintaining the outsource strategy 
there can be no assurance that these independent contract manufacturers will be able to meet the company s future requirements for manufactured products or that such independent contract manufacturers will not experience quality problems in manufacturing the company s products 
the inability of the company s contract manufacturers to provide the company with adequate supplies of high quality products could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the loss of any of the company s contract manufacturers could cause a delay in sync s ability to fulfill orders while the company identifies a replacement manufacturer 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s manufacturing procedures may in certain instances create a risk of excess or inadequate inventory if orders do not match forecasts 
the company increased manufacturing capacity in and through the expansion of its relationships with contract manufacturers and internal manufacturing resources 
any manufacturing delays  excess manufacturing capacity or inventories or inability to increase manufacturing capacity  if required  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on suppliers certain key components used in the manufacture of the company s products are currently purchased only from single or limited sources 
at present  single sourced components include programmable integrated circuits  selected other integrated circuits and cables  custom molded plastics and custom tooled sheet metal  and limited sourced components include flash memories  drams  printed circuit boards and selected integrated circuits 
the company generally relies upon contract manufacturers to buy component parts that are incorporated into board assemblies 
the company buys directly final assembly parts  such as plastics and metal covers  cables and other parts used in final configurations 
the company generally does not have long term agreements with any of these single or limited sources of supply 
any loss in a supplier  increase in required lead times  increase in price of component parts  interruption in the supply of any of these components  or the inability of the company to procure these components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
if orders do not match forecasts  the company may have excess or inadequate inventory of certain materials and components  and suppliers may demand longer lead times  higher prices or termination of contracts 
from time to time the company has experienced shortages of certain components and has paid above market prices to acquire such components on an accelerated basis or has experienced delays in fulfilling orders while waiting to obtain the necessary components 
such shortages may occur in the future and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on and risks associated with international sales sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues in  and  respectively 
however  these percentages may understate sales of the company s products to international end users because certain of the company s us based channel partners market the company s products abroad 
in addition  the company currently anticipates that international sales may increase as a percentage of the company s net revenues in future periods 
historically  the company s international sales have been conducted primarily through independent country specific distributors 
the company intends to market its products in foreign countries in the future increasingly through its channel partners 
failure of these resellers to market the company s products internationally or the loss of any of these resellers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company s ability to increase sales of its products to international end users may be limited if the carrier services  such as frame relay  or protocols supported by the company s products are not widely adopted internationally 
a number of additional risks are inherent in international transactions 
the company s international sales currently are us dollar denominated 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make the company s products less competitive in international markets 
international sales may also be limited or disrupted by the imposition of governmental controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  currency exchange fluctuations  political instability  trade restrictions and changes in tariffs 
in addition  sales in europe and certain other parts of the world typically are adversely affected in the third quarter of each year as many customers and end users reduce their business activities during the summer months 
these international factors could have a material adverse effect on future sales of the company s products to international end users and  consequently  the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on proprietary technology the company s future success depends  in part  upon its proprietary technology 
the company does not hold any patents and currently relies on a combination of contractual rights  trade secrets and copyright laws to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
in the event that protective measures are not successful  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the company is also subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future with respect to the company s current or future products or that any such claims will not require the company to enter into license arrangements or result in litigation  regardless of the merits of such claims 
no assurance can be given that any necessary licenses will be available or that  if available  such licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
should litigation with respect to any such claims commence  such litigation could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition regardless of the outcome of such litigation 
tariff and regulatory matters rates for public telecommunications services  including features and capacity of such services  are governed by tariffs determined by carriers and subject to regulatory approval 
future changes in these tariffs could have a material effect on the company s business 
for example  should tariffs for frame relay services increase in the future relative to tariffs for dedicated leased lines  the cost effectiveness of the company s products could be reduced  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company s products must meet industry standards and receive certification for connection to certain public telecommunications networks prior to their sale 
in the united states  the company s products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and underwriters laboratories 
internationally  the company s products must comply with standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries as well as with recommendations of the consultative committee on international telegraph and telephony 
in addition  carriers require that equipment connected to their networks comply with their own standards  which in part reflect their currently installed equipment 
some public carriers have installed equipment that does not fully comply with current industry standards  and this noncompliance must be addressed in the design of the company s products 
any future inability to obtain on a timely basis or retain domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certifications or to comply with existing or evolving industry standards could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company s success depends  to a significant degree  upon the continued contributions of its key management  sales  marketing  research and development and manufacturing personnel 
six of the eight current executive officers joined the company since january  and thus the management team is still relatively new 
the company maintains a key person life insurance policy only on john h 
rademaker  the company s chief executive officer 
the company believes its future success will also depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel  and development engineers 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
on march   the company announced that it expects to implement significant expense reductions with the goal of enabling the company to achieve profitability at lower revenues 
these expense reductions are expected to include a reduction in force 
the loss of the services of any of the company s key personnel or the failure to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
general economic conditions demand for the company s products depends in large part on the overall demand for communications and networking products  which has in the past and may in the future fluctuate significantly based on numerous factors  including capital spending levels and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience a decline in demand for its products due to general economic conditions 
any such decline could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
volatility of stock price factors such as announcements of technological innovations or the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  as well as market conditions in the technology sector  may have a significant effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
further  the stock market has experienced volatility which has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies and which often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these market fluctuations may have an adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock 
anti takeover provisions the company is subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  an anti takeover law 
in addition  certain provisions of the company s charter documents  including provisions eliminating cumulative voting  eliminating the ability of stockholders to take actions by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice  may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or management of the company  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
certain of the company s stock option and purchase plans provide for assumption of such plans  or  alternatively  immediate vesting upon a change of control or similar event 
in addition  the company has entered into severance agreements with its officers  pursuant to which they are entitled to specified severance payments if they are actually or constructively terminated within specified time periods following a change of control of the company 
the board of directors has authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of these shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of the common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
furthermore  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights senior to the common stock  and as a result  the issuance of such preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
the company has no present plan to issue shares of preferred stock 
results of operations comparison of and results net revenues 
the company derives its revenues primarily from sales of advanced wide area networking products  which are recognized upon shipment 
the company generally does not have any significant remaining obligations upon shipment of its products 
product returns and sales allowances are provided for at the date of sale 
service revenues from customer maintenance fees for ongoing customer support and product updates  which have not been material to date  are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period  which is typically months 
net revenues in were million  an increase of from the net revenues of million in the higher net revenues in reflected increased sales of frame relay access products and management products  partially offset by lower sales of the older conversion products and lower average selling prices 
net revenues from sales of frame relay access products were million in  as compared to million in the increase in net revenues from frame relay access products reflected the full year impact of the company s new product  which was introduced in the last quarter of  and overall growth in the frame relay access market 
net revenues from sales of management products were million in  as compared to million in  primarily due to increased acceptance of the company s snmp and circuit management products  which were introduced by tylink in july the percentage of net revenues represented by sales through channel partners and other resellers declined to in versus in sales of the company s frame relay access products represented approximately of total net revenues for  as compared to for sales of the company s management products represented of net revenues for  as compared to of net revenues for sales of the company s transmission products represented of net revenues for  or slightly above the of net revenues in sales of all other products and services declined to of net revenues in versus of net revenues for  as sales of older conversion products significantly declined 
the company expects that average selling prices will continue to decline and that sales through channel partners and other resellers will continue to account for a substantial majority of net revenues  however  the mix of sales among channel partners and other resellers may change from period to period 
sales of frame relay access products and circuit management products are expected to grow as a percentage of net revenues and transmission and other products revenues are expected to decline as a percentage of net revenues 
international sales accounted for of net revenues in  as compared to of net revenues in the company expects that international sales may increase as a percentage of net revenues in gross profit 
cost of sales primarily consists of purchased materials used in the assembly of the company s products and compensation paid to employees in the company s manufacturing organization 
gross profit decreased to million for from million in due primarily to lower average selling prices  especially in transmission products  which faced severe price pressure in the marketplace  and lower margins earned on increased sales of frame relay access products 
these frame relay access products were sold through channel partners and other resellers  and thus typically have lower margins than direct sales 
the decrease in gross profit in was partially offset by decreases in manufacturing costs 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december   due primarily to increases in the percentage of sales of frame relay access products through channel partners and resellers and lower average selling prices  partially offset by decreases in manufacturing costs 
operating expenses 
research and development expenses primarily consist of compensation paid to personnel  including consultants  engaged in research and development  amounts paid for outside development services  costs of materials utilized in the development of hardware products  including prototype units  and license fees and other payments to acquire rights to technology 
the company expenses all research and development costs as incurred 
research and development costs increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increased expenses in were primarily due to the addition of personnel for the development of new products and the continued enhancement of existing products 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of base and incentive compensation paid to sales and marketing personnel  travel and related expenses  and costs associated with promotional and trade show activities 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increased expenses principally reflected increased hiring and personnel related expenses associated with the build up of the company s sales organization 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation paid to administrative personnel  payments to consultants and professional service providers  and costs incurred in recruiting senior management personnel 
general and administrative expenditures increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increased expenses were primarily due to million in expenditures incurred in connection with the merger of sync and tylink  increased administrative personnel costs  and costs related to public company and investor relation activities since the company completed its initial public offering in november the company recorded deferred compensation of  during for the difference between the option exercise price or restricted stock price and the deemed fair value of the company s common stock for options granted and restricted stock sold in the deferred compensation is being amortized to operating expense and cost of sales over the related month vesting period of the shares and will  therefore  continue to have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
included in operating expenses and cost of sales for the year ended december  were  of such expenses  as compared to  for the year ended december  net interest income was million for the year ended december   as compared to million in the year ended december   as a result of significantly higher cash balances from the company s initial public offering in november income taxes 
the provisions for income taxes in and represent minimum state taxes and federal and state minimum taxes  respectively 
comparison of and results net revenues 
net revenues in were million  an increase of from the net revenues of million in the higher net revenues in reflected increased market acceptance of the company s newer frame relay access and conversion products  the initial sales of the new snmp and circuit management products and overall growth in sales through channel partners and other resellers  offset in part by lower average selling prices 
net revenues from sales of frame relay access and conversion products were million in  as compared to million in net revenues from sales of management products were million in there were no sales of these products in net revenues from sales of the company s older transmission products  which faced severe price competition in  were million in  as compared to million in the percentage of net revenues represented by sales through channel partners and other resellers increased to in versus in net revenues from sales of all other products and services increased to million in versus million in  primarily reflecting an increase in sales of conversion products to com in international sales accounted for of net revenues in  as compared to of net revenues in gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for from million in  due primarily to significantly increased sales volume  which was partially offset by lower average selling prices 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in  as compared to in  due primarily to increases in the percentage of sales of frame relay access products to channel partners and resellers and lower average selling prices  partially offset by lower manufacturing costs 
operating expenses
