revenue generated by the diagnostic laboratory division increased by in local currency terms  including a revenue increase for the swiss operations only  as a result of additional specimen volume of and an increase attributable to test mix of 
revenue generated by the uk diagnostic laboratory division also increased due to additional revenue primarily resulting from an existing government contract 
spanish operations almost doubled their revenues due to an increased market share 
the clinical trials division increased its revenues to million a increase due to the development of a new client base 
operating income for the year ended may  decreased by million including the effect of the change in the us dollar exchange rate of million versus the prior year 
three major components of the decrease are non cash charges totaling million a the write down of goodwill in one of the uk subsidiaries of million  b a revision of the estimated useful life of goodwill producing an additional charge of million  and c the write down in the carrying value of the uk property of million 
during the year  management performed its periodic evaluation of the company s goodwill  based on undiscounted expected future cash flows 
as a result thereof  in view of unexpected delays in returning uk operations to a level of profitability meeting the company s criteria  and in view of the present and estimated future cash flows of such operations  management recorded a charge to adjust such goodwill to its estimated fair value 
further  the company revised its estimate of the useful life of the company s goodwill to years 
further  as a result of its strategic decision to sell the company s building used by its uk operations  management reconsidered the carrying value of such building in light of current real estate market conditions  and the company therefore recorded a charge of million to adjust such carrying value to its estimated fair market value 
excluding the effect of the above items  the diagnostic laboratory division increased operating income by in local currency terms  whereas in dollar terms operating income decreased by million because of the effect of the fluctuation of the dollar million with respect to other currencies 
the improvement in local currency terms was the result of improved profitability or reduced losses in several countries  primarily switzerland  the united kingdom and spain 
italian operations continued to maintain a small positive contribution to operating income 
in local currency terms  the cumulative operating loss of spain for the year was approximately of that of the prior year due to substantial operating profits being made in the second half of this fiscal year  confirming a positive trend of returning to profitability 
the variance in operating results of the clinical trials division an operating loss of million as compared to million reflects fixed expenses which are not matched with income to be recorded in the future from a backlog of contracts  due to lead time of up to six months from the signing of a contract to the actual start of a study 
interest expense  net  was practically stable in dollar terms during the year ended may   as compared to the prior year  primarily due to higher average borrowing levels by the company resulting from the company s acquisition of the minority interest in ugl  which was repaid in full january  by the issuance of uniholding share capital  partly offset by a decrease in interest rates 
the ulsa initial public offering had little effect on interest ii expense for the year ended may   as proceeds were received on april  other income before taxes of million was recorded during the year  resulting primarily from a capital gain by ugl on its ulsa investment in connection with ulsa s initial public offering  and from foreign currency transactions  changes in foreign currency positions  as compared to income of million in the prior year 
provision for income taxes for the year ended may   is a tax benefit of million 
million of such benefit is attributable to losses of the clinical trials division which gave rise to a tax benefit  which management believes it is more likely than not that the company will recover through future income of such division in view of the already existing backlog of contracts 
the other million relate to taxation of the diagnostic laboratory division as offset by tax benefits of million due to the losses incurred by the write down due to impairment of goodwill and the value of the uk property 
minority interests in income decreased by million as compared to the prior year  resulting from a the decrease in the minority interests in income due to the acquisition of the minority interest in ugl as of june   offset by the reduction in the holding in ulsa as a result of its initial public offering  and to the variance in operating income of the respective subsidiaries  and b the increase in losses of the clinical trials division attributable to minority shareholders

cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the preceding business and management s discussion and analysis contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which represent the company s expectations or beliefs concerning the company s operations  economic performance and financial condition  including  in particular  forward looking statements regarding the company s expectation of future performance following implementation of its new business strategy 
such statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties 
accordingly  the company hereby identifies the following important factors that could cause the company s actual financial results to differ materially from those projected  forecast  estimated  or budgeted by the company in such forward looking statements 
a heightened competition  including the intensification of price competition 
b impact of changes in tests and payor mix 
c adverse actions by governmental or other third party payors  including unilateral reduction of fee schedules payable to the company

e adverse results in significant litigation matters  if any 
ii f denial of certification or licensure of any of the company s clinical laboratories by governmental agencies 
g adverse publicity and news coverage about the company or the clinical laboratory industry 
h inability to carry out marketing and sales plans 
i inability to successfully integrate the operations of or fully realize costs savings expected from the consolidation of certain operations and the elimination of duplicative expenses or risk that declining revenues or increases in other expenses will offset such savings 
j ability of the company to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 
k changes in interest rates causing an increase in the company s effective borrowing rate  and changes in exchange rates causing variances in consolidated income and expenses reported in dollars 
l the effect of the company s effort to improve account profitability by selectively repricing or discontinuing business which perform below company expectations

other information the company operates in europe in the currencies of the countries in which it is located 
for reporting purposes the financial statements are translated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which require  generally  that assets  liabilities and equity are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses at the weighted average rates during each year 
accordingly assets  liabilities and shareholders equity will be affected by changes in such exchange rates 
the company s operating results will continue to be affected by the volume  mix and timing of test orders received during a period and by conditions in the industry including pricing regulations and in the economies in which the company operates  such as recessionary periods  political instability  and fluctuations in interest or currency exchange rates 
the company further experiences both increases and decreases in its volume of testing due to seasonality shifts 
all laboratories experience a slow down during the holiday seasons  primarily in summer 
this may lead to quarterly information which is not indicative of the trend of the company s business 
inflation was not a material factor in either revenue or operating expenses during the years presented  and is not expected to be in the current year
