item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
within the past several years  the cable television industry has seen much change 
the company believes that the nature of the cable television business is evolving from a traditional coaxial network delivering only video entertainment to a more sophisticated  digital platform environment where cable systems may be capable of delivering traditional programming as well as other services  including data  telephone and expanded educational and entertainment services on an interactive basis 
as this convergence of various technologies progresses  cable television companies will reevaluate their system architecture and upgrade their cable plants in order to take advantage of new opportunities 
as described above  in response to these changes the company has decided to cluster its systems on the basis of operating characteristics and or geographic areas to achieve economies of scale and reasonable returns on the investments made 
the company is also being affected by the entry into the marketplace of local telephone companies that  as a result of the passage of recent legislation  now have the ability to provide telephone and video services in direct competition with the company 
see item  regulation and legislation 
this direct competition with local telephone companies is an additional consideration in the ongoing evaluation by the company of its position in this changing marketplace 
see item  competition 
the company intends  where possible  to pursue these new technological opportunities as they evolve 
the ability of the company to do so  however  will be dependent in large part on the availability of debt and equity financing 
the company is involved in analyzing and testing new technologies used in the telecommunications area  including combined telephone and video services to multiple dwelling units 
the company is utilizing the experience of bci to provide expertise in the telecommunications area 
bci  through its parent company and its affiliates  is engaged in many areas of the telecommunications business 
bce inc  the parent of bci  through its wholly owned subsidiary  bell canada  is the largest telecommunications company in canada 
bell northern research  an affiliate of bci  is canada s largest research and development organization and is engaged in developing and analyzing new technologies used in the telecommunications area 
northern telecom  a subsidiary of bce inc  is a leading global manufacturer of telecommunications equipment 
as cable television systems in the united states evolve and change into more sophisticated digital networks providing traditional television entertainment  but also telephone and data services  and as competition between cable television operators  telephone companies and others develops  the relationship between bci and the company may provide the company with access to expertise and experience that it would not otherwise have available 
with respect to the systems owned by the company and its subsidiaries  the company earns revenues through monthly service rates and related charges to cable television subscribers 
the company s subscribers have the option to choose a limited basic service consisting generally of broadcast stations and a few cable networks basic service or a package of services consisting of basic service and tier services basic plus service 
the basic plus service generally consists of most of the cable networks  including espn  usa network  cnn  discovery  lifetime and others 
see item  the cable television industry  programming 
monthly service rates include fees for basic service  basic plus service and premium services 
at december  monthly basic service rates ranged from to for residential subscribers  monthly basic plus service rates ranged from to for residential subscribers  and monthly premium services ranged from to per premium service 
in addition  the company earns revenues from pay per view programs and advertising fees 
pay per view programs  which usually are either unique sporting events or recently released movies  are available on many of the company s cable television systems 
subscribers are permitted to choose individual movies for a set fee ranging from to per movie and individual special events for a set fee ranging from to per event 
related charges may include a nonrecurring installation fee that ranges from to  however  from time to time the company has followed the common industry practice of reducing the installation fee during promotional periods 
commercial subscribers such as hotels  motels and hospitals are charged a nonrecurring connection fee that usually covers the cost of installation 
except under the terms of certain contracts with commercial subscribers and residential apartment and condominium complexes  subscribers are free to discontinue the service at any time without penalty  and most terminations occur because a subscriber moves to another home or to another city 
for the year ended december  of the total subscriber fees received by company owned systems  basic and basic plus service fees accounted for approximately of total revenues  premium service fees accounted for approximately of total revenues  pay per view fees were approximately of total revenues  advertising fees were approximately of total revenues and the remaining of total revenues came from equipment rentals  installation fees and program guide charges 
the company is dependent upon timely receipt of service fees to provide for maintenance and replacement of plant and equipment  current operating expenses and other costs 
as the general partner of its managed partnerships  the company earns management fees which are generally of the gross revenues of the partnership  not including revenues from the sale of cable television systems or franchises 
the company also receives reimbursement from the partnerships for certain allocated overhead and administrative expenses incurred by the company in its management activities 
from time to time  and although not obligated to do so  the company has made advances to certain of its managed limited partnerships and has deferred collection of management fees and expense reimbursements owed by certain of its managed limited partnerships to allow for expansion of a cable television system or other cash needs of such a partnership 
with respect to the managed partnerships formed by the company  the company as general partner is entitled to partnership distributions from the sale or refinancing of partnership cable systems equal to from to of the net remaining assets of a partnership after the payment of partnership debts and after limited partners have received an amount equal to their original investment plus  in many cases  a preferential return on their investment 
pursuant to the terms of the various limited partnership agreements  the company has full operational control of the management and day to day business of the partnerships 
the company s business consists of providing cable television services to a large number of customers  the loss of any one or more of which would have no material effect on the company s business 
each of the cable television systems owned or operated by the company has had some subscribers who later terminated the service 
terminations occur primarily because people move to another home or to another city 
in other cases  people terminate on a seasonal basis or because they no longer can afford or are dissatisfied with the service 
the amount of past due accounts in systems owned or operated by the company is not significant 
the company s policy with regard to these accounts is basically one of disconnecting service before a past due account becomes material 
the company does not depend to any material extent on the availability of raw materials  it carries no significant amounts of inventory and it has no material backlog of customer orders 
the company has engaged in research and development activities relating to the provision of new services 
compliance with federal  state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has had no material effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of the company 
the company s other businesses and investments the jones group  ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  is a cable television brokerage firm that may earn fees from the company s managed partnerships when such partnerships sell cable systems 
jones futurex  inc  also a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  manufactures and markets data encryption products and provides contract manufacturing services 
the company has an interest in the cable telephony business in the united kingdom through its approximate equity ownership of bell cablemedia plc  one of the united kingdom s largest cable communications operators

cable television franchises the cable television systems owned or managed by the company are constructed and operated under fixed term franchises or other types of operating authorities referred to collectively herein as franchises that are generally non exclusive and are granted by state and or local governmental authorities 
these franchises typically contain many conditions  such as time limitations on commencement and completion of construction  conditions of service  including the number of channels  types of programming and the provision of free service to schools and certain other public institutions  and the maintenance of insurance and indemnity bonds 
the provisions of local franchises are subject to federal regulation 
the company holds approximately franchises 
these franchises provide for the payment of fees to the issuing authorities and range from to of gross revenues 
the cable act prohibits franchising authorities from imposing annual franchise fees in excess of of gross revenues and also permits the cable television system operator to seek renegotiation and modification of franchise requirements if warranted by changed circumstances 
the company has never had a franchise revoked 
the company s franchises initially had terms of approximately to years 
the duration of the company s outstanding franchises presently varies from a period of months to an indefinite period of time 
the company is currently negotiating the renewal of sixteen franchises that are either operating under extensions or will expire prior to december  during the next three to five years  the renewal process must commence for a significant number of the franchises for cable television systems owned or managed by the company and its affiliates 
the company recently has experienced lengthy negotiations with some franchising authorities for the granting of franchise renewals 
some of the issues involved in recent renewal negotiations include rate regulation  customer service standards  cable plant upgrade or replacement and shorter terms of franchise agreements 
competition cable television systems currently experience competition from several sources 
broadcast television 
cable television systems have traditionally competed with broadcast television  which consists of television signals that the viewer is able to receive directly on his television without charge using an off air antenna 
the extent of such competition is dependent in part upon the quality and quantity of signals available by such antenna reception as compared to the services provided by the local cable system 
accordingly  it has generally been less difficult for cable operators to obtain higher penetration rates in rural areas where signals available off air are limited  than in metropolitan areas where numerous  high quality off air signals are often available without the aid of cable television systems 
traditional overbuild 
cable television franchises are not exclusive  so that more than one cable television system may be built in the same area known as an overbuild  with potential loss of revenues to the operator of the original cable television system 
the company has experienced overbuilds in connection with certain systems that it has owned or managed for limited partnerships  and currently there are overbuilds in both owned and managed systems 
constructing and developing a cable television system is a capital intensive process  and it is often difficult for a new cable system operator to create a marketing edge over the existing system 
generally  an overbuilder would be required to obtain franchises from the local governmental authorities  although in some instances  the overbuilder could be the local government itself 
in any case  an overbuilder would be required to obtain programming contracts from entertainment programmers and  in most cases  would have to build a complete cable system  including headends  trunk lines and drops to individual subscribers homes  throughout the franchise areas 
the panama city beach system has lost basic subscribers and commercial units to an overbuilder 
this overbuild continues to provide significant competition and has had an adverse effect on the system s operations 
the company s anne arundel system also faces significant competition from an overbuilder 
dbs 
high powered direct to home satellites have made possible the wide scale delivery of programming to individuals throughout the united states using small roof top or wall mounted antennas 
several companies began offering direct broadcast satellite dbs service over the last few years and additional entrants are expected 
companies offering dbs service use video compression technology to increase channel capacity of their systems to or more channels and to provide packages of movies  satellite network and other program services which are competitive to those of cable television systems 
dbs cannot currently offer its subscribers local programming  although at least one future dbs entrant is attempting to offer customers regional delivery of local broadcast signals 
in addition to emerging high powered dbs competition  cable television systems face competition from a major medium powered satellite distribution provider and several low powered providers  whose service requires use of much larger home satellite dishes 
not all subscribers terminate cable television service upon acquiring a dbs system 
the company has observed that there are dbs subscribers that also elect to subscribe to cable television service in order to obtain the greatest variety of programming on multiple television sets  including local programming not available through dbs service 
the ability of dbs service providers to compete successfully with the cable television industry will depend on  among other factors  the availability of equipment at reasonable prices 
telephone 
federal cross ownership restrictions historically limited entry by local telephone companies into the cable television business 
the telecom act eliminated this cross ownership restriction  making it possible for companies with considerable resources to overbuild existing cable operators and enter the business 
several telephone companies have begun seeking cable television franchises from local governmental authorities and constructing cable television systems 
ameritech  one of the seven regional bell operating companies bocs  which provides telephone service in a multi state region including illinois  has been the most active boc in seeking local cable franchises within its service area 
it has already begun cable service in naperville  illinois and has also obtained franchises for glen ellyn and vernon hills  illinois  all of which are currently served by cable systems owned by two company managed partnerships 
the company cannot predict at this time the extent of telephone company competition that will emerge to company owned or managed cable television systems 
the entry of telephone companies as direct competitors  however  is likely to continue over the next several years and could adversely affect the profitability and market value of the company s owned and managed systems 
the entry of electric utility companies into the cable television business  as now authorized by the telecom act  could have a similar adverse effect 
private cable 
additional competition is provided by private cable television systems  known as satellite master antenna television smatv  serving multi unit dwellings such as condominiums  apartment complexes  and private residential communities 
these private cable systems may enter into exclusive agreements with apartment owners and homeowners associations  which may preclude operators of franchised systems from serving residents of such private complexes 
private cable systems that do not cross public rights of way are free from the federal  state and local regulatory requirements imposed on franchised cable television operators 
in some cases  the company has been unable to provide cable television service to buildings in which private operators have secured exclusive contracts to provide video and telephony services 
the company is interested in providing these same services  but expects that the market to install and provide these services in multi unit buildings will continue to be highly competitive 
in late  the company launched a competitive telephone service in selected apartments and condominium units in its alexandria  virginia system  and anticipates providing such service  commencing in the first half of  in maryland as well 
the company faces considerable competition in providing telephony service from incumbent local exchange carriers and a host of alternative carriers 
mmds 
cable television systems also compete with wireless program distribution services such as multichannel  multipoint distribution service mmds systems  commonly called wireless cable  which are licensed to serve specific areas 
mmds uses low power microwave frequencies to transmit television programming over the air to paying subscribers 
the mmds industry is less capital intensive than the cable television industry  and it is therefore more practical to construct mmds systems in areas of lower subscriber penetration 
wireless cable systems are now in direct competition with cable television systems in several areas of the country  including the company s system in pima county  arizona 
telephone companies have recently acquired or invested in wireless companies  and may use mmds systems to provide services within their service areas in lieu of wired delivery systems 
enthusiasm for mmds has waned in recent months  however  as bell atlantic and nynex have suspended their investment in two major mmds companies 
to date  the company has not lost a significant number of subscribers  nor a significant amount of revenue  to mmds operators competing with the company s cable television systems 
a series of actions taken by the fcc  however  including reallocating certain frequencies to the wireless services  are intended to facilitate the development of wireless cable television systems as an alternative means of distributing video programming 
the fcc recently held auctions for spectrum that will be used by wireless operators to provide additional channels of programming over larger distances 
in addition  an emerging technology  local multipoint distribution services lmds  could also pose a significant threat to the cable television industry  if and when it becomes established 
lmds  sometimes referred to as cellular television  could have the capability of delivering more than channels of video programming to a subscriber s home 
the potential impact  however  of lmds is difficult to assess due to the newness of the technology and the absence of any current fully operational lmds systems 
cable television systems are also in competition  in various degrees with other communications and entertainment media  including motion pictures and home video cassette recorders 
regulation and legislation the operation of cable television systems is extensively regulated by the fcc  some state governments and most local governments 
the new telecommunications act of telecom act alters the regulatory structure governing the nation s telecommunications providers 
it removes barriers to competition in both the cable television market and the local telephone market 
among other things  it also reduces the scope of cable rate regulation 
the telecom act requires the fcc to undertake a host of implementing rulemakings  the final outcome of which cannot yet be determined 
moreover  congress and the fcc have frequently revisited the subject of cable regulation 
future legislative and regulatory changes could adversely affect the company s operations 
this section briefly summarizes key laws and regulations affecting the operation of the company s cable systems and does not purport to describe all present  proposed  or possible laws and regulations affecting the company 
cable rate regulation 
the cable act imposed an extensive rate regulation regime on the cable television industry 
under that regime  all cable systems are subject to rate regulation  unless they face effective competition in their local franchise area 
federal law now defines effective competition on a community specific basis as requiring either low penetration less than by the incumbent cable operator  appreciable penetration more than by competing multichannel video providers mvps  or the presence of a competing mvp affiliated with a local telephone company 
the fcc has officially recognized that the anne arundel system and the panama city beach system face effective competition  and a similar petition is now pending at the fcc concerning the pima county  az system 
although the fcc rules control  local government units commonly referred to as local franchising authorities or lfas are primarily responsible for administering the regulation of the lowest level of cable the basic service tier bst  which typically contains local broadcast stations and public  educational  and government peg access channels 
before an lfa begins bst rate regulation  it must certify to the fcc that it will follow applicable federal rules  and many lfas have voluntarily declined to exercise this authority 
lfas also have primary responsibility for regulating cable equipment rates 
under federal law  charges for various types of cable equipment must be unbundled from each other and from monthly charges for programming services 
the telecom act allows operators to aggregate costs for broad categories of equipment across geographic and functional lines 
this change should facilitate the introduction of new technology 
the fcc itself directly administers rate regulation of any cable programming service tiers cpst  which typically contain satellite delivered programming 
under the telecom act  the fcc can regulate cpst rates only if an lfa first receives at least two rate complaints from local subscribers and then files a formal complaint with the fcc 
when new cpst rate complaints are filed  the fcc now considers only whether the incremental increase is justified and will not reduce the previously established cpst rate 
under the fcc s rate regulations  most cable systems were required to reduce their bst and cpst rates in and  and have since had their rate increases governed by a complicated price cap scheme that allows for the recovery of inflation and certain increased costs  as well as providing some incentive for expanding channel carriage 
the fcc has modified its rate adjustment regulations to allow for annual rate increases and to minimize previous problems associated with regulatory lag 
operators also have the opportunity of bypassing this benchmark regulatory scheme in favor of traditional cost of service regulation in cases where the latter methodology appears favorable 
premium cable services offered on a per channel or per program basis remain unregulated  as do affirmatively marketed packages consisting entirely of new programming product 
federal law requires that the bst be offered to all cable subscribers  but limits the ability of operators to require purchase of any cpst before purchasing premium services offered on a per channel or per program basis 
the telecom act sunsets fcc regulation of cpst rates for all systems regardless of size on march  it also relaxes existing uniform rate requirements by specifying that uniform rate requirements do not apply where the operator faces effective competition  and by exempting bulk discounts to multiple dwelling units  although complaints about predatory pricing still may be made to the fcc 
cable entry into telecommunications 
the telecom act provides that no state or local laws or regulations may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting any entity from providing any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service 
states are authorized  however  to impose competitively neutral requirements regarding universal service  public safety and welfare  service quality  and consumer protection 
state and local governments also retain their authority to manage the public rights of way and may require reasonable  competitively neutral compensation for management of the public rights of way when cable operators provide telecommunications service 
the favorable pole attachment rates afforded cable operators under federal law can be gradually increased by utility companies owning the poles beginning in if the operator provides telecommunications service  as well as cable service  over its plant 
cable entry into telecommunications will be affected by the regulatory landscape now being fashioned by the fcc and state regulators 
one critical component of the telecom act to facilitate the entry of new telecommunications providers including cable operators is the interconnection obligation imposed on all telecommunications carriers 
review of the fcc s initial interconnection order is now pending before the eighth circuit court of appeals 
the company has already secured authorization to provide local exchange service in maryland and portions of virginia and has begun offering some telecommunications services to customers in both jurisdictions 
telephone company entry into cable television 
the telecom act allows telephone companies to compete directly with cable operators by repealing the historic telephone company cable cross ownership ban 
local exchange carriers lecs  including the bocs  can now compete with cable operators both inside and outside their telephone service areas 
because of their resources  lecs could be formidable competitors to traditional cable operators  and certain lecs have begun offering cable service 
as described above  the company is now witnessing the beginning of lec competition in a few of its cable communities 
under the telecom act  a lec providing video programming to subscribers will be regulated as a traditional cable operator subject to local franchising and federal regulatory requirements  unless the lec elects to provide its programming via an open video system ovs 
to qualify for ovs status  the lec must reserve two thirds of the system s activated channels for unaffiliated entities 
although lecs and cable operators can now expand their offerings across traditional service boundaries  the general prohibition remains on lec buyouts ie  any ownership interest exceeding percent of co located cable systems  cable operator buyouts of co located lec systems  and joint ventures between cable operators and lecs in the same market 
the telecom act provides a few limited exceptions to this buyout prohibition  including a carefully circumscribed rural exemption 
the telecom act also provides the fcc with the limited authority to grant waivers of the buyout prohibition subject to lfa approval 
electric utility entry into telecommunications cable television 
the telecom act provides that registered utility holding companies and subsidiaries may provide telecommunications services including cable television notwithstanding the public utilities holding company act 
electric utilities must establish separate subsidiaries  known as exempt telecommunications companies and must apply to the fcc for operating authority 
again  because of their resources  electric utilities could be formidable competitors to traditional cable systems 
additional ownership restrictions 
the telecom act eliminates statutory restrictions on broadcast cable cross ownership including broadcast network cable restrictions  but leaves in place existing fcc regulations prohibiting local cross ownership between co located television stations and cable systems 
the telecom act also eliminates the three year holding period required under the cable act s anti trafficking provision 
the telecom act leaves in place existing restrictions on cable cross ownership with smatv and mmds facilities  but lifts those restrictions where the cable operator is subject to effective competition 
in january  however  the fcc adopted regulations which permit cable operators to own and operate smatv systems within their franchise area  provided that such operation is consistent with local cable franchise requirements 
pursuant to the cable act  the fcc adopted rules precluding a cable system from devoting more than of its activated channel capacity to the carriage of affiliated national program services 
a companion rule establishing a nationwide ownership cap on any cable operator equal to of all domestic cable subscribers has been stayed pending further judicial review 
there are no federal restrictions on non us entities having an ownership interest in cable television systems or the fcc licenses commonly employed by such systems 
section b of the communications act does  however  prohibit foreign ownership of fcc broadcast and telephone licenses  unless the fcc concludes that such foreign ownership is consistent with the public interest 
bci s investment in the company could  therefore  adversely affect any plan to acquire fcc broadcast or common carrier licenses 
must carry retransmission consent 
the cable act contains broadcast signal carriage requirements that allow local commercial television broadcast stations to elect once every three years between requiring a cable system to carry the station must carry or negotiating for payments for granting permission to the cable operator to carry the station retransmission consent 
less popular stations typically elect must carry  and more popular stations typically elect retransmission consent 
must carry requests can dilute the appeal of a cable system s programming offerings  and retransmission consent demands may require substantial payments or other concessions 
either option has a potentially adverse affect on the company s business 
additionally  cable systems are required to obtain retransmission consent for all distant commercial television stations except for satellite delivered independent superstations such as wtbs 
the constitutionality of the must carry requirements has been challenged and is awaiting a decision from the us supreme court 
access channels 
lfas can include franchise provisions requiring cable operators to set aside certain channels for public  educational and governmental access programming 
federal law also requires cable systems to designate a portion of their channel capacity up to in some cases for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third parties 
the fcc has adopted rules regulating the terms  conditions and maximum rates a cable operator may charge for use of the designated channel capacity  but use of commercial leased access channels has been relatively limited 
the fcc released revised rules in february which mandate a modest rate reduction and could make commercial leased access a more attractive option to third party programmers 
access to programming 
to spur the development of independent cable programmers and competition to incumbent cable operators  the cable act imposed restrictions on the dealings between cable operators and cable programmers 
of special significance from a competitive business posture  the cable act precludes video programmers affiliated with cable companies from favoring cable operators over competitors and requires such programmers to sell their programming to other multichannel video distributors 
this provision limits the ability of vertically integrated cable programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements to cable companies 
other fcc regulations 
in addition to the fcc regulations noted above  there are other fcc regulations covering such areas as equal employment opportunity  subscriber privacy  programming practices including  among other things  syndicated program exclusivity  network program nonduplication  local sports blackouts  indecent programming  lottery programming  political programming  sponsorship identification  and children s programming advertisements  registration of cable systems and facilities licensing  maintenance of various records and public inspection files  frequency usage  lockbox availability  antenna structure notification  tower marking and lighting  consumer protection and customer service standards  technical standards  and consumer electronics equipment compatibility 
the fcc is expected to impose new emergency alert system requirements on cable operators this year 
the fcc has the authority to enforce its regulations through the imposition of substantial fines  the issuance of cease and desist orders and or the imposition of other administrative sanctions  such as the revocation of fcc licenses needed to operate certain transmission facilities used in connection with cable operations 
two pending fcc proceedings of particular competitive concern involve inside wiring and navigational devices 
the former rulemaking is considering ownership of cable wiring located inside multiple dwelling unit complexes 
if the fcc concludes that such wiring belongs to  or can be unilaterally acquired by the complex owner  it will become easier for complex owners to terminate service from the incumbent cable operator in favor of a new entrant 
the latter rulemaking is considering whether cable customers must be allowed to purchase cable converters from third party vendors 
if the fcc concludes that such distribution is required  and does not make appropriate allowances for signal piracy concerns  it may become more difficult for cable operators to combat theft of service 
copyright 
cable television systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals 
in exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of their revenues to a federal copyright royalty pool that varies depending on the size of the system and the number of distant broadcast television signals carried  cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material on broadcast signals 
the possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative review and could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain desired broadcast programming 
in addition  the cable industry pays music licensing fees to bmi and is negotiating a similar arrangement with ascap 
copyright clearances for nonbroadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations 
state and local regulation 
cable television systems generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity in order to cross public rights of way 
federal law now prohibits franchise authorities from granting exclusive franchises or from unreasonably refusing to award additional franchises 
cable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases include monetary penalties for non compliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions 
the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
each franchise generally contains provisions governing cable operations  service rates  franchise fees  system construction and maintenance obligations  system channel capacity  design and technical performance  customer service standards  and indemnification protections 
a number of states subject cable television systems to the jurisdiction of centralized state governmental agencies  some of which impose regulation of a character similar to that of a public utility 
although lfas have considerable discretion in establishing franchise terms  there are certain federal limitations 
for example  lfas cannot insist on franchise fees exceeding of the system s gross revenues  cannot dictate the particular technology used by the system  and cannot specify video programming other than identifying broad categories of programming 
federal law contains renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal 
even if a franchise is renewed  the franchise authority may seek to impose new and more onerous requirements such as significant upgrades in facilities and services or increased franchise fees as a condition of renewal 
similarly  if a franchise authority s consent is required for the purchase or sale of a cable system or franchise  such authority may attempt to impose more burdensome or onerous franchise requirements in connection with a request for consent 
historically  franchises have been renewed for cable operators that have provided satisfactory services and have complied with the terms of their franchises

on january   the company was served with an amended class action complaint and request for jury trial 
on february   the company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint arguing that the action was improperly brought as a class action 
the company argued that the plaintiff could only bring the action as a derivative claim and that because the elements of a derivative claim had not been properly pleaded  the amended complaint should be dismissed 
after briefing on this motion  the court entered an order on june  granting the company s motion to dismiss  and on july   the court entered a further order allowing plaintiff to file another amended complaint 
on july   plaintiff hirsch filed a second amended complaint

fund d and that he now purports to bring this case as a derivative action on behalf of cable tv fund b  ltd

fund c and fund d 
the suit relates to the purchase by the company from cable tv fund bcd venture the venture a general partnership in which fund d is a general partner of the tampa system and subsequent trade of the tampa system  along with other cable systems  to time warner for certain of time warner s cable systems 
the company was authorized to purchase the tampa system from the venture pursuant to the terms of the limited partnership agreements of fund b  fund c and fund d 
also on july   the same lawyers who represent mr 
hirsch filed a verified complaint on behalf of jonathan fussner and eileen fussner as referenced above 
the fussners also purport to be joint owners of limited partnership interests units in fund d and their verified complaint is identical in all substantive respects to the hirsch second amended complaint 
on december   the court consolidated the hirsch and fussner actions 
the second amended complaint in hirsch and the verified complaint in fussner allege that the company breached its fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs and the other limited partners of fund b  fund c and fund d and the venture in connection with the purchase of the tampa system and the trade of that system to time warner 
the hirsch and fussner complaints also set forth a claim for unjust enrichment and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
among other things  the plaintiffs assert that the company paid an inadequate price for the tampa system  even though the agreed upon price was the average of three separate appraisals  as required by the applicable partnership agreements 
the hirsch and fussner cases are now styled as derivative actions and also seek a trial by jury

on november   plaintiff martin ury filed a complaint against the company in the above referenced action in arapahoe county district court 
plaintiff ury alleges that he is a limited partner in fund d 
he purports to bring this case as a derivative action on behalf of fund b  fund c and fund d 
as in hirsch and fussner  discussed above  this case relates to the company s purchase of the tampa system and the time warner exchange 
the substantive allegations of the ury complaint are substantially similar to the allegations in the hirsch second amended complaint and the fussner verified complaint 
the plaintiff in ury alleges that the company breached its fiduciary duties to the limited partnerships and their limited partners in connection with its purchase of the tampa system from the venture 
specifically  the plaintiff alleges that the company paid an inadequate price for the tampa system  even though the agreed upon price was the average of three separate appraisals  as required by the applicable limited partnership agreements 
the complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount on behalf of the three limited partnerships and an award of attorneys fees 
the complaint does not seek a jury trial or punitive damages 
on february   the company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it fails to state a claim against the company upon which relief can be granted 
the thrust of the company s motion was that the company cannot be liable for breach of fiduciary duty because it acted in accordance with the terms of the limited partnership agreements in its purchase of the tampa system 
the company also argued that plaintiff does not have standing to assert a derivative claim on behalf of fund b or fund c  since he is only a limited partner in fund d 
on july   the court denied the company s motion to dismiss 
the company filed its answer in this case on july   generally denying the substantive allegations in the complaint  asserting a number of affirmative defenses and requesting a trial by jury 
a case management order has been entered by the court  setting the case for a two week jury trial commencing on september  the parties have made certain voluntary disclosures pursuant to rule of the colorado rules of civil procedure  and discovery has begun although no depositions have been taken to date
