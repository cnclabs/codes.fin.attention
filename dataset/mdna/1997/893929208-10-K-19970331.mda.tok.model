item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company including the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
overview transcend is a healthcare services company focused on the emerging field of healthcare information management him services to hospitals and other associated healthcare providers 
the company provides a range of him services  including i contract management outsourcing of the healthcare information or medical records function  as well as the admissions function  ii transcription of physicians dictated medical notes  and iii consulting services relating to medical records and reimbursement coding 
as of december   the company operated on a contract management basis  the medical records and certain other him functions of general acute care hospitals located in states and the district of columbia 
the company also provides through its wholly owned subsidiary  sullivan health management services  inc  case management and disability management services to insurance carriers  third party administrators and self insured employers 
the company intends to expand the range of its contract management services to include management of other functional areas of hospitals  such as management of patient access admissions  utilization review  quality assurance and the business office 
as of december   the company provided full contract management outsourcing services in the admissions departments for three of the hospitals it manages 
the company is actively seeking to provide this expanded range of services to its current and future hospital customers 
the company also provides  through outsourcing as well as other contracts  medical records transcription services through computer and telephone links from centralized facilities to approximately hospital customers 
approximately  hospitals in the united states have more than beds and constitute the company s first tier of market opportunity 
the company had contract management contracts covering the medical records departments of hospitals as of december  and hospitals as of december   ranging in bed size from beds to beds  with the average contract size of approximately million 
the initial contract terms of the company s current contracts range from two to five years and are generally terminable without cause upon expiration of the initial term or for cause at any time during the initial term thereof 
the company s existing contracts currently have remaining terms ranging from approximately one to five years 
due to its limited operating history in medical records management  the company is unable at the present time to assess or predict its contract renewal rate 
the company negotiates its contract management fees on a fixed installment basis which represents  at contract inception  an immediate savings to the contracting hospital as compared to its historical costs 
in the early term of such a contract  the company s expenses in providing the contract services remain relatively high  as a percentage of contract revenues received  as set up and training costs are incurred  new procedures are implemented and departmental reorganizations are initiated 
completion of such steps should result in lower operating expenses  which in turn should increase the profit margin of a constant revenue stream over time 
due to the company s limited operating history in the contract management business  however  there can be no assurances that operating expenses will sufficiently decrease over the life of such contracts to achieve profitability 
the company is experimenting with an alternative volume based pricing structure  based upon a hospital s activity levels such as weighted average number of annual patient discharges  or a per member per month pmpm capitated pricing option similar to current pricing mechanisms used by managed healthcare groups 
as of december   the company had signed one contract based on a volume oriented pricing structure tied to weighted annual patient discharges 
there is an opportunity to realize higher margins on an activity based pricing structure 
the principal advantage of a volume based pricing mechanism is that as a hospital s volume of business increases  the company s revenues will increase at a faster rate than operating expenses 
however  if a customer s business volume decreases  the company s revenues will also decrease at a faster rate than its operating expenses 
the company is also considering pricing its contract management contracts  where possible  to provide for more contingency sharing of either i the one time cash flow savings that the company generates for its contract management customers through a reduction in gross days receivables outstanding by processing bills being delayed in the medical records department and or ii increased revenues realized by hospital customers as a result of the company s favorable impact through enhanced coder and physician training on the hospital s case mix index a measurement of the hospital s severity acuity level for drg reimbursements under medicare 
of its contracts as of december   only one contract was priced under a contingency sharing arrangement 
the company is typically paid for its transcription services on a production basis at rates determined on a per line transcribed basis 
where transcription services are included as part of the services provided in the company s outsourcing contracts  however  the services are provided by the company as part of a set contract fee 
the company is paid for its consulting and coding services on a negotiated fee for services basis 
in addition  the company is paid for its healthcare case management services primarily on an hourly basis 
results of operations the company s losses from operations in  and were   and  respectively 
management believes that the company s operating losses are primarily attributable to the significant expenses incurred by the company to build a larger sales and management organization to support an increased number of outsourcing contracts and the expansion of the company s services to healthcare institutions 
in fiscal  and  the company s marketing and sales expenses were   and  respectively 
in addition  the company s general and administrative expenses for fiscal  and were   and  respectively 
the buildup of the company s management infrastructure had been put in place to match the anticipated rapid growth in its outsourcing business 
the company s major reorganization  initiated in july august of  resulted in significant cost reductions and helped the company achieve a near break even result from continuing operations operating loss prior to interest and amortization expenses of approximately  in the fourth quarter of the company will be required to increase its revenues from contract management and other services and effectively manage its costs to achieve profitability 
in addition  the company s pricing mechanism on most of its outsourcing contracts requires the company to increase operating efficiencies over the life of the contract in order to increase profit margins 
the company will also be required to procure a critical mass of such contracts and be able to renew such contracts on favorable terms 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attain the required operating efficiencies or increase the number of outsourcing contracts to the level needed to become profitable 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues for the company increased from  in to  in  an increase of 
contract management revenues were the largest single service class revenue source for the company representing of total revenues in and in contract management revenues increased from  in to  in  an increase of 
medical transcription revenues were the second largest source of revenues for the company for and  representing of total revenues in and in the medical transcription revenues grew from  in to  in  an increase of 
consulting and coding revenues represented of the company s total revenues for and of the company s total revenues for consulting and coding revenues increased from  in to  in case management revenues represented of the company s total revenues in as compared to in case management revenues decreased from  in to  in  a decrease of due to a consolidation of certain sales territories and the loss of several key accounts 
the increase in total revenues for is primarily attributable to i contract management outsourcing revenues of approximately  related to contract management contracts signed in the second half of and for the calendar year and ii increased medical transcription revenues  primarily resulting from strong internal growth in existing locations and the acquisition of two transcription businesses greiner medical transcription  gmt  and express medical transcription  emt in june of gmt contributed  and emt contributed  in revenues  together representing  or of the total increase of  in medical transcription revenues 
these increases were partially offset by the decrease in case management revenues in the company s wholly owned subsidiary  sullivan health management  which has sustained the loss of several key accounts over the fiscal year 
in august   the company hired an experienced sales and operations manager to serve as president of sullivan and lead a re building effort now underway to increase sales and improve the operations of sullivan 
sullivan experienced a net loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december  gross profit increased to  for from  in the prior year 
gross profit as a percentage of total company revenues decreased to for from in the prior year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the medical transcription division  which experienced a decrease in gross margins from in to for the margin decrease in transcription was a result of increased operating costs in several of the company s transcription sites  including the costs associated with opening a new branch location  the start up costs incurred with implementing several new outsourcing contracts in transcription and the costs associated with the company s recently acquired transcription companies in salt lake city emt and los angeles gmt 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased in the contract management division from in to in as a result of i decreased operating expenses incurred in several contract management accounts during the fourth quarter of  ii more effective implementation of new sites and iii favorable re pricing of two of its twenty contracts 
the company s overall gross margin was further eroded in the to comparison by the decrease in case management s gross profit margin from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this decline in case management gross margin is the result of a higher case management operating cost structure in place while revenues declined 
sullivan s cost structure has been restructured to more closely match its current revenue stream 
marketing and sales expenses increased to  in from  in the prior year and decreased as a percentage of revenues to for from for the decrease in sales and marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenues is attributable to the company s investment in a national sales force and marketing program in and early which has led to a significant increase in sales in without a material increase in marketing and sales expenditures in the fiscal year 
the company believes that as revenues increase  marketing and sales expense  as a percentage of revenues  should decline 
general and administrative expenses of  for the fiscal year increased approximately over the  expended in the same prior year period  however  this represents a decrease as measured as a percentage of revenues in comparing and the decline in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from in to in is a result of the company s leveraging its relatively fixed sales and administrative cost structure over a higher revenue base 
the company expensed approximately million in one time charges incurred in connection with the company s internal reorganization and restructuring efforts 
the company believes that the reorganization of its sales  operating and administrative functions undertaken in the third quarter of should result in a significant reduction of selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses in specifically  s  g a expenses inclusive of its sullivan subsidiary s s  g a costs included one time costs in of approximately  of which approximately were severance costs for employees whose job positions were eliminated 
reduced employee expenses were realized in the fourth quarter of and will continue to be realized in as a result of these actions 
the remaining non recurring costs included i moving expenses incurred in sullivan s corporate office relocation  ii costs incurred in connection with the emt and gmt acquisitions  iii consulting fees incurred in connection with the company s information service center concept  and iv costs  including legal  incurred in connection with the settlement of a lease buy out transaction 
the impact of the reorganization has been realized in the fourth quarter of and the company anticipates that it will continue thereafter in on a comparative basis as the cost reductions inherent in this reorganization were more or less permanent 
the company also recognized in the fiscal year ended december   through its reorganization  approximately  of one time non recurring costs in its direct operating costs that negatively impacted gross margins for the contract management  transcription and sullivan operations 
these costs primarily related to the loss and transition from one contract management account and the setting up of a new large outsourced transcription customer 
these costs  on a comparative quarter to quarter basis  will not be repeated going forward 
in a quarter to quarter comparison  the company s general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage or revenue from in the third quarter ended september  to of revenue in the fourth quarter ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of the company s reorganization and restructuring undertaken in july and august   and the fact that there were significant one time charges incurred in connection with the reorganization efforts that were realized in the third quarter ended september  amortization expenses decreased to  in from  in reflecting the impact of the acquisition of datalogix  inc being fully amortized 
other expenses increased to  for as compared to  for  primarily due to the impact of interest expense incurred in connection with i the august  private placement of subordinated convertible debentures and ii the company s borrowings against its working capital line of credit totaling  as of december  also  the company expensed  in the third quarter of to cover all of its legal  accounting and printing costs incurred in connection with its filing of a registration statement in may to raise additional capital through a public offering of its common stock 
due to adverse market conditions  the company withdrew its offering in july  the company s loss before discontinued operations increased to  for from  in the prior year  inclusive of several one time  non recurring charges  namely i the million write down of the amhealth receivable  ii approximately  incurred in connection with the company s attempt to raise additional capital through a public offering of its common stock in may of  and iii approximately million incurred in connection with the company s internal reorganization and restructuring 
the company s reorganization has resulted in a more streamlined management  sales and implementation effort and has lowered the company s overall selling  general  administrative and operating costs 
this was first evident in the three month period ending december  where results from continuing operations  before interest and amortization  were at a near break even level approximately  loss and this represented the company s single best operating quarter since september  the loss from discontinued operations increased to  for from  in as a result of the charge for legal fees incurred in connection with the company s civil lawsuit against certain insurance companies in the state of california 
with respect to any future expenses related to the lawsuit  commencing in december and for the remainder of the case  the company is only responsible for out of pocket expenses and the payment to its legal counsel of a percentage of any recovery awarded in the lawsuit 
all future out of pocket legal expenses  in excess of the capped legal fees  will continue to be expensed on a current basis

medical transcription revenues represented of the company s total revenues in as compared to of total revenues in sullivan s revenues are not included as they were prior to the merger  therefore   of the  total revenue increase in the company s revenues between and is due to the inclusion of sullivan in gross profit increased to  in from  in gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to the addition of sullivan s case management revenues reflecting an overall gross margin 
gross margins in contract management outsourcing increased to from in average transcription margins increased from to 
marketing and sales expenses increased to  in from  in and increased as a percentage of revenues to from in the increase is attributable to expenses of approximately  associated with the efforts to heighten market awareness of the company and contract outsourcing  the expansion of the company s sales force by the addition of one person  an increase in commission compensation of approximately  relating to the six new contract management contracts signed in the third quarter and the additional sales costs of approximately  related to the case management division 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in and increased as a percentage of revenues to from 
the increase reflects additional expense of approximately  for expanded management and support staff incurred to position the company for future growth  as well as the additional overhead of approximately  attributable to the merger 
amortization expenses increased to  in from  in reflecting the additional amortization expense of  related to the full impact of the intangible assets associated with the company s acquisition of three medical transcription businesses and the additional amortization expense of  related to the merger 
other expense decreased to  in from  in  primarily as the result of the company s recognition of higher interest income as applied against interest expense 
the company s loss before discontinued operations increased to  in from  in  however  beginning in the second quarter of  the company realized an improving trend with regard to minimizing its loss from operations 
the company s loss from continuing operations was  in the second quarter ending june  the loss from continuing operations for the third quarter ended september  was  while the fourth quarter ended december  loss from operations decreased to  the company s loss from discontinued operations of  in represents legal expenses incurred in connection with the lawsuit 
see item legal proceedings 
total current assets increased to  in from  in and trade accounts receivable increased to  in from  in this increase in current assets and accounts receivable is attributable to a number of factors including i the merger  which accounted for  and  of the increase in total current assets and trade accounts receivable  respectively  ii the acquisition of sullivan  which accounted for  and  of the increase in total current assets and trade accounts receivable  respectively  iii the addition of new outsourcing contracts  which accounted for  and  of the increase in total current assets and trade accounts receivable  respectively  and iv the growth of the company s transcription business following the acquisitions of mta and ids  which accounted for  of the increase in total current assets and trade accounts receivable 
in addition  in connection with the growth of the company s transcription and its consulting and coding businesses  accounts receivable increased for fiscal because it took transcription and consulting and coding accounts receivable approximately days to turn in as compared to approximately days in liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flows from continuing operations required the use of cash of  and  and  in  and  respectively 
cash has been used to continue funding the company s operating losses and  in  to finance the growth of certain of the company s acquisitions working capital needs 
see consolidated statements of cash flows 
discontinued operations used cash of  in this is a net cash total that includes cash contributed from discontinued operations through the collection of accounts receivable of  and cash expenditures of  for collection costs and legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the company s civil lawsuit filed against certain insurance carriers in the superior court in california 
see item legal proceedings 
the accounts receivable from the discontinued operations represent reimbursements that are owed the company by certain insurance companies for applicant medical legal evaluation services provided by fwhc medical group  inc and veritas medical group  inc  two managed medical groups associated with the company s former subsidiaries  first western and veritas 
the gross receivables  however  are subject to liens before the wcab  an administrative body charged with determining an insurance company s liability for the payment of medical legal evaluation services 
the company expects to collect the accounts receivable from discontinued operations over the next several years under the provisions of the sale and service agreement that the company has entered into with a third party for servicing and managing the remaining accounts receivable balance 
in estimating net accounts receivable  the company believes that it has made adequate provisions as to the estimated amount of gross receivables that the company can expect to collect upon resolution by the california wcab of the collectibility of the disputed portion of the receivables 
the company will continue to re evaluate the net realizability of the net assets related to discontinued operations on an ongoing basis 
any such re evaluation could result in an adjustment that may potentially be material to the carrying value of the assets 
see item business discontinued operations 
the company s working capital position decreased during the twelve months ended december   from  at december  to a negative  at december  this decline in the company s working capital position is primarily the result of the company having to increase its short term debt ie  working capital credit facility provided by silicon valley bank by million to help finance the company s large losses from continuing and discontinued ie  lawsuit fees and expenses operations 
although the company has a negative cash flow  the company s accounts receivables turn faster than related payables  allowing the company to operate and grow its business 
under the terms of its contract management fixed fee pricing schedules  the company receives the annual fee in monthly payments in advance due on the first day of the month  prior to actually incurring any of the month s fixed and or variable operating expenses 
this results in accounts receivables for contract management turning in approximately seven days 
the company also receives an up front implementation fee prior to incurring any costs associated with the actual start up of a contract management site 
the company s cash flows from investing activities used cash of  and  in and  respectively  and provided cash of  in the company s principal uses of cash for investing purposes are for capital expenditures and acquisitions 
in  the company incurred  in capital expenditures  primarily in its medical transcription division for digital dictation equipment and related technology investments

in  in connection with the company s acquisition of tricare  it acquired approximately million of cash 
in the company expended  in cash to acquire the medical transcription businesses of ids and mta 
in connection with these acquisitions  on august   the company raised million in cash through the private placement of subordinated convertible debentures 
the debentures are unsecured and subordinated to all other debt of the company 
the interest rate on the debentures is  payable semi annually  and the principal amount is due in full on august  the debentures are convertible into common stock by the holder at any time prior to august  at a rate of shares of common stock for each  in principal amount and are convertible by the company at any time when the common stock trades at per share for consecutive trading days

cash flows from financing activities provided   and  in   and  respectively 
the company s primary sources of cash over the past several years have been i proceeds from borrowings under a line of credit facility and april   ii proceeds from the issuance of convertible debentures august   iii proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants through a private placement in september  and iv proceeds from the exercise of incentive stock options 
in  the company retired its line of credit and issued million of convertible debentures as discussed above 
during  financing activities provided  primarily from i the proceeds received on the exercise of incentive stock options in the amount of  ii the utilization of credit facilities as described below in the amount of  and iii proceeds of  received in connection with the sale of common stock and warrants as described below 
on april   the company established two separate credit facilities with silicon valley east wellesley  massachusetts a division of silicon valley bank  a california chartered bank santa clara  california 
the aggregate credit available under both facilities is million 
the banking facilities are secured by all of the company s assets 
one of the facilities is a million working capital credit line under which the company may borrow a certain percentage of its accounts receivable balance  subject to an initial cap of million that was to be removed if the company realized net income of at least  in the quarter ended september  because the company recognized a loss in the third quarter as well as the fourth quarter  this facility remains capped at million 
the second facility is a  term facility set up to help the company meet any of its capital investment requirements in the near term which include the purchase of computers and transcription related equipment 
this term note is subject to an initial cap of  with the cap being removed during such periods that the company maintains a minimum debt service ratio of to  where debt service is defined as earnings before interest and taxes plus depreciation and amortization  divided by total interest plus current portion of long term debt 
as of december  the company was not maintaining the required debt service ratio  therefore  the cap of  remains in place on this term facility 
as of december  total borrowings under both facilities totaled  the stated interest rate on the working capital facility is prime plus and the stated interest rate on the term loan is prime plus 
both of these facilities will mature on april  due to the company s financial losses  the company s borrowing capacity is currently capped at the  level of debt 
the company has been in negotiations with silicon valley to re define all of its major financial covenants and establish new borrowing capabilities with silicon valley east as a result of its third and fourth quarter losses inclusive of all one time  non recurring balance sheet adjustments 
on february   the company received full loan committee approval from coast business credit  a california based asset based lender and a division of southern pacific thrift and loan association to provide the company a million working capital facility to be effective funding capability by early april  the facility will be used to pay off silicon valley in full upon initial funding 
this new coast facility does not contain any financial covenants and is based on a funding formula for determining funding limits as follows times monthly contractual contract management revenues  plus of all medical transcription receivables under days aging 
based on current monthly contractual contract management revenues and of all medical transcription receivables under days as of february   this would provide the company with a current funding capacity of approximately million 
the facility will have a term of two years and will be priced at prime plus declining to prime plus upon two consecutive quarters of achievement and ongoing maintenance of debt service coverage of not less than times measured on an ebita basis including all principal and interest excluding depreciation 
the facility will be secured by a first security interest on all company assets 
on september   the company raised million in a private placement of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
a total of  shares of common stock were sold at a price of per share and a total of  warrants were sold at a price of per warrant to investors 
the price represents the ten day average of the closing price of the company s common stock prior to the board meeting approving the private placement 
the securities issued in the private placement were issued in reliance on certain exemptions from registration under federal and state securities laws 
the warrants have a five year term and are exercisable at a price of per share  are redeemable by the company at any time with thirty days notice during which time the holder may exercise the warrants at an exercise price of and are non transferrable 
the shares of common stock underlying the warrants and the common stock issued in the private placement carry piggy back registration rights  subject to certain limitations  in the event the company proposes to register the sale of any of its securities for its own account or for the account of its shareholders 
the company anticipates that cash on hand  together with internally generated funds  cash collected from discontinued operations and cash available under its new working capital facility with coast business credit  should be sufficient to finance continuing operations  make capital investments in the normal and ordinary course of its business  and fund the out of pocket expenses legal fees now capped of its civil litigation action against certain insurance carriers for the company will continue to pursue various alternatives to allow for the effective use of cash ie  leasing for capital asset funding 
this should help the company to i continue its rapid growth  ii achieve operating profitability and positive cash flow from operations during  and iii continue to fund the out of pocket expenses to be incurred in connection with its civil litigation against certain insurance carriers 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company to date 
however  the effects of inflation on future operating results will depend in part  on the company s ability to increase prices and or lower expenses in amounts offsetting inflationary cost increases
