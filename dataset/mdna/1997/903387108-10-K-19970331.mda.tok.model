beginning in  the company made a strategic decision to focus its efforts on the expansion of its land drilling operations to take advantage of improving market conditions and the benefits arising from a consolidation in the land drilling industry 
to effect this strategy  the company disposed of its oil field distribution business in september and immediately embarked on a directed acquisition program aimed at expanding the company s presence in the oil and gas producing regions in the united states 
since november  the company has acquired rigs in three transactions 
fwa was acquired in november for million net cash  viersen in august for approximately million consisting of million cash  a two year million note and warrants to purchase common stock at per share and the contract drilling business of quarles in january for million consisting of million cash and shares of common stock having a value of million

the company currently expects that its land drilling operations will continue to benefit from improved market conditions and the effects of its prior acquisitions 
the company intends to continue its strategy of growth through acquisitions of rigs and equipment that can be easily integrated into its fleet and operations and through acquisitions of other drilling contractors that may provide opportunities for expansion of the company s markets and services
