item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
general over the past five years  premiums written in the company s insurance operations have consistently increased  both as the result of acquisitions and through internal growth 
in the third quarter of  the company s decision to strengthen loss reserves resulted in a loss for that quarter of  otherwise  the company has reported net income in each quarter beginning with the third quarter of  when the phasing out of its prior non insurance operations was substantially completed 
increased premium volume in recent periods has been the result of the company s strategy of acquiring niche businesses and increasing premiums written in selected lines 
the company s most significant recent acquisition was its purchase in july of the redland group  inc  which provides mpci  crop hail and other named peril crop insurance and certain standard property and casualty coverages to the rural market 
following its acquisition by the company  redland has increased the volume of its mpci premium  and was the fourth largest mpci writer in the united states in mpci is a government sponsored program with accounting treatment which differs from more traditional property and casualty insurance lines 
for income statement purposes  gross premiums written consist of the aggregate amount of mpci premiums paid by farmers  and does not include any related federal premium subsidies or expense reimbursement 
the company s profit or loss from its mpci business is determined after the crop season ends on the basis of a profit sharing formula established by law and the rma 
for income statement purposes  any such profit share earned by the company  net of the cost of third party reinsurance  is shown as net premiums written  which equals net premiums earned for mpci business  whereas  any share of losses payable by the company is charged to losses and loss adjustment expenses 
due to various factors  including timing and severity of losses from storms and other natural perils and crop production cycles  the profit or loss on mpci premiums is primarily recognized in the second half of the calendar year 
the company relies on loss information from the field to determine utilizing a formula established by the rma the level of losses that should be considered in estimating the profit or loss during this period 
based upon available loss information  the company records an estimate of the profit or loss during the third quarter and then re evaluates the estimate using additional loss information available at year end to determine any remaining portion to be recorded in the fourth quarter 
all expense reimbursements received are credited to underwriting expenses 
certain characteristics of the company s crop business may affect comparisons  including i the seasonal nature of the business whereby profits or losses are generally recognized predominately in the second half of the year  ii the nature of crop business whereby losses are known within a short time period  and iii the limited amount of investment income associated with crop business 
in addition  cash flows from such business differ from cash flows from certain more traditional lines 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
the seasonal and short term nature of the company s crop business  as well as the impact on such business of weather and other natural perils  may produce more volatility in the company s operating results on a quarter to quarter or year to year basis than has historically been the case 
forward looking information except for the historical information contained in this annual report on form k  matters discussed herein may constitute forward looking information 
such forward looking information reflects the company s current best estimates regarding future operations  but  since these are only estimates  actual results may differ materially from such estimates 
a variety of events  most of which are outside the company s control  cannot be accurately predicted and may materially impact estimates of future operations 
important among such factors are weather conditions  natural disasters  changes in state and federal regulations  price competition impacting premium levels  changes in tax laws  financial market performance  changes in court decisions effecting coverages and general economic conditions 
the company s results are significantly impacted by its crop business  particularly its mpci line 
results from the crop lines are not generally known until the third and fourth quarters of the year  after crops are harvested 
crop results are particularly dependent on events beyond the company s control  notably weather conditions during the crop growing seasons in the states where the company writes a substantial amount of its crop insurance  and  with the introduction of the company s new crop revenue coverage  the market price of grains on various commodity exchanges 
additionally  federal regulations governing aspects of crop insurance are frequently modified  and any such changes may impact crop insurance results 
forward looking information set forth herein does not take into account any impact from any adverse weather conditions during the crop season  or the various other factors noted above which may affect crop and non crop operation results 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company s net income increased approximately from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  this increase in net income resulted from improved underwriting results in the company s crop and general agency divisions  growth in premium revenues  increased investment income and realized gains  and a decrease in the effective tax rate of the company 
these positive factors were offset by deteriorating results in the company s program division  increased interest expense  and a somewhat higher expense ratio for the company 
the combined underwriting loss and expense ratio improved from for the year ended december  to for the year 
this improvement in the company s combined ratio was enhanced by growth in net premiums earned of 
the greatest contribution to these improved underwriting results was made by the company s crop division 
the company s crop division increased its mpci writings from million for the year ended december  to million for the year 
in addition to this growth in mpci premium  the company increased its retained pool from million in to million in this growth in premium was aided by an increase in commodity prices for the major crops insured by the company and the introduction of an enhancement to the mpci policy  crc  which generated significantly higher premiums per policy than the traditional mpci policy 
improved weather conditions also contributed significantly to the improved results in the crop division as the company s mpci profit sharing percentage realized during increased to from realized during in addition  the year benefited from million of additional profit sharing realized in the first quarter of as final results of the late harvest were available 
underwriting results in the company s general agency division also improved in as compared to  as the company s combined ratio in this division improved from in to in the company s results were affected by a million strengthening of reserves for prior year losses see results of operations for year ended december  compared to year ended december   and million of the million affected the general agency division  contributing to the combined ratio recorded during when comparing accident year loss ratios for and in the general agency division  the results are similar 
in the year ended december   the general agency division accident year loss ratio was as compared to a accident year loss ratio of 
the general agency division was also able to improve its combined ratio through a reduction in expenses during as its expense ratio fell to in as compared to in the company also benefited from a increase in investment income during as compared to that of  and an increase in the realized investment gains of the company of when comparing the same periods 
the increase in investment income was principally due to an increase in the average size of the investment portfolio 
the average size of the company s investment portfolio increased by from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december   while the pre tax yield on the portfolio increased from in to in the size of the company s investment portfolio increased from retained earnings and positive cash flows from operations 
while the company s income tax expense increased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the year  the company s effective tax rate declined from in to in the company s taxes were positively effected by the decrease in the valuation allowance relating to the unrealized loss from the company s investment in major realty 
in october  major realty announced that its board of directors had determined that it was in the best interest of the stockholders to seek a merger partner or otherwise seek a transaction for the sale of the company 
at december   the company believed that the realization of the capital loss associated with such a transaction was more likely than not due to sufficient carryforwards of capital gains as well as the likelihood of future capital gains 
positive factors effecting net income were partially offset by deteriorating underwriting results in the company s program division 
the program division s combined loss and expense ratio increased from during to during a variety of factors combined to cause this deterioration in underwriting results 
in two of the division s departments  rural america and special products  weather related incidents increased the frequency of losses 
in the rural america department  storms in areas where the company had concentrations of farm business adversely effected the company s loss ratio  while in the company s special products department  prolonged sub zero temperatures in the greater chicago area increased the number and severity of freeze losses experienced in the company s condominium program 
the company has taken steps to reduce its geographic concentrations in the rural america department  and is making changes in the reinsurance structure of both of these departments in order to reduce volatility and improve net underwriting results 
additionally in the program division  the company changed its strategies within its workers compensation underwriting activities during in and previous years  the company had followed a strategy of depopulating assigned risk pools through the application of intensive case management techniques with risks which had become unacceptable to the standard market due to frequency rather than severity 
with the improvement of workers compensation results for the industry as a whole  more companies were willing to write workers compensation  and therefore  the number of risks fitting the company s profile for removal from assigned risk pools was substantially depleted 
during  the company moved to a strategy of partnership arrangements with select agencies in which the agent accepts part of the underwriting risk in return for an enhanced profit sharing from the company 
due to the competitive market  this strategy is developing slowly  and  thus  the company experienced a decrease in its direct written premiums in this line of business 
this transition phase caused the expense ratio in this line of business to increase more than  and resulted in an underwriting loss for this line of business 
the company believes that this line of business can return to profitability as the new partnership arrangements grow 
offsetting these deteriorating results in the program division were improved results in the company s transportation department 
within the transportation department  the company s loss and expense ratio improved from during the year ended december  to during while the department did not produce an underwriting profit  the company believes that the improvement in the company s underwriting ratios indicates that the actions taken during and to reorganize this department are having a positive effect 
the company s non standard underwriting activities experienced unprofitable results for the first time in six years as a result of an increase in both the severity and frequency of losses  particularly in the area of physical damage losses 
the company has increased rates beginning in and continuing into  reduced commissions in certain areas with poor experience  and canceled agents with loss ratio problems 
this division is also beginning to see a slow improvement in its expense ratio  and the company expects this improvement in the expense ratio to accelerate during the company s interest expense also increased during as compared to this increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the company s borrowings under its bank facility which increased from an average of million during the to million during offsetting this increase in the size of borrowings was a decline in the average interest rate under the bank facility from during to during the additional borrowings under the bank facility were contributed to the company s subsidiaries in order to support underwriting activities and maintain capital adequacy ratios at a level commensurate with the company s current a rating by am best company 
the company experienced a somewhat higher expense ratio during than during this ratio increased from in to in primarily due to higher net commission expense in the program division of the company 
this higher net commission expense was a result of a changing mix of business with a lesser percentage of premiums produced in lower commission programs such as workers compensation and transportation and a higher percentage of premiums produced in higher commission lines of business 
in addition  the company decreased the use of quota share reinsurance within the program division during during  the company expects to again increase the use of quota share reinsurance within the program division  and with the continued growth in new programs offsetting high initial expenses  expects the expense ratio of this division to fall in year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company s net income fell from the year ended december  from million in to million in this reduction in net income resulted as premium growth in the company s general agency and program divisions  an increase in investment income and an increase in underwriting profits from the company s crop division were offset by higher than expected losses in the general agency and program divisions  an increase in the company s expense ratio and a change in the company s tax status 
the company experienced strong premium growth in its general agency division as direct premiums written increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   and net premiums earned grew from to earned premiums grew more rapidly than direct premiums as premium growth slowed progressively in each quarter of the growth in this division came from the continued growth in new business produced from the company s scottsdale office which was established in late the rate of premium growth in slowed due to an increase in the competitive environment for lines of business written in the general agency division 
the company s program division also experienced excellent premium growth during as direct premiums written increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
net earned premium increased at a rate of from million in to million in this premium growth was principally from new programs established during and the company continues to seek and establish new lines of business within the program division but competitive factors in the marketplace have resulted in somewhat lower growth rates than expected in many of these new programs 
the company s non standard auto division did not grow during as premiums remained relatively stable with million in direct written premium during as compared to million during this lack of growth during resulted primarily from the company s desire to establish new computer software for its principal programs before seeking additional growth opportunities 
the company s crop division also experienced strong premium growth in as direct written premiums and net earned premiums increased and respectively from to this premium growth resulted from an increase in the federal mpci program  and increases in premium levels under the company s crop hail insurance program resulting from an increase in rates and the writing of more exposure units in certain states 
in late  congress expanded the mpci program by enacting the reform act 
the act seeks to encourage farmers to participate in the mpci program and thereby reduce dependencies on traditional disaster relief measures 
as a result  the company s mpci premium increased from million in to million in in addition  the company s mpci retention also increased from million in to million in the crop industry had experienced several years of adverse experience in the crop hail business prior to  and as a result  crop hail rates have increased while capacity has decreased 
therefore  the company was able to increase its crop hail writings from million in direct written premiums in to million in direct written premiums for the company s investment income increased from million in to million in while the company s net realized capital gains increased from million in to million in investment income increased from both an increase in the average size of the company s investment portfolio as well as an increase in the average yield on the company s fixed income investments 
the average size of the investment portfolio increased from million in to million in while the company s pre tax yield on its portfolio increased from in to in the company s investment portfolio increased from additional borrowings under the company s credit facility  positive cash flows from operations  funds from the exercise of warrants in december of as well as retained earnings 
investment yields increased as the overall interest rate environment provided higher yields during as compared to while was a difficult growing season  the company s underwriting income within its crop division increased from million in to million in this increase was a result of the growth in the mpci premium and better results in the company s hail division  offsetting negative results in the company s named peril crop programs principally from an active storm season in california during the growing season in the upper midwest was afflicted with wet weather during the planting season resulting in delayed planting of crops  followed by periods of severe heat in july  stressing newly emerging crops  and an early frost in september of no such adverse activity occurred in in addition  the reform act changed the profit sharing matrix for participants in the mpci program providing a higher degree of profit sharing  particularly for companies accepting risks in the commercial underwriting pool 
these two factors combined to change the percentage of the company s profit sharing under the mpci program from in to in this decrease in the profit sharing percentage was more than offset by the described increase in mpci premiums and improved crop hail results 
the reform act was not passed until october of  and therefore  the federal agencies charged with the oversight of the program had a limited time frame in which to enact guidelines and administrative rules and procedures for changes brought about by the reform act 
in addition  the wet planting season created additional stress on the mpci program which required further administrative changes by the federal government 
as a result  exact results of the mpci program were more difficult to estimate at december  than they had been in previous years 
the aforementioned positive factors were offset by higher than expected losses in the company s general agency and program division  including losses resulting from the strengthening of reserves during for prior year losses 
during the second quarter of  the company experienced a deterioration in the loss ratio of its commercial automobile liability business 
at that time  this was principally attributable to a more rapid emergence of losses from the year than had been expected by the company 
this trend continued in the third quarter of  and while the noted deterioration was principally in the automobile liability business  the company believed that similar deviations were likely to appear in other lines of business which develop more slowly than automobile  and therefore  the company chose in the third quarter to evaluate all major lines of business 
after an extensive study by the company in consultation with its independent actuaries  a pre tax charge of million was made in the third quarter for prior year losses 
for the year  the company increased its reserves for and prior year losses by million pre tax 
after the company completed its review of prior year losses  the new development pattern assumptions were used to estimate ultimate losses for the current accident year 
these new assumptions  severe wind and hail storms in texas during the second quarter of the year  and adverse results in a few of the company s business lines such as nursing home liability  homeowners business in south carolina and used car dealer business in california  combined to create a million underwriting loss in the property and casualty divisions of the company for the accident year 
for the accident year  the company s accident year loss ratio was for the property and casualty division 
the company s underwriting results in the non standard automobile division were fairly consistent from to with this division experiencing a loss ratio of in as compared to in management intends to continue to closely monitor statistical and other information with respect to loss reserves  in particular those lines of insurance that are more difficult to predict 
however  the estimates of loss reserves are inherently uncertain and such estimates may continue to change as more information becomes available 
underwriting expenses for increased as a percentage of earned premium from during to during general and administrative expenses also increased by million from to  and expenses in the company s crop division net of ceding commissions from reinsurers and expense reimbursements from the federal government under the mpci program decreased slightly from million in to million in the increase in the underwriting expense levels was principally attributable to increases in non standard automobile division expenses related to the implementation of new computer software programs designed to make the company s product more saleable in the marketplace and to reduce expenses in future years as the division grows 
in addition  the company sought to strengthen its information systems and audit procedures within the program and general agency divisions 
the cost of implementation of several new programs in the program division also added to the higher expense ratio for as compared to the company expects the implementation of the new computer program for the non standard automobile division as well as the investments in systems for the general agency and program divisions to begin to slowly reduce its expense ratio over the next few years 
offsetting these internal expense reductions  the company is experiencing intense competition in the area of agent s commissions as capacity in the insurance marketplace continues to exceed demand 
the company s net income during was also effected by the impact of income taxes 
the company received a benefit of million from income taxes in as opposed to an expense of million from income taxes in as a result of prior non insurance operations  the company generated significant tax loss carryforwards and other temporary differences  all of which were used by the end of liquidity and capital resources the company has included a discussion of the liquidity and capital resources requirement of the company and the insurance subsidiaries 
the company parent only as an insurance holding company  the company s assets consist primarily of the capital stock of its subsidiaries  two surplus notes issued by one of its insurance company subsidiaries and investments held at the holding company level 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are dividends and other distributions from subsidiaries  interest payments on the surplus notes  tax sharing payments from its subsidiaries and net investment income from  and proceeds from the sale of  holding company investments 
the company s liquidity needs are primarily to service debt  pay operating expenses and taxes  and make investments in subsidiaries 
dividends from the insurance subsidiaries of the company are regulated by the regulatory authorities of the states in which each subsidiary is domiciled 
the laws of such states generally restrict dividends from insurance companies to parent companies to certain statutorily approved limits 
in  the statutory limitation on dividends from insurance company subsidiaries to the parent without further insurance departmental approval is approximately million 
in addition to dividends from the insurance companies  the company also may receive distributions from its non insurance subsidiaries which are engaged in agency  premium finance and claim service operations 
the company currently holds two surplus notes  each in the amount of million  issued by one of its insurance company subsidiaries  bearing interest at the rate of per annum  payable quarterly 
although repayment of all or part of the principal of this surplus note requires prior insurance department approval  no prior approval of interest payment is currently required 
the company is currently a party to a tax sharing agreement with its subsidiaries  under which such subsidiaries pay the company amounts in general equal to the federal income tax that would be payable by such subsidiaries on a stand alone basis 
the company is also a party to a credit agreement which provides a three year revolving credit facility in amounts not to exceed million 
until july   the credit facility also included a one year term loan facility not to exceed million 
this term loan facility expired on july   as the company had not drawn upon this facility as of that date 
under the revolving credit facility  interest is payable quarterly at a rate selected by the company equal to either the prime rate or libor plus a margin which varies depending on the company s debt to equity ratio 
at december   the outstanding balance under the facility was million  with an interest cost of 
borrowings under the facility were used to provide capital for the insurance companies and to repay other debt 
the revolving credit facility expires on july   and may be extended annually by additional one year periods with the consent of the lenders 
the company is currently negotiating with its banks to restructure the credit facility to incorporate the previous term loan facility and current revolving credit facility into one credit facility 
insurance companies the principal liquidity needs of the insurance companies are to fund losses and loss adjustment expense payments and to pay underwriting expenses  including commissions and other expenses 
the available sources to fund these requirements are net premiums received and  to a lesser extent  cash flows from the company s investment activities  which together have been adequate to meet such requirements on a timely basis 
the company monitors the cash flows of the insurance companies and attempts to maintain sufficient cash to meet current operating expenses  and to structure its investment portfolio at a duration which approximates the estimated cash requirements for the payment of loss and loss adjustment expenses 
cash flows from the company s mpci and crop hail businesses differ in certain respects from cash flows associated with more traditional property and casualty lines 
mpci premiums are not received from farmers until the covered crops are harvested  and when received are promptly remitted by the company in full to the government 
covered losses are paid by the company during the growing season as incurred  with such expenditures reimbursed by the government within three business days 
policy acquisition and administration expenses are paid by the company as incurred during the year 
the company periodically throughout the year receives a payment in reimbursement of its policy acquisition and administration expenses 
the company s profit or loss from its mpci business is determined after the crop season ends on the basis of a profit sharing formula established by law and the rma 
at such time  the company receives a profit share in cash  with any amount in excess of of its mpci retention in any year carried forward to future years  or it must pay its share of losses 
the company recognized million  before private reinsurance  in profit sharing earned on the mpci business during  and in addition  recognized million during in profit sharing earned on mpci business 
in the crop hail insurance business  premiums are generally not received until after the harvest  while losses and other expenses are paid throughout the year 
changes in financial condition the naic has established a risk based capital rbc formula for property and casualty insurance companies 
the rbc initiative is designed to enhance the current regulatory framework for the evaluation of the capital adequacy of a property and casualty insurer 
the formula requires an insurer to compute the amount of capital necessary to support four areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers a asset risk default on fixed income assets and market decline  b credit risk losses from unrecoverable reinsurance and inability to collect agents balances and other receivables  c underwriting risk premium pricing and reserve estimates  and d off balance sheet growth risk excessive premium growth and unreported liabilities 
the insurance companies have reviewed and applied the rbc formula for the year and have exceeded these requirements 
the company s stockholder s equity increased by approximately or million from december  to december  the principal components of this change in stockholder s equity were an increase in the company s retained earnings from an accumulated deficit at december  of million to retained earnings of million at december   an increase in capital in excess of par value of million as a result of the exercise of certain outstanding warrants and stock options  and an increase in the company s unrealized loss on available for sale securities  net of tax  of million 
consolidated cash flows cash flows from operations for the year ended december  were million as compared to cash flows from operating activities of million during the positive cash flows for both and have provided adequate capital to meet all of the company s cash needs 
cash flows from the company s mpci and crop hail business are different in certain respects from cash flows associated with more traditional property and casualty lines see liquidity and capital resources  insurance companies
