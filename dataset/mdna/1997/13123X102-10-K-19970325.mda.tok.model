item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s revenues  profitability and future growth and the carrying value of its oil and gas properties are substantially dependent on prevailing prices of oil and gas 
the company s ability to maintain or increase its borrowing capacity and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is also influenced by oil and gas prices 
prices for oil and gas are subject to large fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond the control of the company 
these factors include weather conditions in the united states  the condition of the united states economy  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  governmental regulation  political stability in the middle east and elsewhere  the foreign supply of crude oil and natural gas  the price of foreign imports and the availability of alternate fuel sources 
any substantial and extended decline in the price of crude oil or natural gas would have an adverse effect on the company s carrying value of its proved reserves  borrowing capacity  revenues  profitability and cash flows from operations 
volatile oil and gas prices make it difficult to estimate the value of producing properties for acquisition and often cause disruption in the market for oil and gas producing properties  as buyers and sellers have difficulty agreeing on such value 
price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on acquisitions and development and exploitation projects 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of capital are its cash flows from operations  borrowings from financial institutions and sale of equity securities 
cash provided from operations during totaled million 
during  the company borrowed million from financial institutions and repaid such borrowing with the proceeds from the sale of  in senior sub ordinated notes in november  at december   the company had working capital in the amount of million 
effective october   the company entered into a new credit facility with chase manhattan bank 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by mortgages covering substantially all of the company s producing oil and gas properties 
the credit facility provides for borrowings of a maximum of the lesser of million or a borrowing base borrowing base determined periodically on the basis of a discounted present value of future net cash flows attributable to the company s proved producing oil and gas reserves 
through may   the credit facility provides a million borrowing base 
pursuant to the credit facility  depending upon the percentage of the unused portion of the borrowing base  the interest rate is equal to either the lender s prime rate or the lender s prime rate plus 
the company  at its option  may fix the interest rate on all or a portion of the outstanding principal balance at either or above a defined eurodollar rate  depending upon the percentage of the unused portion of the borrowing base  for periods of up to six months 
the weighted average interest rate for the total debt outstanding at december  was 
under the credit facility  a commitment fee of 
or 
per annum on the unused portion of the borrowing base depending upon the percentage of the unused portion of the borrowing base is payable quarterly 
the company may borrow  pay  reborrow and repay under the credit facility until october   on which date  the company must repay in full all amounts then outstanding 
at december   the unpaid balance due on the credit facility was  on november   the company issued  of senior subordinated notes that will mature december  the company used the proceeds to pay down the credit facility and for other corporate purposes 
interest is payable quarterly beginning march  the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  on or after december   at of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued interest to the redemption date 
the notes are general unsecured obligations of the company  subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the company 
the credit facility and the subordinated debt contain various covenants including restrictions on additional indebtedness and payment of cash dividends as well as maintenance of certain financial ratios 
over the past seven years  the company has established relationships with institutional investors which have been important to its producing property acquisition strategy 
the company believes these relationships provide it with the ability to make larger acquisitions than would otherwise be possible 
in a typical transaction  the company will acquire a working interest and burden the working interest with a net profits interest transferred to the institu tional investor 
the arrangements generally provide that the company earns an increased interest in the properties either at the time of closing or after the institution receives a certain level of distributions 
the company also receives operating and property management fees from its institutional investors and joint interest partners which enables the company to maintain a larger and more experienced staff 
capital expenditures for totaled million which included million of lease acquisitions  million for the acquisition of producing properties and equipment and million for property development and drilling activities on new and previously existing properties 
over the past two years  the company has shifted its focus from acquisition of producing properties to the acquisition of acreage with development and drilling opportunities 
therefore  future capital expenditure requirements will depend somewhat on exploration results 
the company s plans for include capital expenditures equal to or greater than those amounts expended for the current year 
projected cash flow from operations and borrowings under the company s credit facility are anticipated to be sufficient to fund this capital budget  however  the company will consider alternative sources of financing 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information with respect to the oil and gas operations of the company for the three year period ended december  december  production oil mbbls gas mmcf    total production mmcfe    average sales price oil per bbl gas per mcf total production per mcfe average costs per mcfe lease operating expense excluding severance taxes severance taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative net of management fees comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and oil and gas revenue oil and gas sales increased million  or  during to million compared to million in while oil and gas production volumes for were lower than those reported in  substantial price increases in both oil and gas more than offset the loss in revenues 
the average sales price per barrel sold in increased to  compared to for the average sales price per mcf of gas sold increased from in to in oil production for decreased slightly to  barrels from the  barrels produced in this reduction was primarily attributable to the implementation of the required environmental protection program zero discharge at our black bay complex  the company s largest single oil producing prospect 
during this process  several producing wells were shut in while various new equipment was installed 
in addition  several wells were temporarily shut in while repairs were conducted on the service lines 
therefore  average daily production for dropped to  barrels per day compared to  barrels per day in gas production for was bcf  a decrease from the bcf reported in this reduction was primarily attributable to the loss of production from the north dauphin island field where problems with excess water content in the gas sales stream were encountered early in the year requiring the installation of a dehydrator and removal of water from the lines 
extraneous water produc tion from the a well led to the shut in of the well and the natural decline of the reservoir pressure 
also during the year  this field incurred a lower production rate due to compressor inefficiencies which led to a compressor restaging program that was completed in late september 
lease operating expenses lease operating expenses  including severance taxes  increased from million in to million in a large portion of this increase   is attributable to normal expenses associated with new property additions

oil production from the newly acquired interest in the black bay complex  the escambia minerals properties and the w t properties substantially outweighed normal production declines in previously existing properties  as oil production for increased to  barrels from the level of  barrels 
the average price per barrel sold also increased by in compared to prices  resulting in a total million increase in oil revenues 
total gas production increased bcf to bcf in compared to bcf in a substantial portion of this increase in production was attributable to the company s acquisition of the north dauphin island field
