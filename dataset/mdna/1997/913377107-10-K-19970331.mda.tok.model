liquidity and capital resources the company s need for capital has historically been to maintain or increase the surplus of its insurance subsidiaries and to support the company as an insurance holding company  including the maintenance of its status as a public company 
in addition  the company requires capital to fund its anticipated growth through acquisitions of other companies and blocks of insurance business 
the company the company requires cash to pay the operating expenses necessary to support its status as an insurance holding company which under applicable insurance department regulations must bear its own expenses and to meet the cost involved in being a publicly owned company and will require cash to meet universal s obligations under the unstacking agreement and the debentures to be issued thereunder 
the million of cash required to fund the initial segment of the unstacking agreement is expected to be provided by the sale of at least million of series c preferred stock  the completion of which is awaiting approval of the transaction by the florida insurance department 
on september   the company amended its loan agreement with its commercial bank  under which amendment  the company borrowed  on a one year term loan  extendable by the company for a second year

as of december  and december    was outstanding on this loan agreement  which bears interest at over prime 
insurance subsidiaries american progressive and american pioneer are required to maintain minimum amounts of capital and surplus as determined by statutory accounting 
the minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements of american progressive and american pioneer as of december  for the maintenance of authority to do business were  and  respectively  but substantially more than this is needed to permit continued writing of new business 
at december  the adjusted statutory capital and surplus  including asset valuation reserve  of american progressive and american pioneer were  and  respectively 
the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc rules which became effective december  and have been adopted by both new york and florida 
see regulationcrisk based capital requirements the new rbc rules provide for various actions when the ratio of a company s total adjusted surplus to its rbc falls below 
at december   american progressive and american pioneer had rbc ratios of approximately and of the authorized control level  respectively

liquidity for the life insurance subsidiaries is measured by their ability to pay scheduled contractual benefits  pay operating expenses  and fund investment commitments 
sources of liquidity include scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on investments  premium payments and deposits and the sale of liquid investments 
these sources of liquidity for the insurance subsidiaries significantly exceed scheduled uses 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including death benefits  benefits under accident and health policies and interest sensitive policy surrenders and withdrawals 
the amount of surrenders and withdrawals is affected by a variety of factors such as credited interest rates for similar products  general economic conditions and events in the industry which affect policyholders confidence 
although the contractual terms of substantially all of the company s in force life insurance policies and annuities give the holders the right to surrender the policies and annuities  the company imposes penalties for early surrenders 
at december  the company held reserves that exceeded the underlying cash surrender values of its in force life insurance and annuities by more than million 
the insurance companies have not experienced any material changes in surrender and withdrawal activity in recent years 
changes in interest rates may affect the incidence of policy surrenders and withdrawals 
in addition to the potential impact on liquidity  unanticipated surrenders and withdrawals in a changed interest rate environment could adversely affect earnings if the company were required to sell investments at reduced values in order to meet liquidity demands 
the company manages the asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings impact of changing market rates 
the company seeks to invest in assets which have duration and interest spread characteristics similar to the liabilities which they support 
the net yield on cash and invested assets increased from in to in a significant portion of these securities are held to support the liabilities for policyholder account balances  which liabilities are subject to periodic adjustments to their credited interest rates 
the credited interest rates of the interest sensitive policyholder account balances are determined by management based upon factors such as portfolio rates of return and prevailing market rates and typically follow the pattern of yields on the assets supporting these liabilities 
at december   the investment portfolios of the life insurance subsidiaries included cash and short term investments totaling  as well as fixed maturity securities that could readily be converted to cash with carrying values and fair values of  the fair values of these liquid investments totalled more than  and constituted approximately of the company s investments at december  at december   all of the company investments were income producing and current in interest and principal payments except for one security with a carrying value of  in addition  the company has no investment in any derivative instruments or other hybrid securities that contain any off balance sheet risk or investments in other securities whose fair values and principal repayments would be highly volatile to changes in interest rates  except for gnma s  fnma s and investment grade corporate collateralized mortgage obligations 
worldnet in february   the service agreement between worldnet and ontario blue cross obc  which had been entered into in in connection with worldnet s purchase of certain assets from subsidiaries of obc was terminated 
the termination of the service agreement was the result of the acquisition of obc by liberty mutual insurance company liberty health in simultaneously with the termination of the service agreement  liberty mutual agreed to cancel certain promissory notes executed on april  as part payment for the acquired assets  which had a balance of  at december  at the same time  the company wrote off the corresponding assets  including the value of the  the resulting net income from this transaction was approximately  through december   the company had provided approximately million to worldnet with no additional funding required during these funds were used to support worldnet s start up costs  a portion of the costs of acquiring the hat assets and the cost of acquiring worldnet s dallas  texas facility and later closing it and relocating certain of its operations to the facility purchased from hat in miami beach  florida 
worldnet s revenues were   and  for  and  respectively 
worldnet incurred a net loss of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the loss included certain non cash expenses amounting to  effects of accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement  accounting for certain debt and equity securities  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
statement requires that debt and equity securities be classified into three categories and accounted for as follows debt securities that the company has the positive intent and the ability to hold to maturity would be classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
debt and equity securities that are held for current resale would be classified as trading securities and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt and equity securities not classified as held to maturity or as trading securities would be classified as available for sale and reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses would not be reflected in earnings but would be reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the company adopted statement on january   the effect of which increased its unrealized gains by  in november   the fasb issued a special report titled a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which report allows enterprises to reassess the appropriateness of the classifications of all securities held and account for any resulting reclassifications between the investment accounts 
this one time reassessment had to be made prior to december  and be appropriately disclosed in the financial statements 
in december   the company did reassess the appropriateness of the classifications of its securities and reclassified all of the securities contained in the held to maturity account to the available for sale account as they may be considered for sale prior to maturity as part of the asset liability management strategy 
the carrying value of the securities reclassed to available for sale amounted to  and the fair value amounted to  this transfer resulted in the company increasing its unrealized gains by  as changes in interest rates occur  the carrying value of the securities classified as available for sale  as well as any securities which may in the future be classified as held for maturity  will be impacted 
typically  as interest rates rise  the carrying value of these securities may decline 
conversely  if interest rates decline  the carrying value of these securities may increase 
management cannot predict the impact that changes in future interest rates will have on the company s financial statements 
in october   the fasb issued statement  accounting for stock based compensation statement which requires companies to recognize compensation expense for stock options based on their fair value on the date of grant and is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
statement allows companies to remain under the existing method of accounting for stock options  accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
if companies elect to remain under apb then the companies are required to disclose the pro forma effects of statement on their net income and earnings per share resulting from the grant of these options and other stock awards 
under apb  to the extent the exercise price of the company s stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
the company has elected to follow apb and related interpretations in accounting for its stock options and will disclose the pro forma effects of statement on the company s net income and earnings per share in the footnotes to the financial statements 
the pro forma effects of statement result in additional compensation expense for december  and of  and  respectively 
the results of which reduce earnings per share for december  and  on a pro forma basis  and  respectively
