in thousands year ended december  rmb rmb rmb rmb unaudited unaudited audited audited pro forma pro forma historical historical sales distribution of natural rubber     procurement of materials and supplies and distribution of other agricultural products     gross profit excluding sales tax     gross profit margin income before income taxes     income taxes     net income before minority interests     minority interests     net income after minority interests     year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales and gross profit total net sales for the year ended december   decreased slightly by rmb million or to rmb  million  compared to rmb  million for the corresponding period in net sales of natural rubber declined by rmb million or to rmb  million  compared to rmb  million for the corresponding period in the decline in natural rubber sales has been partially offset by the increase in procurement of materials and supplies 
net sales revenue for the procurement of materials and supplies increased significantly by rmb million or to rmb million  compared to rmb million for the corresponding period in as previously discussed  the natural rubber market in was not as favorable as in because of a weakened domestic rubber consumption market and a decline in the domestic natural rubber price caused by the large influx of imported natural rubber 
the quantity of natural rubber sales decreased by approximately  tons or to  tons  compared to  tons for the corresponding period in the unit price of natural rubber decreased from approximately rmb  per ton at the beginning of to approximately rmb  per ton by the end of during the third quarter of the year  the company deliberately stockpiled natural rubber in anticipation of an upward price movement during the fourth quarter  when output is generally lower 
however  the domestic price of natural rubber continued to be low during the fourth quarter because of the large influx of imported rubber during the fourth quarter 
following the completion of the company s private offshore placements on march and july   portions of the net proceeds from the offerings were invested into harc and the operating subsidiaries as working capital to expand the distribution operations 
during the year  the company has expanded into trading of other agricultural products  such as coffee beans which were in high demand in china as a result of the active trading of coffee commodity futures in china 
during the year  a quantity of approximately  tons of coffee beans were sold and a net sales revenue of approximately rmb million was recorded  which carried an average gross profit of approximately 
the corresponding sales revenue was recorded under the procurement of materials and supplies 
if sales of these agricultural products were excluded  net sales revenue from procurement of materials and supplies would drop by approximately rmb million or to rmb million in from rmb million in the decline was mainly due to the prolonged enforcement of the macroeconomic austerity measures implemented by the central government since mid to rein in the overheated chinese economy  which has hampered the domestic consumption and demand for materials and supplies 
gross profits increased by rmb million or to rmb million in from rmb million in the overall gross profit margin also increased from in to in the increase was primarily attributable to the high gross profit margin earned from the trading of agricultural products 
the gross profit margin on natural rubber distribution was down to in from on due to competition from imported natural rubber 
the company has mitigated the effect of adverse price movement for domestic rubber on the gross profit margin by entering into rubber futures contracts to hedge against the price risk associated with the holding of rubber inventory  rubber purchase commitments and anticipation of rubber purchases 
the purchase discounts received from the farms  as well as the gross profit margin guarantee  also helped to shield the company against the effect of the drop in natural rubber prices on gross profit margins 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased by rmb million or to rmb million in from rmb million in pursuant to the restructuring agreements effective on october   the company strategically consolidated and rationalized its various trading divisions in order to streamline its business operations and improve cost control

financial expenses  net the net financial expenses decreased by rmb or to rmb million in from rmb million in the decrease in net financial expenses was primarily attributable to the reduction in bank interest expenses commencing in the fourth quarter of following the execution of the restructuring agreements effective on october  according to the restructuring agreements  all outstanding bank loans of the operating subsidiaries were deemed assigned to the farming bureau  together with the assignment of certain accounts receivable from the farms and certain affiliates of the farming bureau 
as a result  all bank interest incurred by the operating subsidiaries commencing october   was borne by the farming bureau 
other income  net other income decreased by rmb million or to rmb million in from rmb million in this significant reduction in other income was primarily due to the reduction in profit from the trading of commodity futures contracts for non hedging purposes 
a profit on the trading of commodity futures of rmb million was recorded for the year  compared to a profit of only rmb million for the year in addition  a service fee of rmb million was paid to the farming bureau in accordance with the agreement on service and cooperation entered into between the farming bureau and harc dated november  the agreement stipulates that the farming bureau is entitled to a service fee up to a maximum of rmb million  calculated at a rate of of harc s annual net income before the service fee  as determined in accordance with us gaap  provided that the annual net income of harc exceeds rmb million after deducting such fee

the increase in sales was mainly the result of an increase in natural rubber sales of rmb million or over last year  while sales of materials and supplies remained approximately unchanged as compared to last year 
the increase in rubber sales was mainly due to the increase in sales quantity from  tons in to  tons in  which was in line with a general increase in demand for natural rubber in the prc 
in addition  the increase in the average natural rubber selling price from approximately rmb  per ton in to rmb  per ton in also contributed to the overall increase in rubber sales 
the proportion of materials and supplies sales to total sales remained low as a result of the sustained effect of the macroeconomic austerity measures introduced by the prc government in late  which has caused a sharp decrease in sales of production materials since late the increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to the increase in the gross profit margin of natural rubber sales from in to in this increase was mainly the result of purchase discounts of rmb million received from farms pursuant to the agreement on rubber purchase deposits among the farming bureau  first supply  second supply and harc dated march  there were no purchase discounts before march  selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses consisted mainly of wages and salaries  staff welfare  printing and stationery  pension contributions  entertainment  professional fees  repairs and maintenance  travel expenses and outward freight charges 
selling and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were rmb million compared with rmb million for that of  representing an increase of 
the increase was mainly due to increases in salaries and staff welfare expenses  which amounted to rmb million  increases in entertainment and office expenses  which amounted to rmb million  and other miscellaneous expenses resulting from an increase in the number of employees and inflation

interest expenses increased by rmb million  or  from rmb million for the year ended december   to rmb million for the corresponding period in the increase was due principally to an increase in the bank loan interest rate since mid interest income decreased by rmb million  or from rmb million for the year ended december   to rmb million for the corresponding period in the decrease was due mainly to the sharp decline in financing to the hainan state farms after the agreement on rubber purchase deposits  pursuant to which purchase deposits have been maintained 
other income other income increased by rmb million  from rmb million for the year ended december   to rmb million for the corresponding period in the increase was primarily due to an increase in net gains on trading of natural rubber futures contracts and an increase in management fees income 
the operating subsidiaries principally engage in the marketing and distribution of natural rubber  and they engage in the trading of natural rubber commodities futures contracts to hedge the price risk associated with certain firm commitments for the purchase of natural rubber 
however  as opportunities arise  the operating subsidiaries also enter into natural rubber commodities futures contracts that are not specific hedges  in anticipation of a rise or fall in the price of natural rubber  based on their knowledge of the supply and demand situation with respect to natural rubber in the prc 
for the year ended december   the operating subsidiaries realized a net gain on such transactions of rmb million  which was classified as other income 
for the year ended december   management fees of rmb  were charged to two companies owned and controlled by the farming bureau for their share of the operating subsidiaries administrative expenses and for the use of the operating subsidiaries office equipment  warehouse and staff 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the following discussion and analysis  the comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and is on a pro forma basis 
sales and gross profit for the year ended december   total turnover was rmb  million compared with rmb  million for the corresponding period in this indicates a rise in sales by rmb million  representing an increase of as compared with the corresponding period last year 
as far as the sales of rubber are concerned  they increased by rmb million or as compared with the corresponding period last year 
the increase was mainly due to the worldwide contraction in the supply of rubber in with demand grows continuously 
the unit price of rubber has risen to a historical high of rmb  per ton 
the average unit price of domestic rubber for was rmb  compared with that of rmb  in this accounted for the growth in sales of rubber for the year ended december  turnover for production materials for the year ended december   was rmb million compared with rmb million in the corresponding period last year  representing a decrease of rmb million  or as compared with last year 
the decrease was mainly attributed to the drastic fall in the sales of production materials  in particular  the building materials  due to the nationwide contraction in capital investment as a result of the implementation of a series of austerity measures by the central government to combat inflation 
the greatest impact of the measures was on the real estate market which was further worsened by the introduction of the new property gain tax system 
the effect of decrease in turnover for production materials on total turnover was to a certain extent eliminated by the rise in turnover of rubber 
in the past  the selling prices of rubber were set by the farming bureau in order to allow a pre determined profit margin 
commencing in  the selling prices were allowed to fluctuate according to market demand and supply  subject to minimum gross profit margin of with respect to natural rubber purchased from the hainan state farms 
in  an overall gross profit margin of was generated 
in  a higher gross profit margin of was generated 
the higher gross profit margin was due mainly to a large quantity of rubber inventory which was previously purchased at lower prices and was on hand at the end of this inventory was then sold in at the higher prevailing selling price as determined by the farming bureau 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were rmb million compared with rmb million for that of  representing an increase of 
the increase was mainly due to increases in salaries and staff welfare expenses  amounted to rmb million  and increases in miscellaneous expenses due to inflation and increases in the number of divisions of the operating subsidiaries  which amounted to rmb million 
interest income expenses interest expenses were derived from the short term bank loans borrowed by the operating subsidiaries which were mainly used to finance the working capital needs of the hainan state farms 
interest income was derived from bank deposits and the provision of funds to the hainan state farms through the current accounts with the hainan state farms 
interest expenses increased by rmb million  or  to rmb million for the year ended december   from rmb million for the corresponding period in the increase is due principally to an increase in the interest rate from the second half of forward and an increase in the bank loan for the financing of the working capital 
interest income increased by rmb million  or to rmb million for the year ended december   from rmb million for the corresponding period in interest income increased more than the interest expenses because of the bank interest earned on the cash contribution of rmb million from billion luck to harc and the penalty interest charged on overdue accounts receivable balances 
liquidity and capital resources the operating subsidiaries primary liquidity needs are to fund accounts receivable  inventories  rubber purchase deposits and  to a lesser extent  to expand business operations 
the operating subsidiaries have financed their working capital requirements through a combination of internally generated cash and short term bank borrowing 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was rmb million  rmb million and rmb million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash flows from the operating subsidiaries operating activities are attributable to the operating subsidiaries income and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the substantial increase in cash used in operating activities in was mainly due to the increase in purchase deposits paid to hainan state farms pursuant to the agreement on rubber purchase deposits and to the increase in inventory held at the year end in anticipation of a higher selling price for natural rubber during the non harvest season in early however  the domestic price of natural rubber continued to be low during the first quarter of because of the large influx of imported natural rubber and weakened domestic demand 
the operating subsidiaries have outstanding bank loans with hainan province agricultural bank sales division  and haikou city agricultural bank xiuyin sub branch 
these loans amounted to rmb million as at december   bearing a weighted average interest rate of per annum 
the bank loans are generally secured by a guarantee given by the farming bureau and mature not more than one year after such loans are originally made 
prior to mid  the farming bureau generally undertook the financing obligations with respect to the hainan state farms and  therefore  the bank loans of the operating subsidiaries were insignificant 
afterwards  large amounts of funds from bank loans have been borrowed by the operating subsidiaries which are used to finance the hainan state farms operation and to finance the sale of production materials to the hainan state farms 
on march   harc  first supply and second supply entered into an agreement with the farming bureau pursuant to which the farming bureau guarantees the supply of a minimum of  tons the guaranteed quantity of natural rubber for each of the following three years 
the operating subsidiaries are not obligated to purchase the guaranteed quantity 
in consideration of this guarantee  the operating subsidiaries have maintained a purchase deposit on a rolling basis which is equivalent to the guaranteed quantity multiplied by the average market price for natural rubber for the previous quarter 
in return  a purchase discount is offered to the operating subsidiaries for the purchase of natural rubber from the hainan state farms 
the farming bureau has guaranteed the availability of alternative financing for the operating subsidiaries to meet their liabilities in the event that the banks demand repayment of their outstanding loans  and it has guaranteed the recoverability of current accounts receivable from the hainan state farms and other related companies controlled and owned by the farming bureau 
pursuant to the restructuring agreements  harc and the operating subsidiaries agreed to assign to the farming bureau the amounts due from the farms and the affiliates of the farming bureau as of september   and the farming bureau agreed to assume the obligations under the short term bank loans  as part of the corporate restructuring plan 
the assignment of amounts due from farms and affiliates of the farming bureau was effective on october   and the assumption of short term bank loans will be effective upon approval of such banks  but no later than march  under the restructuring agreements  the farming bureau had to obtain the banks approval of the assumptions 
as of september   the aggregate amount due from the farms and affiliates of the farming bureau amounted to approximately rmb million us million  and the short term bank loans amounted to approximately rmb million us million 
according to the restructuring agreements  the farming bureau will be responsible for the payment of interest incurred on the bank loans after september  on march   and march   the operating subsidiaries obtained approvals from the relevant banks for the assumptions of the bank loans by the farming bureau 
during the year ended december   the company issued  shares of series b convertible preferred stock  par value us per share  at a price of us  per share  resulting in gross proceeds of us million 
the terms of the series b convertible preferred stock  and other information concerning the sale of such stock  were set forth in the company s two forms k dated march  and july   and are incorporated herein by reference 
as of december   all shares of the series b convertible preferred stock were converted to shares of common stock  and no shares of series b convertible preferred stock are currently authorized or outstanding 
the currently outstanding shares of series b preferred stock have rights  preferences and limitations that are completely different from those of the series b convertible preferred stock 
see exhibits and attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference 
the company believes that the net proceeds from its capital raising efforts  together with the internally generated funds  will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated working capital needs for at least the next months 
inflation inflation has historically not had a material effect on the operating subsidiaries operations 
when the price of rubber or production materials has increased  these costs historically have been passed on to the customers 
furthermore  because the operating subsidiaries do not have either long term supply contracts or long term contracts with customers  prices are quoted based on the prevailing market price determined by supply and demand 
accordingly  the company does not anticipate any material effect on its future revenues due to inflation  however  such inflation has generally resulted in upward pressure on wages and salary to employees
