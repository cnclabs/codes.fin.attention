the company had approximately million of financial resources available at the holding company level at december   which are primarily comprised of investments in the common stock of its non insurance subsidiaries 
the assets of these non insurance subsidiaries are primarily invested in balances with independent investment managers and marketable securities 
substantially  all of the amounts invested with independent investment managers are withdrawable at least annually  subject to applicable notice requirements 
a shelf registration is also in effect under which up to million in securities may be issued by the company 
other sources of liquidity at the holding company level include interest and principal payments made on a surplus debenture the surplus debenture issued by rslic texas to the company  dividends paid from insurance subsidiaries  primarily generated from operating cash flows and investments  and borrowings available under the credit agreement 
at december   the unpaid principal balance of the surplus debenture  which is payable in quarterly installments through december   was million 
rslic texas generates less than of the company s premiums  policyholder fees and deposits  therefore  payments on the surplus debenture are generally funded by dividend payments made by rslic to rslic texas 
these dividends are subject to regulatory restrictions and  in the absence of regulatory approval  are generally limited within any month period  in the aggregate  to the greater of rslic s statutory net income for the preceding calendar year  or of rslic s statutory surplus as of the preceding december  determined in accordance with state regulations

the company actively pursues acquisitions of blocks of business and insurance and financial services companies that complement or may otherwise be strategically consistent with its existing business 
the company routinely engages in discussions with respect to certain potential transactions  any of which could  if consummated  be material to the company s operations 
sources of liquidity available to the company on a parent company only basis  including the undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries  scheduled payments under the surplus debenture and additional borrowings available under the credit agreement  are expected to exceed the company s cash requirements for the principal liquidity requirements of the company s insurance subsidiaries are  in the cases of rslic  frslic and sncc  their contractual obligations to policyholders and contractholders  and in the case of rslic texas  its payments to the company on the surplus debenture 
the primary sources of funding for these obligations  in addition to operating earnings  are the marketable investments included in the investment portfolios of rslic  frslic and sncc

the discontinuance of this business is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity in the future 
investments 
the company s overall investment strategy to achieve its objectives of safety and liquidity  while seeking the best available return  focuses on  among other things  managing the durations of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities and minimizing the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company has de emphasized the use of reverse repurchase agreements and has reduced its liabilities under these agreements from million at december  to million at december  the company s investment portfolio primarily consists of investments in fixed maturity securities 
the weighted average credit rating of the company s fixed maturity portfolio as rated by standard poor s corporation was aa at december  while the investment grade rating of the company s fixed maturity portfolio addresses credit risk  it does not address other risks  such as prepayment and extension risks  which are discussed below 
during the year ended december   the company s investments in mortgage backed securities decreased to of total invested assets  or million  as compared to of total invested assets  or  million  at december  this decrease resulted from the sale of million of mortgage backed securities and the acquisition of sig s investment portfolio  which totaled million at december  approximately of the company s mortgage backed securities are guaranteed by us government sponsored entities as to the full amount of principal and interest 
the remaining of the mortgage backed portfolio consists of investments in trusts created by banks and finance and mortgage companies 
ninety nine percent of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio  based on fair value  have been rated as investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
the single largest investment in mortgage backed securities backed by a single mortgage pool totaled million  or of total invested assets  at december  the company s holdings include certain privately placed mortgage backed securities  the fair value of which totaled million at december  although there is an additional degree of liquidity risk associated with privately placed securities  the company believes that  if necessary  it could liquidate all or a portion of its investments in these securities in a timely manner at or close to market value 
the company has not experienced any material write downs in its mortgage backed portfolio 
mortgage backed securities subject the company to a degree of interest rate risk  including prepayment and extension risk  which is generally a function of the sensitivity of each security s underlying collateral to prepayments under varying interest rate environments and the repayment priority of the securities in the particular securitization structure 
the company seeks to limit the extent of this risk by emphasizing the more predictable payment classes and securities with stable collateral 
in addition  the company has developed a hedging program to assist it in managing the duration of its mortgage backed securities 
the hedging program utilizes short positions in us treasury futures contracts to reduce the company s interest rate risk  effectively shortening the duration of the company s mortgage backed securities 
at december   the company maintained mortgage backed securities with a weighted average duration of years  after giving effect to hedging activities  in line with the duration of its interest sensitive liabilities 
the duration of the company s mortgage backed securities without the hedging instruments was approximately years 
at december   realized losses on closed futures positions totaling million and unrealized gains on open futures positions totaling million have been deferred and recorded as adjustments to the amortized cost of the mortgage backed securities being hedged and will be amortized into investment income over the expected term of the securities being hedged 
the company has also developed a hedging program to reduce the interest rate risk associated with its municipal securities portfolio 
this hedging program utilizes short positions in us treasury futures contracts and limits the interest rate risk associated with its investments in trusts comprised of municipal securities 
the short futures contracts hedging these securities have a net deferred realized loss on closed positions of million and an unrealized gain on open positions of million which have been recorded as adjustments to the amortized cost of the municipal securities being hedged and will be amortized into investment income over the expected term of the securities being hedged 
the company maintains an investment program in which securities have been financed using advances from the fhlb 
the company has utilized this program to manage the duration of its liabilities and to earn spread income  which is the difference between the financing cost and the earnings from the securities purchased with those funds 
the advances from the fhlb  which are at a fixed rate  had an average term to maturity of years 
this program requires the company to maintain securities on deposit with the fhlb as collateral for the advances outstanding 
as the fair value of those securities increases or decreases  the company may be allowed to retake possession of securities or be required to deposit additional securities 
the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to make investments is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of their respective state of domicile 
each of these states has comprehensive investment regulations 
in addition  the credit agreement and  as to sncc  the sig senior notes also contain limitations  with which the company is currently in compliance in all material respects  on the composition of the company s investment portfolio 
the company also continually monitors its investment portfolio and attempts to ensure that the risks associated with concentrations of investments in either a particular sector of the market or a single entity are limited 
asset liability management 
a significant aspect of the company s continued profitability is its ability to manage risks associated with interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
the company prices its annuity products based on assumptions concerning prevailing and expected interest rates and other factors to achieve a positive difference  or spread  between its expected return on investments and the crediting rate 
the company achieves this spread by active portfolio management focusing on matching the durations of invested assets and related liabilities to minimize the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and by the adjustment of the crediting rate on annuity products 
the results of this asset liability matching are analyzed periodically through cash flow analysis under multiple interest rate scenarios 
the company believes that it will continue to achieve a positive spread and that the amount of lapses and surrender rates will remain consistent with those assumed in the pricing of the products
