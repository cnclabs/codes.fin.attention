item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition wesco s shareholders equity at december  was billion or per share  up million or per share for the year 
this increase was due principally to appreciation in market value of investments  which under accounting convention is credited directly to shareholders equity  net of taxes  without being reflected in earnings 
because unrealized appreciation is recorded using current market quotations  which are subject to fluctuation  or estimated fair values  the net gains ultimately realized could differ substantially from recorded unrealized appreciation  which constituted of shareholders equity at december   compared to at december  and at december  even if unrealized appreciation is ignored  the financial condition of wesco and its subsidiaries continues to be sound and liquid 
borrowings from banks and others have been available to wesco and its subsidiaries under attractive terms for a number of years 
in recognition of the sound financial condition of wesco and of its wes fic insurance subsidiary  wesco s million of notes due november and wes fic s claims paying ability have since been assigned standard poor corporation s highest rating  aaa 
ms property is in process of liquidating foreclosed real estate and real estate loans acquired from mutual savings in december in addition  ms property and wesco are contingently liable for at least of any losses that may be sustained by cenfed on collection of real estate loans sold by mutual savings to cenfed in october the managements of ms property and wesco believe any net overall loss on disposition of these items would not be material 
wesco is not now suffering from inflation  but its insurance and industrial segments have potential exposure 
very large unanticipated changes in the rate of inflation could adversely impact the insurance business  because premium rates are often established well in advance of expenditures 
also  wesco s consolidated balance sheet contains substantial unrealized appreciation of investments  investment values  in particular that of freddie mac  are considered sensitive to general interest rate changes 
precision steel s steel service businesses are competitive and operate on tight gross profit margins  and thus its earnings are susceptible to bad effects from inflationary cost increases 
results of operations see item  business  for a discussion of wesco s operations and events that resulted in a restructuring of the consolidated enterprise  reflected in the consolidated financial statements as of the beginning of the following summary sets forth the contribution to consolidated net income of each of wesco s business segments  insurance and industrial  and of wesco s nonsegment activities 
in each case unusual items ie  securities gains  losses and writedowns are shown separately from normal net operating income 
amounts are in thousands  all after income tax effect

in the following sections the normal net operating income data set forth in the foregoing summary on an after tax basis are broken down and discussed 
attention is directed to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information as to operating profit before taxes 
insurance segment the normal net operating income of the insurance segment ie  wes fic and  since july  kbs represents the combination of underwriting results with dividend and interest income 
following is a summary of such data in thousands year ended december  premiums written    premiums earned    underwriting gain    dividend and interest income    income before income taxes    income tax provision    normal net operating income    premiums written by the insurance group for were comprised of million attributable to kbs and million attributable to wes fic  mainly relating to its participation in a super catastrophe policy covering hurricane risk in florida for a twelve month period beginning june   retroceded by national fire 
premiums written in and consisted almost entirely of premiums from super catastrophe policies retroceded by nico 
the decline in super catastrophe retrocessions from berkshire subsidiaries from to resulted principally from increased competition berkshire s management has stated repeatedly that it will not knowingly write business at inadequate rates 
as explained in item  business  wes fic accepted a participation in another  larger  florida hurricane super catastrophe policy in  but the three year coverage period did not begin until january earned premiums for included million attributable to kbs  the remainder were attributable to wes fic and related principally to super catastrophe business 
premiums on super catastrophe reinsurance are not recognized as earned until the earlier of a loss occurrence or policy expiration 
insurance premiums on all other forms of insurance are recognized as earned revenues by wes fic and kbs pro rata over the term of the contract 
the underwriting gain for included million contributed by kbs  after deduction of six months goodwill amortization amounting to 
million 
wes fic paid about million more to purchase kbs than the fair value of the identified net assets acquired 
this excess  or goodwill  is being amortized over years  the annual charge to underwriting gain or loss will be 
million 
the remainder of the underwriting gain was earned by wes fic on expiration of several super catastrophe policies written in the underwriting gain reported in was earned by wes fic principally upon expiration of several one year super catastrophe reinsurance contracts 
the underwriting gain reported for resulted mainly from a reduction of liabilities for losses and loss expenses with respect to certain quota share insurance business written in earlier years 
liabilities for losses and loss expenses are typically based on estimates and thus are subject to estimation error  revisions of such estimates are reflected in underwriting results of the current accounting period 
the adjustment  while not insignificant in terms of its effect on wesco s net income for the year  was not material in relation to the cumulative insurance business previously written by wes fic or in terms of its effect on wesco s net worth 
although no super catastrophe losses have been incurred to date  the managements of berkshire  wes fic and wesco believe that large super catastrophe losses will inevitably occur from time to time 
in accepting super catastrophe retrocessions  they accept the prospect of relatively volatile underwriting results for wes fic in order to obtain what they believe to be better long term results than wes fic might otherwise obtain 
one area of particular concern to the insurance industry is its exposure to claims for environmental contamination 
management of wes fic has reported that it believes wes fic has virtually no such liability 
wes fic and kbs remain liable for runoff of the losses and loss expenses under the insurance arrangements summarized in item  business 
as claims are paid over many future years  the liability for insurance business to date estimated to be million as of december  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements will decline  as will the float 
dividend and interest income has been earned by the insurance group principally on the assets approximately million at market value added to wes fic by the merger of mutual savings on january   on capital contributed by wesco  on earnings retained and reinvested  and on float 
the income tax provision of the insurance segment has fluctuated as a percentage of its pre tax income in each of the periods presented in the foregoing table 
these fluctuations have been caused by fluctuations in the relationship of substantially tax exempt components of income to total pre tax income 
insurance losses and loss expenses  and the related liabilities reflected on wesco s consolidated balance sheet  because they are based in large part upon estimates  are subject to estimation error 
revisions of such estimates in future periods could significantly affect the results of operations reported for future periods 
however  the insurance group has maintained a capital position strong enough not only to absorb adverse estimation corrections but also to enable it to accept other insurance contracts 
although additional reinsurance retrocessions from berkshire subsidiaries  or acquisitions of insurance businesses like or unlike that of kbs  or other attractive reinsurance or insurance arrangements  would be welcome  the timing and extent of any increase in insurance underwriting activity cannot presently be predicted 
industrial segment following is a summary of the normal net operating results of the industrial segment  consisting of the businesses of precision steel and its subsidiaries in thousands year ended december  revenues  principally sales and services    income before income taxes    income tax provision    normal net operating income    revenues of precision steel s businesses have been relatively stable over the past three years  although volume  in terms of pounds of steel products sold  has fluctuated somewhat 
management of precision steel attributes the fluctuations in sales volume to both changing economic conditions and competitive pressures in the industrial sector of the economy 
income before income taxes and normal net operating income of the industrial segment are dependent not only on revenues  but also on operating expenses and the cost of products sold 
the latter  as a percentage of revenues  amounted to  and for  and the cost percentage typically fluctuates slightly from year to year as a result of changes in product mix and price competition at the wholesale and retail levels 
the improvement in the figure  however  was caused mainly by a decline in the cost of materials purchased in compared to  which had increased from that of precision steel s cost of products sold percentage is very sensitive to current changes in the cost of purchasing raw materials  because it carries its inventories at the lower of last in  first out cost or market  under this method  the most recent costs are reflected in cost of goods sold 
other than identified business segments set forth below is a summary of normal net operating income for items not identified with either business segment  insurance or industrial in thousands year ended december  dividend and interest income    rental income  net  from commercial real estate    interest expense    general and administrative expenses    provision for losses on foreclosed real estate   other items  net income loss before income tax provision or benefit  income tax benefit    normal net operating income  normal net operating income other than from identified business segments includes mainly dividend and interest income from marketable securities and cash equivalents owned outside the insurance subsidiaries and rental income from owned commercial real estate  reduced by the costs associated with the development and liquidation of foreclosed real estate and delinquent loans formerly owned by mutual savings and interest and other corporate expenses plus or minus income taxes other than those associated with activities of the identified segments 
normal net operating income other than from identified business segments typically fluctuates from period to period 
the decrease in the figure for from the corresponding figure for was due primarily to a reduction in tax favored dividend income following the conversion to common stock and sale in the second quarter of of the wesco group s investment in preferred stock of champion international corporation and the redemption in the fourth quarter of that year of million of the wesco group s investment in preferred stock of salomon inc the reduction in dividend income was partially offset by the absence in of provisions for losses on foreclosed real estate  there had been a sharp decline in such provisions in from  accounting for most of s improvement in normal net income 
as of march   all of the town houses and all but one of the lots in ms property s development near santa barbara  california  have been sold or are in escrow  and the outlook for satisfactory disposition of ms property s other foreclosed real estate has improved 
thus  it now appears likely that valuation allowances provided in past years  when the real estate market was much weaker  will no longer be required 
nonsegment interest expense was much lower in than in and  mainly due to the parent company s partial repayment of borrowings from wes fic beginning in mid using proceeds from sale of its champion international corporation investment in mid and partial redemption of its salomon inc preferred stock holding late in the reduction in wesco s interest payments to wes fic reduced insurance segment revenues accordingly although wesco s consolidated net income was not affected 
wesco s nonsegment activities have been credited with an income tax benefit in recent years because of the high proportion of tax favored dividend income to total pre tax income or loss from such activities 
the decline in the tax benefit from to followed the decline in such tax favored income 
management s long term goal is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share  with little regard to earnings recorded in any given year 
there is no particular strategy as to the timing of sales of investments or the realization of securities gains 
securities may be sold for a variety of reasons  including the belief that prospects for future appreciation of a particular investment are less attractive than the prospects for reinvestment of the after tax proceeds from its sale  or the desire for funds for an acquisition or repayment of debt 
realized gains and losses on investments have been an element of wesco s net income for a number of years 
the amounts of these gains or losses  recorded when securities are sold or when a decline in market value of an investment is considered to be other than temporary  tend to fluctuate significantly from year to year 
the varying effect upon wesco s pre tax income is evident on the face of the consolidated statement of income 
the amount of realized gain or loss has no predictive value  and variations in amount from period to period have no practical analytical value  particularly in view of the existence of substantial net unrealized price appreciation in wesco s consolidated investment portfolio 
wesco s shareholders equity at december  contained million  or per share  of unrealized appreciation of investments  net of taxes about of shareholders equity  compared to at december  and at december  consolidated earnings included realized securities losses of million  after income taxes 
in wesco and its subsidiaries realized securities gains of million  after taxes  including an after tax gain of million on conversion to common stock and sale of their investment in convertible preferred stock of champion international corporation 
in  the wesco group realized net after tax gains on sales of securities of million  they also wrote down their carrying value of an investment in preferred stock of usair group  inc usair  believed to have declined in market value other than temporarily by million  after income tax effect 
see note to wesco s consolidated financial statements for further information as to investments of the wesco group 
wesco s consolidated revenues include significant amounts of tax favored dividend income from preferred and common stocks as well as substantially tax exempt interest on state and municipal bonds 
fluctuations in the proportion of these components to total consolidated pre tax income have resulted in tax provisions as percentages of pre tax income of  and in  and the exceptionally low effective rate in was caused essentially by the million writedown of the wesco group s investment in usair preferred stock  the writedown significantly reduced the proportion of pre tax income taxed at ordinary rates 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 
consolidated revenues  expenses and earnings set forth in item  selected financial data  and in wesco s consolidated statement of income  are not necessarily indicative of future revenues  expenses and earnings  in that they are subject to significant variations in amount and timing of securities gains and losses and the possible occurrence of other unusual items 
for example  the merger of mutual savings into wes fic at the beginning of increased wes fic s insurance and reinsurance capacity and asset deployment options  enabling it to enter into the business of super catastrophe reinsurance in  as explained above 
another example of a significant unusual item was wesco s expansion of its insurance segment operations through acquisition of kbs in mid in addition to exposure to large fluctuations due to realization of securities gains and losses or the occurrence of other unusual items  wesco s consolidated revenues  expenses and earnings from operations are expected to be much more volatile than they were prior to wes fic s entry into the super catastrophe reinsurance business 
shareholders equity is impacted not only to the extent the foregoing types of unusual items affect earnings  but also to reflect changes in unrealized appreciation of investments  which are not reflected in earnings
