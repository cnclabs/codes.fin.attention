the company s future depends on the growth of the cable tv market in the united states and internationally 
in the united states  a number of factors could affect the future profitability of the company  including changes in the regulatory climate for cable tv  changes in the competitive structure of the cable and telecommunications industries or changes in the technology base of the industry 
internationally  the company s profitability depends on its ability to penetrate new markets in the face of competition from other united states and foreign companies 
other impact of technological obsolescence the company s products are subject to technological obsolescence as government regulations  competition or the nature of the broadband communications industry could require changes in the current product lines 
the rapid changes in all sectors of the communications industry and the entry of new technology could significantly impact the sale of the company s products

impact of inflation and changing prices although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation  the company has experienced some increased costs of materials  supplies  salaries and benefits due to inflation 
the company attempts to pass on increased costs and expenses by increasing selling prices  when possible  and by developing more useful and economical products that can be sold at favorable profit margins 
foreign operations because a substantial portion of the company s products are purchased from vendors in taiwan  china and thailand the far east  the company is subject to price increases imposed by those vendors to compensate for currency fluctuations 
during fiscal years through the us dollar generally maintained it s purchasing power against the currencies of the countries from which the company purchases most of its products 
if the us dollar were to weaken  the company would consider setting price increases for its products 
continued weakening of the us dollar could cause the company to lose its competitive costing edge to us based manufacturers which could adversely affect operating results 
restrictive foreign government regulations or political instability could also materially affect the operating results of the company 
as discussed above  foreign economic and financial uncertainties could also materially affect sales levels to foreign customers which could materially affect the operating results of the company
