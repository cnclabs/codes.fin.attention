net loss income net sales and service revenues net sales and service revenues for fiscal were million  a decrease of million from million for fiscal the decrease is attributable to a comparable store decrease of million offset by the opening of seven new stores including three replacement stores and a full year s contribution to revenues of the five new stores including one replacement store opened in fiscal the decline in comparable store sales is attributable to the continuing soft sales environment impacting the consumer electronics industry plus the increased competition from national competitors in all our major markets 
in addition  the company announced the closing of nine stores in buffalo and rochester  new york and dayton and springfield  ohio in january the inventory at these stores was liquidated during the last two months of the year 
all major product categories contributed to the decline in sales with computers and computer accessories and color televisions reflecting the largest dollar declines

gross profit gross profit for fiscal was million  a decrease of million from the million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profit for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal the decline in gross profit percentage was attributable to the nine store closings where the inventory was sold at slightly less than cost plus a higher cost of merchandise due to the company not being able to take advantage of better discounts since the volume of purchases did not meet certain vendor criteria 
these factors combined with the increasingly competitive environment and the soft consumer electronics industry sales trend resulted in the percentage point decrease in gross profit this year versus last year 
gross profit represents total revenues less the cost of merchandise sold  the cost of parts related to service contracts retained by the company  and the fees due to third parties related to sales of third party service contracts and company contracts assumed by a third party

million was for severance costs 
in fiscal  the nine closed stores had sales of million versus million for the prior year
