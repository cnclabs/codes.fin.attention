item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of iasi s financial position and results of operations for each of the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with iasi s consolidated and combined financial statements and notes thereto included herein 
in accordance with iasi s intent to sell its environmental services operations  the results of operations related to such operations have been reflected as a discontinued operation in iasi s consolidated and combined financial statements 
see results of operations discontinued operations 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in and consist of the following year ended december  dollar change in thousands premiums earned   net investment income   net realized gains on investments   other income   total revenues    premiums earned increased approximately  on an increase of million in net written premiums in much of the increase in net written premiums was recorded in the second half of  which directly impacted iasi s earned premium 
on a gross written basis  iasi reported an increase of million in  million of which was generated through brokerages and  of which was generated through general agencies 
these increases were offset by a million decline in iasi s remedial action coverages 
iasi reported increases in net investment income of  and net realized gains on investments of million in net investment income grew on invested assets of million in iasi s million increase in net realized gains on investments from  in to million in is attributable to the gains realized on the sale of certain equity investments 
other income increased million in over and is attributable to non recurring income of million from the american sentinel settlement  higher commission income of  and smr revenues of  since its acquisition 
total expenses increased million to million in from million in such increase was attributable to the change in loss and loss adjustment expenses lae of million and other expenses of million 
while losses incurred have increased  loss development from prior years increased million and primarily relate to property losses  which were higher than normal 
in addition  iasi has experienced increases in lae to million in from million in such increases are attributable to iasi s business mix  primarily its casualty lines of business  and to the general litigation climate 
the casualty lines of business generally have higher loss adjustment costs relative to premium dollars 
another factor affecting this increase is the court ruling in the case of montrose chemical corporation v 
admiral insurance company 
the california supreme court adopted a continuous trigger of coverage in cases involving continuous and progressive third party damage claims 
insurance companies are liable for claims occurring prior to the policy period for claims which continued to progress during the course of the policy term 
the exposure to iasi does not have a residual impact on loss reserves but does have a direct effect on iasi s loss adjustment reserving practices due to a higher potential for claims handling and litigation costs 
other expenses increased million to million in from million in and primarily were affected by the initial consolidation of smr in december and other general corporate expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of other costs attributable to iasi s insurance services business improved slightly to million in from million in income from continuing operations before taxes increased million  or  to million in from million in and net income increased  to million in from million in primarily for the reasons stated above 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  total revenues increased million  or to million in from million in premiums earned increased million to million in from million in  while net premiums declined  to million in from million in the timing of earned premiums primarily accounted for the increase in total revenues 
timing differentials reflect the changing mix of products to a substantially greater concentration in the commercial lines and environmental surety businesses and a decrease in the private passenger auto physical damage and miscellaneous surety business 
commercial lines written premiums increased by million but were offset by a reduction in the automotive and miscellaneous surety business following iasi s decision to withdraw from these markets 
also contributing to the revenue increase was  in net investment income during  a increase over revenues 
total revenue in included a gain of  attributable to the american sentinel settlement 
total expenses increased million to million in from million in such increase was primarily a result of a million increase in loss and lae 
the increase in loss and lae was a direct result of increased premium revenue of million 
acquisition expenses also increased million in from as a percentage of total revenue  total expenses for and were and  respectively 
primarily for the reasons stated above  income before income taxes increased  or  to million in from million in and net income decreased  or  to million in from million in balance sheet summary the following tables set forth the key elements of iasi s balance sheet assets year ended december  in thousands total cash and invested assets    premiums receivable    other assets    total assets    liabilities year ended december  in thousands total liability for loss lae    unearned premium    other liabilities    total liabilities    capital and surplus year ended december  in thousands total shareholders equity    combined and operating ratios the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and expense ratio and is the traditional measure of underwriting performance for insurance companies 
the operating ratio is the combined ratio less the net investment income ratio net investment income to net earned premium excluding realized and unrealized capital gains and is used to measure overall company performance 
the following table reflects the loss  lae  expense  combined  net investment and operation ratios of iasi on a generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis for each of the years ended december  and year ended december  loss ratio lae ratio expense ratio combined ratio net investment ratio operating ratio expenses the expense ratio reflected in the foregoing table is the relationship of operating costs to net written premiums on a gaap basis 
the statutory ratio differs from the gaap ratio as a result of different treatment of acquisition costs 
expense ratios have been favorably impacted by reinsurance contingencies 
investments and investment income investments of iasi are restricted to certain investments permitted by ohio and utah insurance laws 
iasi s investment policy has been established by iasi s investment committee and is reviewed periodically 
iasi has retained an independent professional investment firm to manage its fixed income portion of the investment portfolio pursuant to the investment policy and strategy 
iasi accounts for its investment securities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities which was adopted by the financial accounting standards board the fasb 
fixed maturity securities that iasi has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
as iasi s fixed income securities mature  there can be no assurance that iasi will be able to reinvest in securities with comparable yields 
iasi s other fixed maturity and all equity securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at market value 
the unrealized gains and losses as a result of the valuation is reported as a separate component of shareholders equity net of appropriate deferred income taxes 
iasi has no investments classified as trading securities

iasi has established reserves that reflect its estimates of the total losses and lae it will ultimately be required to pay under insurance and reinsurance policies 
such reserves include losses that have been reported but not settled and losses that have been incurred but not reported ibnr 
loss reserves are established on an undiscounted basis after reductions for deductibles and estimates of salvage subrogation 
for reported losses  iasi establishes reserves on a case basis within the parameters of coverage provided in the related policy 
for ibnr losses  iasi estimates reserves using established actuarial methods 
case and ibnr loss reserve estimates reflect such variables as past loss experience  social trends in damage awards  changes in judicial interpretation of legal liability and policy coverages  and inflation 
iasi takes into account not only monetary increases in the cost of what is insured  but also changes in societal factors that influence jury verdicts and case law and  in turn  claim costs 
iasi s loss reserves have been certified in accordance with the requirements of the national association of insurance commissioners 
the consolidated and combined financial statements of iasi include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae of iasi s insurance operations 
reserves for unpaid losses covered by insurance policies and bonds consist of reported losses and ibnr losses 
these reserves are determined by claims personnel and the use of actuarial and statistical procedures and they represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate cost of all unpaid losses and lae through year end 
although management uses many resources to calculate reserves  a degree of uncertainty is inherent in all such estimates 
therefore  no precise method for determining ultimate losses and lae exist 
these estimates are subject to the effect of future claims settlement trends and are continually reviewed and adjusted if necessary as experience develops and new information becomes known 
any such adjustments are reflected in current operations 
activity in the liability for unpaid losses and loss expense is summarized in the following table year ended december  in thousands balance at january    less insurance recoverables    net balance at january    incurred related to current year    prior years   total incurred    paid related to current year    prior years    total paid    net balance at end of period    plus reinsurance recoverables    balance at end of period    analysis of loss and lae development year ended december  in thousands net liability for losses and loss expenses            cumulative amount of net liability paid through one year later           two years later          three years later         four years later        five years later       six years later      seven years later     eight years later    nine years later   ten years later  the retroactively reestimated net liability for loss and loss expenses as of one year later           two years later          three years later         four years later        five years later       six years later      seven years later     eight years later    nine years later   ten years later  net cumulative redundancy deficiency        gross liability end of year    reinsurance recoverable    net liability end of year    the data set forth in the table above does not reflect the adoption of sfas no 
discontinued operations iasi s results of operations related to its environmental services operations have been reflected as a discontinued operation in iasi s consolidated and combined financial statements as a result of iasi s execution of the non binding letter of intent 
see note to the consolidated and combined financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition iasi had cash and investments  excluding mortgage loans  of million  million  and million at december   and  respectively 
the million increase from to is a result of iasi s generation of proceeds from stock issuances from exercises of outstanding options and warrants and the private placement defined herein  profits and additional loss reserves on an increasing volume of liability coverages which have slower payout patterns than property coverages 
net cash provided by operations for the years ended december    and was million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts were adequate to meet all of iasi s capital expenditure  operating and acquisition costs and resulted primarily from earnings and the timing of reinsurance contingency transactions 
iasi s financing activities provided net cash for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
during  iasi realized approximately million in cash proceeds from a private placement and from stock issuances  offset in part by dividends paid to alliance holding by csc and csu prior to the merger transactions 
sources of cash iasi s principal source of revenue from its specialty insurance services operations consists of insurance and reinsurance premiums  investment income  commission and fee income  and proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities 
premiums written become premiums earned for financial statement purposes as the premium is earned incrementally over the term of each insurance policy and after deducting the amount of premium ceded to reinsurers pursuant to reinsurance treaties or agreements 
the property and liability operation of iasi generates positive cash flow from operations as a result of premiums being received in advance of the time when the claim payments are made 
the companies of the csc group are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance regulatory agencies  applicable generally to each insurance company in its state of incorporation 
such regulations limit the amount of dividends or distributions by an insurance company to its shareholders 
if insurance regulators determine that payment of a dividend or any other payment to an affiliate such as a payment under a tax allocation agreement would  because of the financial condition of the paying insurance company or otherwise  be detrimental to such insurance company s policyholders or creditors  the regulators may block payment of such dividend or such other payment to the affiliates that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval 
ohio law limits the payment of dividends to iasi 
the maximum dividend that may be paid without prior approval of the director of insurance of the state of ohio is limited to the greater of the statutory net income of the preceding calendar year or of total statutory shareholder s equity as of the prior december as a result  the maximum dividend csc may pay to iasi in without prior approval of the director of insurance of the state of ohio is approximately million 
iasi s principal source of revenue from its business outsourcing services operation is the collection of fees from professional services rendered to its clients in the areas of information technology consulting  tax return preparation and compliance  and business valuations  as well as other areas that have been previously discussed 
in may  iasi secured a million credit facility with a united states commercial bank to provide iasi with additional liquidity and working capital 
this facility provides for borrowings at the prime lending rate plus or adjusted three month libor rate plus  which would be and  respectively  at december  and will mature in up to million of the credit facility is available for the issuance of standby letters of credit 
at december  iasi had issued million in standby letters of credit and had no cash borrowing under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which  among other things  restrict the payment of dividends and require the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by all of iasi s united states based assets related to its environmental services operations 
in december  iasi issued and sold  units of iasi the units for per unit the private placement 
each unit consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock of iasi at an exercise price of per share exercisable  in whole or in part  for a three year period from the date of issuance 
the private placement resulted in net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting the placement agent fee and other estimated expenses associated with the private placement

rochon  directors of iasi  respectively  have entered into agreements to purchase an aggregate of  units  subject to stockholder approval 
on january   the issuance of such units was approved by written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock 
in accordance with rule c under the exchange act  on or about april  iasi will distribute a schedule c information statement the information statement to holders of iasi s common stock as of the date of such written consent 
the information statement will be used to notify such holders of common stock of the action by written consent approving the issuance of units to mgd holdings  the ferrill trust and weezor 
in accordance with the requirements of the exchange act  the issuance of units to mgd holdings and messrs 
ferrill and rochon will close no earlier than days following the distribution of the information statement to such holders 
upon the closing of the issuance of such units  iasi will receive an additional million in proceeds 
uses of cash and liquidity outlook operations 
iasi s capital expenditures from continuing operations totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  which included expenditures for fixed assets for normal replacement  compliance with regulations and market development 
during the year ended december   iasi funded capital expenditures from cash on hand and operating cash flow 
iasi anticipates that during  it will continue to fund expenditures from operating cash flow supplemented by borrowing under its revolving credit facility  as necessary 
management believes that iasi currently has sufficient cash and lines of credit to fund current operations and expansion thereof 
cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and primarily came as the result of differences in the purchases and sales of investments 
iasi is required to establish a reserve for unearned premiums 
iasi s principal costs and factors in determining the level of profit is the difference between premiums earned and losses  lae and agent commissions 
loss and lae reserves are estimates of what an insurer expects to pay on behalf of claimants 
iasi is required to maintain reserves for payment of estimated losses and lae for both reported claims and for ibnr claims 
although the ultimate liability incurred by iasi may be different from current reserve estimates  management believes that the reserves are adequate 
iasi believes its cash flow from operations and available financial resources provide for adequate liquidity to fund existing and anticipated capital and operational requirements as well as to fund future growth and expansion 
management is not aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities that  if implemented  could have a material impact on iasi s liquidity  capital resources and operations 
acquisitions 
iasi s strategy is to aggressively expand its specialty insurance and business outsourcing services operations through internal growth and by acquiring and integrating existing businesses 
iasi makes its decision to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations 
see business and properties business strategy 
businesses acquired to date have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  are included in the financial statements from the date of acquisition 
management believes that iasi currently has sufficient resources  including cash on hand  cash flow from operating activities  credit facilities and access to financial markets to fund current and planned operations  service any outstanding debt and make certain acquisitions 
however  substantial additional capital may be necessary to fully implement iasi s aggressive acquisition program 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on a timely basis  if at all  or that it will be available in the amounts or on terms acceptable to iasi 
stock repurchase program in april  iasi s board of directors authorized iasi to repurchase up to  shares or of common stock during as deemed appropriate by management and authorized an additional repurchase of  shares or of common stock in february repurchases were effected at prevailing market prices from time to time on the open market prior to the negotiation of the merger transactions 
the last repurchase was effected by iasi on march  and as of such date iasi had repurchased approximately  shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately  the repurchased shares have been retired and the repurchase program has been discontinued

such statements are typically punctuated by words or phrases such as anticipate  estimate  projects  management believes  iasi believes and words or phrases of similar import 
such statements are subject to certain risks  uncertainties or assumptions 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on iasi s results of operations and financial condition are i demand for iasi s services  ii iasi s ability to integrate the operations of acquired businesses  iii iasi s ability to expand into new markets  iv the consummation of iasi s disposition of its environmental services operations  v environmental liabilities to which iasi may become subject in the future which are not covered by an indemnity or insurance  vi the impact of current and future laws and governmental regulations affecting iasi s operations  vii competitive practices in the specialty insurance and bonding industries  viii competitive practices in the reinsurance markets utilized by iasi  ix judicial  legislative  and regulatory changes of law relating to risks covered by iasi or to the operations of insurance companies in general  x market fluctuations in the values or returns on assets in iasi s investment portfolios  xi pricing of iasi insurance products  and xii adverse loss development
