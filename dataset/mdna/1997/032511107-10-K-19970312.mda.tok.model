item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of this form k  including the production and reserve disclosures contained therein  the company has included a number of forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are based on the best data available at the time this report was released for printing  however  actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors including those discussed below commodity pricing and demand  exploration and operating risks  development risks  domestic governmental risks  foreign operations risks and competition 
financial results net income and revenues anadarko s net income for increased percent to million per share compared to net income of million cents per share 
revenues for were million  up percent compared to revenues of million 
the increase in revenues and net income reflects significantly higher prices for natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids ngls 
net income in included a gain of million million after income taxes on the sale of the company s indonesia interests  which was partially offset by provisions for impairments of other international properties of million million after income taxes 
anadarko s net income was million cents per share 
the results included a non cash charge of million after income taxes related to the sale of the company s canadian subsidiary 
stated without giving effect to the sale  net income was million cents per share 
revenues for were million 
the decreases in revenues and net income in compared to reflect lower prices for natural gas in and lower production volumes of crude oil in primarily due to property sales in selected financial data millions except per share amounts revenues costs and expenses interest expense net income earnings per share costs and expenses over the past three years  anadarko s expense levels have remained relatively constant due to attention and focus on cost controls  cost savings plans and application of new technology to field production operations 
in  excluding the effect of the sale of the company s indonesia interests  anadarko s costs and expenses increased six percent compared to costs and expenses in were primarily impacted by the following factors operating expenses increased million nine percent due primarily to costs associated with gas gathering operations 
administrative and general expenses were up million percent due to higher costs associated with the company s growing workforce 
the company recorded provisions for impairments of international properties of million in these impairments were offset by the gain on a sale of the company s indonesia assets of million 
the impairments reflect costs associated with the review and study of potential exploration projects in china and several other foreign countries that the company has elected not to pursue 
this compares to million of provisions for impairments of international and geothermal properties in the company s costs and expenses decreased five percent compared to  excluding the sale of the company s canadian subsidiary in there were several reasons operating expenses decreased million four percent due primarily to lower oil and gas operating expenses 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense decreased million five percent due to a two percent decrease in gas production volumes and a percent decrease in crude oil production partly due to property sales in late in addition  the dd a rate decreased four percent due to additional reserves booked during the year 
administrative and general expenses were down million three percent due to increases in overhead capitalized and amounts charged to other working interest partners 
other taxes decreased million percent due primarily to lower natural gas prices and lower production volumes  which resulted in lower production and severance taxes 
provisions for impairments of international and geothermal properties decreased million percent 
these impairments in primarily reflect costs associated with geothermal exploration projects and the review and study of potential exploration projects in several foreign countries  which the company elected not to pursue 
costs and expenses millions operating expenses administrative and general dd a other taxes gains losses and impairments related to international and geothermal properties total interest expense anadarko s gross interest expense has increased percent over the past three years due primarily to higher levels of borrowings for capital expenditures  including producing property acquisitions 
gross interest expense in was up six percent compared to primarily due to higher average borrowings in gross interest expense in increased percent compared to primarily due to higher average borrowings and interest rates in net interest expense benefited in from an option sold for an interest rate swap agreement that was not exercised by the purchaser  which reduced interest expense in by million

interest expense millions gross interest expense interest rate swap agreement capitalized interest net interest expense analysis of volumes and prices natural gas anadarko s natural gas production volumes in decreased four percent compared to production primarily due to sales of producing properties in and natural decline 
gas production volumes in were at record levels 
the company s average us wellhead gas price in was up percent from anadarko s average us wellhead gas price in had declined percent from management expects the company s natural gas production volumes in will increase due to increased levels of drilling activity in the company s core operating areas 
during  anadarko marketed more third party gas volumes than company gas production volumes 
the company marketed bcf of third party gas in compared to bcf in and bcf in the significant increase in third party sales is a key marketing strategy for the company 
the gas price weakness that began in late continued until mid december  when a surge in heating demand caused by extreme winter conditions sent gas prices significantly higher 
natural gas markets were extremely volatile in  with the company s average price fluctuating from a low of per mcf in september to a high of per mcf in december the increase in prices can be attributed to several factors temperatures in the winter of were colder than normal in the northeast and midwest heating markets  the nation s storage volumes were lower at the beginning of the heating season compared to due to heavy storage withdrawals and higher prices for natural gas in the typical injection season may october that prohibited storage volumes from reaching traditional levels  and the heating season opened with colder than normal temperatures 
this experience shows no one can predict the precise movement of us natural gas prices 
in view of this  anadarko has developed marketing strategies to help manage production and sales volumes and mitigate the effect of the price volatility that is likely to continue

anadarko s average us crude oil price for increased percent compared to crude oil prices in were up percent compared to crude oil prices have continued to be strong in the first quarter of in response to seasonal demand for heating oils 
prices for january averaged about per barrel 
generally  the company s oil production is sold on a monthly basis as it is produced 
production of oil usually is not affected by seasonal swings in demand or in market prices 
the company s ngls sales volumes in decreased two percent compared to volumes 
the ngls sales volumes were two percent higher than ngls sales 
the average price was up percent compared to the ngls average price was nine percent higher than the average price

management believes the company s excellent portfolio of exploration and development prospects should position anadarko to continue to participate in this growth 
anadarko s wholly owned marketing subsidiary anadarko energy services company aes formerly anadarko trading company is a full service marketing company offering supply assurance  competitive pricing and tailored services to its customers 
most of the company s gas production is sold through aes 
additionally  aes purchases and sells third party gas 
in  sales of third party gas exceeded sales of the company s gas production volumes 
aes sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer 
aes has expanded its marketing capabilities to move larger volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility 
included in this strategy is expanded use of leased natural gas storage facilities and various hedging strategies to better manage price risk associated with natural gas sales

crude oil and condensate currently  all of anadarko s revenues are derived from domestic production 
presently  the company s crude oil production is sold on day evergreen contracts with prices based on postings plus a premium 
initial production from the hbns field in algeria  estimated at about  barrels of oil per day bopd gross is expected in early anadarko s marketing department is currently exploring international markets for the saharan blend crude oil 
gas gathering systems and processing plants anadarko s investment in gas gathering operations allows the company to better manage its gas production  improve ultimate recovery of reserves  enhance the value of reserves and expand marketing opportunities 
the company has invested more than million to build or acquire gas gathering systems over the last five years 
anadarko owned and operated four major gas gathering systems and one gas processing plant at the end of in addition  the company owned interests in nine other gathering systems and three other processing plants at year end in march  anadarko closed on the second of two recent acquisitions from panenergy corp  formerly panhandle eastern corporation 
the purchase price of the two systems was about million 
these two gathering systems tripled the company s overall gas gathering capacity to over mmcf d and serve approximately  wells 
approximately percent of the gas flowing through these systems is from anadarko operated wells 
during  anadarko invested an additional million to lower line pressure and increase deliverability from systems in southwest kansas 
anadarko plans to invest an additional million on enhancing its gathering systems over the next several years and improve access to multiple pipeline market hubs 
anadarko remains active in the ngls business  primarily as a result of its gas gathering and processing operations 
the company generally sells ngls on a monthly basis as they are produced 
however  some ngls are held in inventory for sale at a later date 
anadarko generally markets ngls under short term contracts 
anadarko had  barrels of ngls in inventory at the end of compared to  barrels at the end of use of derivatives anadarko uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the company s exposure to changes in the market price of natural gas and crude oil  to provide methods to fix the price for natural gas independently of the physical purchase or sale and to manage interest rates 
commodity financial instruments also provide methods to meet customer pricing requirements while achieving a price structure consistent with the company s overall pricing strategy 
while commodity financial instruments are intended to reduce the company s exposure to declines in the market price of natural gas and crude oil  the commodity financial instruments may also limit anadarko s gain from increases in the market price of natural gas and crude oil 
as a result  gains and losses on commodity financial instruments are generally offset by similar changes in the realized price of natural gas and crude oil 
gains and losses are recognized in revenues for the periods to which the commodity financial instruments relate 
anadarko s commodity financial instruments currently are comprised of futures  swaps and options

reserve replacement drilling activity is not the best measure of success for an exploration and production company 
anadarko focuses on growth and profitability 
reserve replacement is the key to growth and future profitability depends on the cost of finding oil and gas reserves 
the company believes its performance in both areas is excellent 
for the th consecutive year  anadarko more than replaced annual production volumes with proved reserves of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls  stated on an energy equivalent barrel eeb basis 
during  anadarko s worldwide reserve replacement was percent of total production  which was million energy equivalent barrels mmeebs 
the company s worldwide reserve replacement in was percent of total production and in was percent of total production 
over the last five years  the company s annual reserve replacement has averaged percent of annual production volumes 
in  the company replaced percent of its production volumes with us reserves 
the company s us reserve replacement for the five year period was percent of anadarko s us production 
by comparison  the most recent published us industry average was percent 
source department of energy 
anadarko s us reserve replacement performance for the same period was percent of production 
industry data for are not yet available 
cost of finding for  anadarko s worldwide finding cost for proved reserves was per eeb compared to per eeb in and to per eeb in the company s low worldwide finding costs are due to the success of the company s exploration programs 
anadarko s us finding cost for was per eeb compared to per eeb in and per eeb in cost of finding results in any one year can be misleading due to the long lead times associated with exploration and development 
a better measure of cost of finding performance is over a five year period 
anadarko has consistently outperformed the industry in average finding costs 
for the period  anadarko s us cost of finding was per eeb 
anadarko s worldwide finding cost for the same five year period was per eeb 
industry data for are not yet available 
for comparison purposes  the most recent published five year average for the industry shows us average cost of finding was per eeb and worldwide cost of finding was per eeb 
source arthur andersen  sc for the same period  anadarko s us finding cost was per eeb and worldwide finding cost was per eeb 
proved reserves at the end of  anadarko s proved reserves were mmeebs compared to mmeebs at year end and mmeebs at year end reserves increased by percent in compared to  primarily due to exploration and development drilling and improved recovery 
anadarko s proved reserves have grown by percent over the past three years  primarily as a result of successful exploration projects in algeria  the gulf of mexico and alaska  as well as successful exploitation and development drilling programs in major domestic fields in core areas onshore and offshore 
the company s proved natural gas reserves at year end were trillion cubic feet tcf compared to tcf at year end and tcf at year end anadarko s crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves at year end increased percent to mmbbls compared to mmbbls at year end this compares to reserves of mmbbls at year end crude oil reserves have increased percent over the last three years due to large discoveries in algeria  the gulf of mexico and alaska 
crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves now comprise percent of the company s proved reserves compared to about percent at year end and about percent at year end creating balance between crude oil reserves and natural gas reserves was a key strategy for the company 
the company emphasizes that the volumes of reserves are estimates which  by their nature  are subject to revision 
the estimates are made using all available geologic and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional performance data 
at december   the present value discounted at percent of future net revenues from anadarko s proved reserves was billion  before income taxes  and was billion  after income taxes  stated in accordance with the regulations of the securities and exchange commission and financial accounting standards board 
the estimated present value of future net revenues  after income taxes  increased percent compared to primarily due to increases in commodity prices for oil and gas at year end and the additions of proved reserves related to successful drilling worldwide 
see supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities in the consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
the present value of future net revenues does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of anadarko s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
acquisitions and divestitures several years ago  the company embarked on an asset management program to sell non core properties and invest the proceeds into core operating areas around the world in order to focus financial resources and personnel on the company s core areas of operation 
over the past three years  the company has sold properties  either as a strategic exit or by asset rationalization in existing core areas  with proceeds totaling million 
reserves associated with these sales and trades are mmeebs  resulting in unit proceeds of per eeb 
during the same time period  anadarko has acquired through purchases and trades mmeebs of proved reserves at a cash cost of million  or per eeb 
during  anadarko sold reserves of mmeebs  of which mmeebs were attributed to the company s interests in indonesia 
total proceeds from divestitures in amounted to million or per eeb 
in  acquisitions of producing properties totaled million and mmeebs  at a cost of per eeb 
the largest acquisition was a package of properties in the oklahoma panhandle portion of the hugoton embayment 
this package includes significant undeveloped acreage on which anadarko plans to conduct a d seismic survey and drill wells in total proceeds from divestitures were million  which included assets in north texas and the permian basin of southeast new mexico and west texas 
reserves sold equaled mmeebs  resulting in unit proceeds of per eeb 
the largest sale in was the company s interest in non strategic fields to other operators for million 
in  anadarko acquired mmeebs of reserves at a cost of million  or per eeb 
the largest acquisition was a package of properties in west texas purchased from shell western e p 
the company also purchased for million a water supply system in west texas which reduced operating costs and enabled expansions of several important waterflood projects 
during  anadarko sold assets in the arkoma basin  the rocky mountains and all of the company s canadian holdings 
reserves associated with the sales and trades were mmeebs  with proceeds of about million  or per eeb

these laws and regulations govern  among other things  the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment  the issuance of permits in connection with drilling and production activities  the discharge and disposition of waste materials  offshore oil and gas operations  the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites 
in addition  these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for the company s failure to comply with them or for any contamination resulting from the company s operations 
anadarko takes the issue of environmental stewardship very seriously and works diligently to comply with applicable environmental rules and regulations 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition in the past 
however  because environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent  there can be no assurances that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
for a description of certain environmental proceedings in which the company is involved  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
other regulatory agencies in certain states have authority to issue permits for the drilling of wells  regulate the spacing of wells  prevent the waste of oil and gas resources through proration and regulate environmental matters 
operations conducted by the company on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions  including various nondiscrimination statutes 
additionally  certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the bureau of land management and the minerals management service of the department of interior and  with regard to certain federal leases  with prior approval of drill site locations by the environmental protection agency 
in addition to the standard permit process  federal leases may require a complete environmental impact assessment prior to authorizing an exploration or development plan 
additional factors affecting business commodity pricing and demand crude oil prices continue to be affected by political developments worldwide  pricing decisions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and the volatile trading patterns in the commodity futures markets 
natural gas prices also continue to be highly volatile 
in periods of sharply lower commodity prices  the company may curtail capital spending projects and delay or defer drilling wells in certain areas because of lower cash flows 
changes in crude oil and natural gas prices can impact the company s determination of proved reserves and the company s calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas reserves 
in addition  demand in the united states and worldwide may affect the company s level of production 
exploration and operating risks the company s business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and gas  including blowouts  cratering and fire  each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property and injury to persons 
as protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards  the company maintains insurance coverage  including certain physical damage  employer s liability  comprehensive general liability and workmen s compensation insurance 
although anadarko is not fully insured against all risks in its business  the company believes that the coverage it maintains is customary for companies engaged in similar operations 
the occurrence of a significant event against which the company is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
development risks the company is increasingly involved in large development projects in the gulf of mexico  alaska and internationally 
key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include project approvals by joint venture partners  timely issuance of permits and licenses by host country governmental agencies  manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment  and commercial arrange ments for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons 
in large development projects  these uncertainties are usually resolved  but delays and differences between estimated timing and actual timing of critical events are commonplace and may  therefore  affect the forward looking statements related to large development projects 
domestic governmental risks the domestic operations of the company have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and by federal  state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production  changes in taxes  royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies  price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection regulations 
foreign operations risk the company s operations in areas outside the united states are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  war  insurrection and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the company s international operations 
the company s international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and taxation 
to date  the company s international operations have not been materially affected by these risks 
competition the oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves  as well as  in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production 
the company s competitors include the major oil companies  independent oil and gas concerns  individual producers  gas marketers and major pipeline companies  as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
competition for drilling rigs is keen in certain areas of the gulf of mexico 
during and  the company experienced increases in drilling rig rental rates due to the tight rig market in the gulf of mexico 
capital expenditures  liquidity and long term debt capital expenditures anadarko s total capital spending in was million  an increase of percent over a capital spending level of million and about equal to spending of million 
capital spending in did not reach the budget initially set at million  largely due to construction delays in algeria 
the spending level was lower than originally anticipated due to lower gas prices and deferred drilling opportunities in the gulf of mexico s sub salt play 
the spending included million to acquire offshore lease blocks in the gulf of mexico at the minerals management service offshore lease sale no 
in march the largest categories of capital spending in  and were for exploration and development activities in the us and overseas 
the company funded its capital investment program in  and primarily through cash flow  plus proceeds from property sales and increases in long term debt 
capital expenditures millions exploration development acquisitions of producing properties gathering and other interest and overhead total capital spending for has been set at about million  an increase of percent over and the highest anticipated spending level in company history 
the higher capital budget is driven by increased opportunities in both us and international exploration and development drilling programs 
the budget includes million for exploration  million for development  million for gathering and other  and million for capitalized interest and overhead 
although no dollars are budgeted for acquisitions in  the company will look at opportunities and  depending on conditions of the market  may elect to purchase properties 
historically  the company has based capital spending on anticipated cash flows including proceeds from divestitures  but certain portions of the capital spending budget such as acquisitions have been financed from time to time 
in addition  the company s budget is adjusted periodically to reflect changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
the company believes cash flows  including proceeds from divestitures  and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet capital and operating requirements  including any contingencies  during liquidity and long term debt at year end  anadarko s total debt was million 
this compares to year end total debt of million 
in january  the company entered into a sale lease back agreement for million involving natural gas compressors in anadarko s major mid continent gathering systems 
the transaction monetized company assets and took advantage of current low interest rates 
proceeds from the transaction were used for general corporate purposes 
during  anadarko offered two century bonds 
in september  the company issued million principal amount of debentures due each debenture holder has the one time right to have the company purchase on september   all or a portion of  the debentures  at a purchase price equal to par plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in november  the company issued million principal amount of debentures due november  during the fourth quarter of  anadarko entered into a year swap agreement with a notional value of million whereby the company receives a fixed interest rate and pays a floating interest rate indexed to month libor 
this agreement was entered into to offset a portion of the effect of the company s fixed rate long term debt financed in in march  anadarko issued million principal amount of debentures due each debenture holder has the one time right to have the company purchase on march   all or a portion of  the debenture at a purchase price equal to par plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in may  anadarko entered into a million revolving credit agreement and a million day credit agreement with a group of commercial banks 
as of december  and  there were no outstanding borrowings under these agreements 
in may  the company issued one million shares of common stock to the anadarko petroleum corporation executives and directors benefits trust trust to secure present and future unfunded benefit obligations of the company 
the shares issued to the trust are not considered outstanding for quorum or voting calculations  but the trust will receive dividends 
the shares are included in the calculation of earnings per share under the treasury stock method and have no dilutive effect 
anadarko s net cash from operating activities in was up percent to million compared to million in net cash from operating activities in was million
