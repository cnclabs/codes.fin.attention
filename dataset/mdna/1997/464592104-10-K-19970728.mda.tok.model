competition general competition in the gaming industry is intense in the markets where the company operates gaming facilities 
as new gaming opportunities arise in existing gaming jurisdictions  in new gaming jurisdictions and on indian owned lands  new or expanded operations by others can be expected to increase competition for the company s existing and future operations and could limit new opportunities for the company or result in the saturation of certain gaming markets 
casino gaming does not have a long operating history in the jurisdictions where the company operates gaming facilities and  therefore  the effects of competition in these jurisdictions cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
many of the company s competitors have more gaming industry experience  are larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
as a result  increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  management believes that large  well financed gaming facility operators have become attracted to biloxi  and may take interest in other of the company s markets as well 
bossier city operations the isle bossier city is one of four comparably sized gaming facilities currently licensed and operating in the shreveport bossier city market  each of which has comparable amenities 
the isle bossier city will face increased competition from existing competitors to the extent that they add to or enhance existing amenities 
in that regard  binion s horseshoe casino is currently constructing a room all suites hotel at its dockside riverboat casino location in bossier city  and a larger riverboat 
in addition to existing competition  the granting of additional gaming licenses in the shreveport bossier city market or the relocation of existing licenses to that market from elsewhere in the state of louisiana would increase competition for the isle bossier city 
in that regard  hilton recently received approval to relocate its riverboat from new orleans to shreveport to operate as part of a joint venture with harrah s 
in addition  a joint venture involving hollywood casinos was awarded the last available license to develop a casino in bossier city 
although the louisiana gaming control board subsequently re opened the application period with respect to the hollywood casinos license  management believes that the license will likely be awarded to an operator in the shreveport bossier city market 
therefore  it is likely  in management s opinion  that up to six dockside riverboat casinos eventually will be operating in the shreveport bossier city market  where only four currently operate 
in addition  legislation was passed during the legislative session which permits up to  square feet of slot machines to operate at louisiana downs  a thoroughbred racing facility located approximately miles east of the isle bossier city 
prior to commencing operation of slot machines at the facility  voter approval in a parish wide election is required  and the louisiana legislature must pass legislation during a fiscal session assessing a tax on the slot operations 
however  if ultimately approved  such operations may have an adverse effect on the isle bossier city 
moreover  the legalization of casino gaming in texas could have a material adverse effect on the isle bossier city 
lake charles operations the isle lake charles is one of two riverboat gaming facilities operating in the lake charles  louisiana market 
the isle lake charles riverboat competitor  players international  operates two riverboats and a room hotel facility from a single location in the city of lake charles approximately two miles from the site of the isle lake charles 
in addition  a land based  indian owned casino with approximately  square feet of gaming space is operating in kinder  louisiana  approximately miles to the northeast of the isle lake charles 
riverboats in the lake charles market are subject to cruising requirements  which makes a land based casino more desirable to many gaming customers 
players international and the company each hold two gaming licenses and operate two riverboats from a single facility 
louisiana  unlike certain other jurisdictions  does not permit license holders to operate a second boat out of the same location without a gaming license for each boat 
in addition to existing competition  the granting of additional gaming licenses in the lake charles market or the relocation of existing licenses from elsewhere in the state of louisiana to that market would increase competition for the isle lake charles 
in addition  legislation was passed during the legislative session which permits up to  square feet of slot machines to operate at delta downs  a quarterhorse racing facility located approximately miles west of the isle lake charles 
prior to commencing operation of slot machines at the facility  voter approval in a parish wide election is required  and the louisiana legislature must pass legislation during a fiscal session assessing a tax on the slot operations 
however  if ultimately approved  such operations may have an adverse effect on the isle lake charles 
moreover  the legalization of casino gaming in texas would have a material adverse effect on the isle lake charles 
biloxi operations eleven gaming facilities including the isle biloxi  with an aggregate of approximately  square feet of casino floor space  are located along the mississippi gulf coast 
eight facilities are located in biloxi and collectively account for approximately  square feet of casino floor space 
two of the other three facilities are located in gulfport  approximately miles from biloxi  and the other is located in bay st 
louis approximately miles from biloxi 
because mississippi law does not limit the number of gaming licenses that may be granted  there may be increases in the number of gaming facilities along the mississippi gulf coast and the surrounding areas  which could have a material adverse effect on the isle biloxi 
in addition  the company believes that many of its competitors will add to or enhance their existing amenities and new competitors will enter the mississippi gulf coast market 
mirage resorts  inc is currently developing  and has received a gaming license to open  a casino and resort in biloxi  at a site approximately two miles from the isle biloxi 
the project  which the company believes will include an  room hotel  is scheduled to open in late in addition  an imperial palace casino and hotel is currently being built and will be located on the back bay in biloxi  approximately three miles from the isle biloxi

similarly  grand casinos is currently constructing a second room hotel at its site in biloxi  and casino magic is constructing a room hotel at its location immediately adjacent to the isle biloxi 
furthermore  two gaming companies are seeking the necessary approvals to develop casinos adjacent to interstate  which if developed  could have an adverse affect on the isle biloxi s operation 
certain existing and future competitors have more extensive financial resources than does the company 
intense competition on the mississippi gulf coast has contributed to the closure of three gaming facilities in that area and one other is operating under bankruptcy protection 
in addition  the legalization of casino gaming in alabama would increase competition for  and would have a material adverse effect on  the isle biloxi 
vicksburg operations the isle vicksburg is one of four gaming facilities currently operating an aggregate of approximately  square feet of casino floor space in the vicksburg area 
the isle vicksburg is the second largest casino in the vicksburg area

because mississippi does not limit the number of gaming licenses that may be granted  there may be increases in the number of gaming facilities in vicksburg and elsewhere in counties bordering the mississippi river  which could have a material adverse effect on the isle vicksburg 
there have been recent reports that horseshoe gaming is considering the development of a casino and hotel in vicksburg on property currently owned by lady luck gaming 
while the mississippi statutes specify that gaming may only be held on the mississippi river and on navigable waters within counties bordering the mississippi river  several controversies have arisen concerning the exact permissible locations of casinos within this statutory language 
specifically  there have been several attempts to expand gaming as far east of the mississippi river as possible 
it is likely that these controversies and efforts to expand gaming east of the mississippi river will continue 
there is currently an action pending in a mississippi state court involving an appeal of a decision by the mississippi gaming commission denying site approval in connection with a proposed casino development by horseshoe gaming in the eastern part of warren county  the county in which the isle vicksburg is located  between the isle vicksburg and its primary market of jackson  mississippi 
in the event sites are approved in the eastern part of warren county  the isle vicksburg would be adversely affected

proposals to amend or supplement louisiana s riverboat gaming statute are frequently introduced in the louisiana state legislature 
no assurance can be given that changes in louisiana gaming law will not occur or that such changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business in louisiana 
florida on june   the florida department of business and professional regulation  acting through its division of pari mutuel wagering the division  issued its final order the order approving ppi  inc ppi  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  as a pari mutuel wagering permit holder with respect to harness and quarter horse racing at pompano park 
pursuant to the order and the relevant provisions of chapter of the florida statutes and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder the florida statute  ppi also was granted a license to conduct harness racing at pompano park for the racing season commencing july  and ending june  on a total of evening racing dates 
the division has approved ppi s license to conduct a total of live evening racing performances for the season beginning july  to june  ppi intends to seek approval to increase the number of live evening races 
although ppi does not presently intend to conduct quarter horse racing operations at pompano park  it may do so in the future  subject to division approval 
the transfer of or more of stock of a pari mutuel racing permit holder such as ppi would require the prior approval of the division 
the florida statute establishes minimum purse requirements for breeders and owners  license fees and the tax structure on pari mutuel permit holders 
the division may revoke or suspend any permit or license upon the willful violation by the permit holder or licensee of any provision of the florida statute 
in lieu of suspending or revoking a permit or license  the division may impose various civil penalties against the permit holder or licensee 
penalties so imposed may not exceed  for each count or separate offense 
pursuant to division order and recent enactments to the florida statute  ppi is also authorized to conduct full card pari mutuel wagering at pompano park on simulcast harness races from outside florida throughout the racing season and on night thoroughbred races within florida if the thoroughbred permitholder has decided to simulcast night races 
pompano park has been granted the exclusive right in florida to conduct full card simulcasting of harness racing on days in which no live racing is held at pompano park  although  on such days  pompano park must offer to rebroadcast its simulcast signals to other pari mutuel facilities other than thoroughbred parks 
in addition  pompano park may transmit its live races into any dog racing or jai alai facility throughout florida  including dade and broward counties  for intertrack wagering 
the florida statute establishes the percentage split between pompano park and the other facilities receiving such signals 
recent legislation in florida provided certain reductions in applicable tax and license fees related to intertrack wagering on broadcasts of simulcast harness racing and thoroughbred racing 
the company believes that simulcast rights at pompano park and the recent changes in the florida statute are important to the results of operations of ppi 
effective january   the florida statute permits pari mutuel facilities to be licensed by the division to operate card rooms in those counties in which a majority vote of the county commission has been obtained and a local ordinance has been adopted 
card rooms can only be operated at pari mutuel facilities on days that the facility is running live races 
the hours of operation extend from two hours before the post time of the first live race and continue until two hours after the conclusion of the last live race at the racing facility 
thoroughbred racing facilities must choose between operating card rooms or simulcasting night races from outside the state  but cannot do both and if electing to simulcast night races  they will be required to retransmit the night simulcast signal to certain other pari mutuel facilities  including pompano park 
the card room operator is the house and will deal the cards

the division is currently promulgating rules to give effect to the foregoing provisions of the florida statute 
texas and alabama legalization potential casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions adjacent to louisiana and mississippi 
as a result  residents of these jurisdictions  principally texas and alabama  comprise a significant portion of the customers of the isle bossier city and the isle biloxi  respectively 
it is anticipated that residents of texas will comprise a significant portion of the customers of the isle lake charles 
although casino gaming is not currently permitted in texas and the texas attorney general has issued an opinion that gaming in texas would require an amendment to the texas constitution  the texas legislature has considered various proposals to authorize casino gaming 
no gaming legislation was enacted in the most recent legislative session ended may  if the texas legislature which meets every two years in odd numbered years does not enact legislation to amend the texas constitution in a special session  the next opportunity for the enactment of such legislation would be in although special sessions may be called by the texas governor for matters that were pending in the preceding regular legislative session  texas governor george bush has publicly opposed the legalization of gaming in texas 
a constitutional amendment would require a two thirds vote of those present and voting in each house of the texas legislature and approval by the electorate in a referendum 
the legalization of casino gaming in texas at or near the primary market areas of the isle bossier city or the isle lake charles  including the dallas ft 
worth and houston areas  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
casino gaming is currently illegal in alabama due to a constitutional prohibition against lotteries 
several attempts have been made to pass a resolution of the alabama legislature providing for a statewide referendum on the repeal of the pertinent section of the alabama constitution prohibiting lotteries 
this action would require a three fifths vote of each house of the legislature  followed by a statewide referendum 
both the governor and the attorney general of alabama have stated their opposition to legalized casino gaming  even though pari mutuel wagering and limited charitable bingo exist within the state 
the legalization of casino gaming in alabama would have a material adverse effect on the isle biloxi  both because the mobile metropolitan area is a major market for the isle biloxi and because a substantial portion of the isle biloxi s customers are residents of areas east of mobile  including florida and georgia  and pass though the mobile area when traveling to biloxi
