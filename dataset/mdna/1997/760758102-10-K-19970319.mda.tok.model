net income for the year ended december  increased to million  excluding the one time fdic saif assessment  from million for the year ended december  the increase in net income is due to a million increase in net interest income  a  increase in non interest income offset by increases of million in operating expenses   in provision for loan losses and  in income taxes 
net income per common share was 
on a primary and fully diluted basis  excluding the one time fdic saif assessment  for the year ended december  compared to 
on a primary basis and 
on a fully diluted basis for the year ended december  earnings per share decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to a million increase in the average shares outstanding during primarily as a result of the november secondary equity offering and the conversion of the company s series a preferred stock to common stock see note to the consolidated financial statements 
reported net income per share for the year ended december  was 
the one time fdic saif assessment resulted in a reduction of eps of 
the company s net income for the nine months ended december  was  compared with net income of  for the nine months ended december  net income per common share was 
on a primary basis and 
on a fully diluted basis for the nine months ended december  compared to 
per common share on both primary and fully diluted basis for the nine months ended december  the increase in net income for the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  is primarily due to increases of approximately million in net interest income and million in non interest income offset by increases of approximately million in non interest expense and  in income tax expense 
the company s net income decreased by  from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  earnings per share declined to in from in before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
net income for the year ended march  included a  
per share cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
the decrease in earnings for of  excluding the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  is primarily due to increases of million in net interest income and million in other non interest income and service charges on deposit accounts which were more than offset by a decrease of million in gain on sale of loans and servicing and mortgage trading income  a  loss on trading account investments  and an increase of million in operating expenses 
the primary component of earnings for most financial institutions including the company is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income received on its interest earning assets and the interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is determined primarily by interest rate spread and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income net interest income increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income is primarily due to an increase of million in average net interest earning assets as a result of a million increase in average interest earning assets offset by an increase of million in average interest bearing liabilities 
average loans outstanding increased million and average investments and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions increased million while average interest bearing deposits increased million and average borrowed money outstanding decreased million 
the increases in the loan and deposit portfolios are primarily due to the banyan bank acquisition 
in addition  an increase of basis points in the bank s net interest spread contributed  to the increase in net interest income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net interest spread increased due to a basis point increase in the yield on interest earning assets and a basis point decrease in the rate on interest bearing liabilities which is a result of the bank s efforts to change the compositions of the loan and deposit portfolios to that of a traditional commercial bank 
net interest income for the nine months ended december  increased million or from the nine months ended december  due primarily to an increase of million in interest income on loans  offset by an increase of million in interest expense on certificates of deposit 
the average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities increased during the nine months ended december  compared with the nine months ended december  primarily due to the acquisition of governors bank 
in addition the bank s net interest margin increased to for the nine months ended december  from for the nine months ended december   primarily as a result of a change in the composition of the bank s loan portfolio 
the composition of the bank s loan portfolio changed as a result of the governors merger to reflect an increase in consumer  commercial business and commercial real estate loans which generally are higher yielding than residential mortgage loans 
net interest income increased by to million for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans of million as a result of an increase in loan volume during  partially offset by an increase in interest expenses of million due to an increase in the rate and volume of interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in loan volume for the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  is attributable to an increase in commercial and consumer loan originations as well as the governors acquisition on november  interest income the increase of million in interest income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is due to an increase of million in interest and fees on loans  a  increase in interest on interest bearing deposits and a  increase in interest and dividends on investments 
the increase in interest and fees on loans is primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of loans outstanding during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in loans outstanding is primarily a result of the banyan bank acquisition 
interest income increased approximately million for the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  the primary contributor to the increase in interest income is a million increase in the average loan balances outstanding for the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  which resulted in an increase in interest income of million 
approximately million of the increase in interest income for the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  resulted from an increase in the average rate earned on loans 
the average investment balance increased approximately million as a result of the governors acquisition which was the primary reason for the increase in interest income on investments of  for the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  the increases in loan volume and loan portfolio yield are the result of increased consumer and commercial loans due to the acquisition of governors as well as an increase in these types of loan originations 
thirty six percent of the bank s loan portfolio is comprised of consumer  commercial  and commercial real estate loans at december  of the million increase in interest income for the year ending march  compared to the year ending march   million was attributable to an increase in interest earning asset volume  and the remainder was due to an increase in average yield 
the average yield on interest earning assets increased from in to in primarily as a result of a larger portion of interest earnings assets representing loans rather than lower yielding investments 
interest expense the increase in interest expense of  is due to an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities  which was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of  due to a decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities of basis points for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily a result of reducing the rate paid on certificate of deposits by approximately basis points 
the bank began lowering interest rates paid on certificates of deposits in march to become aligned with the commercial bank market 
likewise  the average balance of non interest bearing deposits increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in line with management s goals  the average balance of non interest bearing deposits increased million to for the nine months ended december  from million for the nine months ended december  however  increases in the volume of certificates of deposits and the average rate paid on certificates of deposits contributed to the million increase in interest expense for the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  an increase of million in the average balance of certificates of deposits resulted in an increase of million in interest expense while an increase in the rate paid on certificates of deposits increased interest expense million for the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  the governors acquisition resulted in an increase in average certificate of deposits of approximately million 
of the million increase in interest expense for the year ended march   million was a result of increased average volume of interest bearing liabilities to million in from million in and  was due to an increase in the average rate on interest bearing liabilities to in from in the primary contributor to these rates and volume increases was certificates of deposit

the following table sets forth certain information regarding changes in net interest income due to changes in the average balance of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and due to changes in average rates for the periods indicated 
for purposes of this table  rate volume changes have been allocated solely to rate changes and non accrual loans are included in average balances

the amount of future provisions is a function of the ongoing evaluation of the allowance for loan losses which considers the characteristics of the loan portfolio  economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
the provision for loan losses increased  or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans is approximately 
which management believes to be adequate considering the bank s loan composition at december  and the bank s historical losses 
management s evaluation of the allowance for loan losses includes applying relevant risk factors to the entire loan portfolio including non performing loans 
risk factors applied to the performing loan portfolio are based  in part  on the bank s past year loss history and considers the current portfolio s characteristics  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
non performing loans are carried at fair value based on the most recent information available 
the amount of provision for loan losses is a function of management s evaluation of the allowance for loan losses 
based on the analysis of the allowance for loan losses at december   management believes the allowance is adequate 
in accordance with the bank s asset classification policy  non performing loans loans contractually past due days or more are recorded at the lesser of the loan balance or estimated fair value of the collateral underlying the loan for collateral dependent loans  or the net present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate 
as a result  any expected losses from loans identified at december  as non performing have been recognized by the bank and should not have a future impact on the allowance for loan losses unless the condition of the loan further deteriorates 
at december  the bank had million in non performing loans representing of total loans compared to million representing of total loans at december  the increase in non performing loans is due partially to an increase in residential mortgage loan delinquencies and in part to a  commercial loan 
the provision for loan losses decreased  for the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  however  the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans remained relatively stable at at december  compared to at december  in addition  the amount of non performing loans has decreased approximately  at december  compared to december  although the percent of non performing loans to total loans increased from 
at march  to at march   the provision for loan losses remained relatively stable for the periods 
the increase in non performing loans was primarily a result of the governor s loan portfolio acquired 
likewise an allowance for loan losses was acquired 
non interest income non interest income increased  or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposit accounts  an increase in the gain on sale of loans and an increase in the gain on sale of investments available for sale offset by a decrease in mortgage trading income 
non interest income increased approximately to million for the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  primarily as a result of increases in service charges on deposit accounts and other income 
in addition  the nine months ended december  included a  loss on the sale of trading investments 
non interest income significantly decreased from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  due to the reduction in mortgage banking activities which resulted in a decrease in the amount of gain on the sale of loans and servicing 
service charges on deposit accounts in line with the bank s goal to increase service fee income on deposit accounts  service charges on deposit accounts increased approximately to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  average transaction account balances increased approximately million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to an increase in the volume of transaction accounts 
in addition  the composition of the bank s deposit portfolio has continued to change to reflect an increase in commercial customers which typically require services that generate more fee income than the personal deposit accounts 
service charges on deposit accounts more than doubled for the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  the increase in service charges on deposit accounts is due to an increase in the average number of transaction accounts serviced during the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  as well as an overall increase in fee charges 
average transaction account balances increased approximately million for the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  in addition  the composition of the bank s deposit portfolio has changed to reflect an increase in commercial customers which typically require services that generate more fee income than the personal deposit accounts 
service charges on deposit accounts increased for the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  primarily as a result of average transaction accounts increasing from million to million 
the increase in the number of commercial accounts was due to the acquisition of governors as well as the bank s initiatives to attract transaction type deposit accounts 
gain on sales of loans and servicing rights gain on sale of loans and servicing increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in the gains realized on the sale of loans as the volume of loan sales in both years was relatively stable 
the gain realized on the sale of loans is dependent on market interest rates relative to the loans interest rates at the time of sale and whether loans are sold servicing released or servicing retained 
no purchased loan servicing rights were sold in the years ended december  and gain on the sale of loans increased  for the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  primarily due to an increase in the amount of gain realized on the sale of loans as a result of a decrease in market interest rates during the nine months ended december  gain on the sale of servicing decreased  as no loan servicing rights were sold during the nine months ended december  due to a decrease in loan production volume  gain on sales of loans and servicing rights decreased million for the year ended march  to  compared to million for the year ended march  the decrease in mortgage banking activities is attributable to the increase in interest rates which decreased the volume of loan originations and refinancings and an intensely competitive residential construction loan market 
loan originations and loan purchases related to mortgage banking activities decreased million or in compared to loan sales decreased during the year ended march  these decreases are attributable to the decline in loan refinancing 
similar declines were experienced in the mortgage banking industry as a whole 
in addition  during  the bank reduced it s mortgage banking operations to a level where income from mortgage banking activities is less significant to the overall earnings of the bank than in prior years while increasing non interest income from core banking operations 
mortgage trading income the bank s loan trading department brokers loan packages for a fee and also acts as a principal in buying and reselling the same loan packages for a gain 
mortgage trading income decreased  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as there was no mortgage trading income recorded in mortgage trading income was stable for the nine months ended december  and mortgage trading income decreased  for the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  primarily due to an overall decrease in loan activity 
other income other income consists of loan servicing income net of the amortization of loan servicing rights  loan fees  rental income  atm fees and other miscellaneous fee income 
other income increased  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due primarily to a  increase in other fee income related to loan accounts and other services 
the increase in other fee income associated with loans is primarily due to an increase in the volume of commercial and consumer loan production 
the increase in fees for other services is a result of increased usage in new services such as pc banking and merchant deposits 
other income increased  for the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  primarily due to increases in loan late fees and other loan fees of approximately  and net loan servicing income of  loan fees increased primarily as a result of an increase in volume 
net loan servicing income increased due to an increase in loan servicing income  as a result of an increase in the average loan servicing portfolio  and a decrease in the amortization of loan servicing rights due to a decrease in loan prepayment speeds 
other fee income increased due to an overall increase in loan and deposit account volumes as well as new services offered during the nine months ended december  particularly to better serve commercial services 
other income increased  for the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  primarily due to an increase in net loan servicing income 
net loan servicing income increased  for the year ended march  to  compared to a loss of  for the year ended march  loan servicing income for the year ended march  remained relatively flat in comparison to the year ended march  while the amortization of loan servicing rights decreased from million in to  in due to the decrease in loan prepayments which resulted primarily from a rise in interest rates 
the bank purchased million of loan servicing rights in the year ended march  the decrease in amortization of loan servicing rights in the year ended march  is due to a decrease in loan prepayment speeds 
while there are many factors that affect prepayment rates on loans  prevailing loan origination rates are the primary factor 
loan prepayments generally will increase when interest rates decrease and vice versa 
operating expenses operating expenses  excluding the one time fdic saif assessment of million  pretax  increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  data processing charges and goodwill amortization 
employee compensation and benefits increased approximately million primarily due to an increase in the number of employees associated with a larger banking center network and  of non recurring costs associated with the absorption of the banyan bank acquisition 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to the increase of two branches associated with the banyan bank acquisition  a new branch which opened in june and the increased depreciation expense associated with the million increase in furniture and equipment 
approximately  of computer equipment and software were purchased during for the edp conversion and system upgrade 
data processing expenses increased  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in the volume of deposit and loan accounts processed as well as an increase in the monthly data service bureau charge since august in addition  an  non recurring expense was incurred associated with the conversion of data service bureaus 
goodwill amortization increased approximately  due to the increase in goodwill of approximately million associated with the banyan bank acquisition 
operating expenses increased million for the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  as a result of increases in employee compensation  occupancy and equipment expenses  data processing expenses  professional fees and other operating expenses which includes the amortization of goodwill 
increases in compensation  occupancy and equipment and data processing expenses are a result of the acquisition of governors and the bank s overall growth which resulted in an increase of three branches and additional departments as well as an increase in the volume of loan and deposit transactions 
other operating expenses increased  as a result of goodwill amortization associated with the governors acquisition 
additional increases in other operating expenses are a result of the bank s growth 
professional fees increased  primarily as a result of legal fees associated with corporate matters and problem loans 
overall  operating expenses as a percent of average assets slightly decreased to for the nine months ended december  compared to for the nine months ended december  operating expenses increased from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  the increase is primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment  and data processing 
these increases are a result of the bank s growth in and employee severance costs associated with reducing staffing levels in the mortgage banking operations 
growth in included expansion of the banking center network from five branches in to seven branches in and the addition of item processing and proof of deposit departments as well as growth in the commercial consumer loan and loan servicing departments 
other causes of the increase are higher volumes of deposit transaction accounts and additional expenses associated with operations acquired as a result of the merger 
income taxes income tax expense increased  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to an increase in net income before taxes and a increase in the effective tax rate to in the effective tax rate increased due to an increase in the amortization of goodwill which results in permanent tax differences 
income tax expense increased  for the nine months ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  due to an increase in net income before taxes and an approximate increase in the effective tax rate to 
income tax expense decreased for the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  due to a decrease in net income before taxes offset by an increase in the effective tax rate from to 
the increase in the effective tax rate in as compared to is primarily the result of the company reducing its deferred tax valuation allowance by approximately  in fiscal the valuation allowance was reduced in as the company determined the utilization of the bank s net operating loss carryforward was more likely than not based on the company s projected future earnings 
a deferred tax valuation allowance in the amount of million was recorded in the year ended march  primarily to offset the deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the governors merger 
the utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards is limited annually to specified amounts determined in accordance with the internal revenue code 
the deferred tax valuation allowance was reduced by  in due to the utilization of the governors net operating loss carryforward 
accordingly  goodwill was adjusted to offset the reduction of the valuation allowance 
liquidity liquidity is defined as the ability to meet current and future obligations of a short term nature 
the liquidity portfolio of the company totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the bank s liquidity position is strong with a regulatory liquidity ratio cash  short term and marketable assets to net deposits and short term liabilities of and at december  and  respectively 
the bank s liquid assets consist primarily of interest bearing deposits in the fhlb and marketable securities 
the company s cash inflows consist primarily of amounts generated from the sale of loans  the collection of loan principal payments  deposits and cash acquired in the banyan bank merger as well as proceeds from maturities and calls of investments held to maturity and sales of investments available for sale 
uses of cash consist of originations of loans and purchases of investments available for sale 
primary sources of borrowings include advances from the fhlb  borrowings under repurchase agreements and commercial bank lines of credit 
access to funds from depositors is affected by the rate the bank pays on certificates of deposit and convenience and service provided to transaction based account holders 
the rate the bank pays on certificates of deposits is dependent on rates paid by other financial institutions within the bank s area 
the bank manages the cash inflows and outflows from certificates of deposits by increasing or decreasing the rates offered in its market area 
the company s sources of liquidity are impacted by various matters beyond the control of the company 
scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds while loan prepayments and deposit flows vary widely in reaction to market conditions  primarily prevailing interest rates 
asset sales are influenced by the availability of loans for sale  general market demand  and other unforeseen market conditions 
the company s ability to borrow at attractive rates is affected by its credit ratings and other market conditions 
in order to manage the uncertainty inherent in its sources of funds  the company continually evaluates alternate sources of funds and maintains and develops diversity and flexibility in the number of such sources 
the effect of a decline in any one source of funds generally can be offset by use of an alternative source although potentially at a different cost to the company 
capital compliance the bank and the company are in compliance with regulatory capital requirements at december  see note to consolidated financial statements 
the bank and the company  as a bank holding company  are subject to the capital requirements of the frb 
under frb guidelines  bank holding companies such as the company are required to maintain capital based on risk adjusted assets 
under risk based capital guidelines  categories of assets with potentially higher credit risk require more capital than assets with lower risk 
in addition to balance sheet assets  bank holding companies are required to maintain capital  on a risk adjusted basis  to support certain off balance sheet activities such as loan commitments 
the frb standards classify capital into two tiers  tier i and total 
tier i risk based capital consists of common stockholder s equity  noncumulative and cumulative bank holding companies only perpetual preferred stock  and minority interests  less goodwill 
total risk based capital consists of tier i capital plus a portion of the general allowance for loan losses  hybrid capital instruments  term subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock 
in addition to risk based capital requirement  the frb requires bank holding companies to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of tier i capital to total assets 
total assets for this purpose do not include goodwill and any other intangible assets and investments that the frb determines should be deducted from tier i capital 
the frb requires banks and bank holding companies to maintain tier i and total risk based capital ratios of and  respectively  and a tier i leverage capital ratio of 
the fdic has promulgated similar regulations and guidelines regarding capital adequacy of state chartered banks which are not members of the federal reserve system  which would apply to the bank 
asset liability management management of interest rate sensitivity involves matching the maturity and repricing dates of interest earning assets with those of interest bearing liabilities in an effort to manage the impact of fluctuating interest rates on net interest margins 
the company s asset liability committee the committee meets at least quarterly to establish  communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management procedures 
the purpose of the committee is to monitor the volume and mix of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities consistent with the company s overall liquidity  capital  growth  risk and profitability goals 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the percentage of assets and liabilities in the company s existing portfolio that are subject to repricing within specific time periods 
these differences  known as interest sensitivity gaps  are usually calculated cumulatively for blocks of time 
companies that are asset sensitive a positive gap have more assets than liabilities maturing or repricing within specific time periods and these companies are likely to benefit in periods of rising interest rates  but suffer as rates decrease 
companies that are liability sensitive a negative gap are likely to benefit in periods of declining rates  but experience a negative impact on net interest income as market rates increase 
the bank manages its interest rate risk exposure by limiting the amount of long term fixed rate loans it holds for investment  increasing emphasis on shorter term  higher yield loans for portfolio  increasing or decreasing the relative amounts of long term and short term borrowings and deposits and or purchasing commitments to sell loans 
the following table presents the bank s exposure to interest rate risk at december  december  one year to to over or less years years years total dollars in thousands total interest earning assets      total interest bearing liabilities     interest rate sensitivity gap      cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap     cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets in preparing the table above  certain assumptions have been made with regard to prepayments on fixed rate mortgage and consumer loans and withdrawals of checking  now  money market and savings account deposits 
these assumptions are that the company will experience average annual prepayments of on fixed rate mortgage loans and on consumer loans 
the assumptions for checking  now  money market and savings account deposit run offs are as follows in one year or less  in to years  in to years and in over years 
all other assets and liabilities have been repriced based on the earlier of repricing or contractual maturity 
the above assumptions are annual percentages based on the latest available assumptions and on remaining balances and should not be regarded as indicative of the actual prepayments and withdrawals that may be experienced by the company 
moreover  certain shortcomings are inherent in the analysis presented by the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods for repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes to market interest rates 
also  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of or lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the assets 
moreover  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
in addition to the above  the bank is committed to fund million in new loans and million in construction loans in process at december  these loans and commitments are largely protected from interest rate fluctuations because they are either adjustable rate loans or are fixed rate loans which the bank has obtained commitments to sell in the secondary market 
this relationship is not linear or consistent with other interest rate assets and liabilities on the company s balance sheet and management uses computer modeling in its efforts to reduce the effects that interest rate fluctuations have on income 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial information presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
financial condition the company s consolidated total assets increased million or to million at december  compared to december  as a result of the banyan bank acquisition  assets increased approximately million  net due to acquiring million in assets and recording million in goodwill offset by million cash payment 
in addition  fhlb advances increased million and shareholders equity increased million as a result of the exercise of outstanding warrants and million as a result of changes in retained earnings 
these increases were offset by million in net run off of certificates of deposit 
the decrease in deposits is attributable to lowering interest rates paid on certificates of deposits since march to become aligned with the commercial bank market 
the amount of deposit run off has significantly decreased during the year ended december  compared to the run off amount of million in the nine months ended december  management expects deposit run off to continue to decrease 
loans receivable  net and loans held for sale increased million primarily due to loans acquired in connection with the banyan bank acquisition 
loan originations and purchases of approximately million offset loan repayments and sales during the year ended december  investments increased by million due to the purchase of million of mortgage backed securities partially funded with a million fhlb advance and partially funded with maturities of investments held to maturity and cash 
cash decreased approximately due primarily to deposit run off  the purchase of property and equipment and an increase in other assets 
the increase of million in property and equipment  net relates primarily to the acquisition of data processing equipment and software associated with the edp conversion  system upgrades and electronic delivery devices eg voice response system and pc banking system 
the increase in other assets of approximately million is primarily due to a  receivable due from the sba related to a loan transaction and  receivable related to an oreo sale which closed on december  consolidated total assets increased million or to million at december  from million at march   primarily due to the acquisition of the west palm beach  century bank branch purchase  net proceeds of million from the sale of common and preferred stock see note to consolidated financial statements and a million increase in fhlb advances  offset by million in net deposit run off
