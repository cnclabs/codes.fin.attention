the decrease in same store revenues was primarily a result of unusually dry weather during the second quarter  the negative impact of the summer olympics and the negative impact of a reduction in rental inventory purchases as a percentage of revenues during the first three quarters of fiscal versus fiscal product sales increased as a percentage of total revenues to for fiscal from for fiscal  as a result of i an increase in the availability and number of major hits eg  independence day  mission impossible and the nutty professor and other new release titles priced by the movie studios for sell through merchandising  ii the company s continued and increased emphasis on the sale of previously viewed rental inventory  and iii an increase in the variety of other products sold in stores  such as video accessories and confectionery items

operating costs and expenses 
store operating expenses  which reflect direct store expenses such as lease payments and in store payroll  increased slightly as a percentage of revenue from for fiscal to for fiscal the net percentage change in these expenses was primarily the result of the positive impact of reduced in store payroll costs resulting from more efficient scheduling of store employees  counterbalanced by the negative impact of increased rent expense due to the integration of developed and acquired stores into the company s base 
amortization of videocassette rental inventory increased as a percentage of revenue to for fiscal from for fiscal due to an increase in purchasing levels as a percentage of revenues 
amortization of intangibles increased as a percentage of revenues to for fiscal from for fiscal due to the substantial number of acquisitions which occurred subsequent to august and which were accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
cost of sales decreased as a percentage of product sales from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in gross margins from product sales resulted from an increase in margins on hit titles priced for sell through and from an increase in the sale of previously viewed rental inventory  the unamortized value of which is expensed to cost of sales and generally generates higher margins than other product categories 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues from for fiscal to for fiscal due to operating efficiencies attained through a larger revenue base 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary capital needs have been for opening and acquiring new stores and for the purchase of videocassette inventory 
other capital needs include the remodeling of existing stores  the relocation of existing stores and the continued upgrading and installation of the company s pos system and management information systems 
the company has funded inventory purchases  remodeling and relocation programs  new store opening costs and acquisitions primarily from cash flow from operations  the proceeds of two public equity offerings  loans under revolving credit facilities and seller financing 
during fiscal  the company generated million in adjusted ebitda versus million for fiscal adjusted ebitda is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  excluding non recurring charges and less the company s purchase of videocassette rental inventory 
included in the company s videocassette rental inventory purchases for fiscal is million associated with inventory purchases specifically for new store openings 
adjusted ebitda does not take into account capital expenditures  other than purchases of videocassette rental inventory  and does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  is not to be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurements as a measure of operating performance and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the company s definition of adjusted ebitda may not be identical to similarly titled measures of other companies 
the company believes that in addition to cash flows and net income  adjusted ebitda is a useful financial performance measurement for assessing the operating performance of the company because  together with net income and cash flows  adjusted ebitda is widely used in the videocassette specialty retailing industry to provide investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of the company to incur and service its debt and to fund acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher net income before depreciation and amortization and the non cash restructuring charge discussed above 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this decrease in funds used for investing activities is primarily the result of a decrease in the total cash expended for stores acquired during fiscal versus fiscal  partially offset by a net increase in the purchase of videocassette rental inventory resulting from the company s growth 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of a common stock public offering during fiscal  as well as a net increase in total debt of million in fiscal versus a million net increase in debt for fiscal during fiscal  the company replaced its existing million revolving credit facility with a million reducing revolving credit facility the facility 
the facility has a maturity date of june  the interest rate of the facility is libor based and the company may repay the facility at any time without penalty 
the facility has covenants that restrict borrowing based upon cash flow levels 
at january   million was outstanding under the facility with additional availability of approximately million 
the company grows its store base through internally developed and acquired stores and requires capital in excess of internally generated cash flow to achieve its desired growth 
to the extent available  future acquisitions may be completed using funds available under the facility  financing provided by sellers  alternative financing arrangements such as funds raised in public or private debt or equity offerings 
however  there can be no assurance that financing will be available to the company on terms which will be acceptable  if at all 
during fiscal  the company issued an aggregate of  shares of its common stock in connection with the acquisition of additional stores  which includes the acquisitions of home vision and hollywood video 
at january   the company had a working capital deficit of million  due to the accounting treatment of its videocassette rental inventory 
videocassette rental inventory is treated as a noncurrent asset under generally accepted accounting principles because it is not an asset which is reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle 
although the rental of this inventory generates the major portion of the company s revenue  the classification of this asset as noncurrent results in its exclusion from working capital 
the aggregate amount payable for this inventory  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  is included in working capital 
consequently  the company believes that working capital is not an appropriate measure of its liquidity and it anticipates that it will continue to operate with a working capital deficit 
the company believes its projected cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity with the facility  cash on hand and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to fund its current plan of operations for fiscal  including its anticipated new store openings 
however  to fund a resumption of the company s acquisition program  or to provide funds in the event that the company s need for funds is greater than expected  or if certain of the financing sources identified above are not available to the extent anticipated or if the company increases its growth plan  the company will need to seek additional or alternative sources of financing 
this financing may not be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
failure to obtain financing to fund the company s expansion plans or for other purposes could have a material adverse effect on the company
