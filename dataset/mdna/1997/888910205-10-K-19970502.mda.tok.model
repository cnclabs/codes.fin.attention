item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on february   the company and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware seeking to reorganize under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a company on a going concern basis  which  except as otherwise noted  contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business  however  as a result of the chapter proceedings  and circumstances relating to this event  including the company s debt structure  its operating losses  and current economic conditions  such realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities are subject to significant uncertainties 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
as reflected in the consolidated financial statements  the company experienced significant net losses in and during the chapter proceedings  the company has incurred and will continue to incur substantial reorganization costs 
the company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the confirmation of a plan of reorganization by the bankruptcy court  the ability to secure adequate exit financing and to maintain compliance with all debt covenants under the post petition financing  combined with the achievement of profitable operations 
a plan of reorganization  as finally approved by the bankruptcy court  could materially change the currently recorded amounts 
these financial statements do not reflect further adjustments to the carrying value of assets and the amounts and classifications of liabilities or shareholders equity that might be necessary as a consequence of these bankruptcy proceedings 
events completed in relation to the company s ongoing operational restructuring include the closing of ten underperforming locations and its outlet center and reductions in store operating expenses and corporate overhead

liquidity and capital resources under chapter  actions to enforce certain claims against the company are stayed if the claims arose  or are based on  events that occurred on or before the petition date of february  the ultimate terms of settlement of these claims will be determined in accordance with a plan of reorganization which requires the approval of the impaired prepetition creditors and shareholders and confirmation by the bankruptcy court 
other liabilities may arise or be subject to compromise as a result of rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases  or the bankruptcy court s resolution of claims for contingencies and other disputed amounts 
the ultimate resolution of such liabilities  all of which are subject to compromise  will be part of a plan of reorganization 
until a plan of reorganization is confirmed by the bankruptcy court  only such payments on prepetition obligations that are approved or required by the bankruptcy court will be made 
except for payments for certain property and equipment under lease  principal and interest payments on pre petition debt have not been made since the filing date and will not be made without the bankruptcy court s approval or until a plan of reorganization  defining the repayment terms  has been confirmed by the bankruptcy court 
there is no assurance at this time that a plan of reorganization will be proposed by the company and approved or confirmed by the bankruptcy court 
the company s primary source of working capital is cash flow from operations 
the company had working capital of   and  at the end of fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal and is a result of the reclassification to liabilities subject to settlement of million of current liabilities as a result of the february  bankruptcy filing 
historically  the company s working capital is at its lowest level in the first and third quarters and increases sharply in the second and fourth quarters in anticipation of the peak selling seasons 
the company measures its inventory turnover by dividing net sales by the retail value of the inventory averaged over months 
inventory turnover was times  times and times in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash used in provided by operating activities amounted to   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
these amounts primarily represent net income plus depreciation  amortization and other changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash used in investing activities amounted to   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  to fund investments for new and existing stores 
the fiscal decrease reflects the contraction in the store base that occurred during the fiscal year ended february  net cash provided by used in financing activities amounted to   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  and in fiscal and consisted primarily of additional borrowings  net of repayments  under the company s various loan agreements and in fiscal repayment of obligations incurred under capital leases 
on march   by order of the bankruptcy court  the company received final approval for the million debtor in possession revolving credit facility the dip agreement with the cit group business credit  inc the facility permits borrowings of up to million  including a letter of credit sublimit of million  through the earlier of february  or the date of substantial consummation of a plan of reorganization 
borrowings under the facility are subject to availability under a borrowing base formula 
interest is payable monthly at the bank s prime rate plus 
loans under the facility will have a superpriority administrative expense claim status under the bankruptcy code  subject to certain exceptions 
the company has had no direct borrowings under this facility since the inception of the loan 
inherent in a successful plan of reorganization is a capital structure which permits the company to generate sufficient cash flow after reorganization to meet its restructured obligations and fund the current obligations of the reorganized company 
under the bankruptcy code  the rights of and ultimate payment to prepetition creditors may be substantially altered and  as to some classes  eliminated 
at this time  the company cannot predict the outcome of the chapter filing  in general  or its effect on the future business of the company or on the ultimate interests of creditors or shareholders 
the company believes that the sources of capital above and internally generated funds will be adequate to meet the company s anticipated needs through fiscal  however  as a result of the company s chapter proceedings and the other events described above  no assurance can be given with respect to the company s liquidity 
the company currently is evaluating various alternatives for a plan of reorganization  including various forms of financing  and intends to file a plan of reorganization by june  upon emergence from the chapter proceedings  the company will need to replace the dip agreement with a suitable financing structure to meet its plan of reorganization 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the past three years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences 
a significant portion of the company s net sales and profits are realized during the fourth fiscal quarter which includes the christmas selling season and  to a lesser extent  during the second fiscal quarter 
in addition  because the company s cost of goods sold includes net alteration expense  the company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales has historically been lower in the first and third fiscal quarters primarily as the result of a lower level of net sales being spread over fixed primarily payroll expenses related to tailoring operations 
in addition  quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores 
because of the seasonality of the company s business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year
