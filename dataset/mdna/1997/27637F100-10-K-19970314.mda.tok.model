c description of business boston gas company boston gas is engaged in the transportation and sale of natural gas to approximately  residential  commercial  and industrial customers in boston  massachusetts  and other communities in eastern and central massachusetts 
boston gas also sells natural gas for resale in massachusetts and other states 
boston gas  the largest natural gas distribution company in new england  has been in business for years and is the second oldest gas company in the united states 
since  all of the common stock of boston gas has been owned by eastern 
boston gas provides local transportation services and gas supply for all customer classes 
boston gas services are available on a firm and non firm basis 
firm transportation services and sales are provided under rate tariffs filed with the massachusetts department of public utilities department that typically obligate boston gas to provide service without interruption throughout the year 
non firm transportation services and sales are generally provided to large commercial industrial customers who can use gas and oil interchangeably 
non firm services  including sales to other gas companies for resale  are provided through individually negotiated contracts and  in most cases  the price charged takes into account the price of the customer s alternative fuel 
in  the department approved boston gas proposal to unbundle local transportation service and gas sales for its largest commercial industrial customers  and in to all commercial industrial customers 
unbundling allows customers to purchase local transportation from boston gas separately from the purchase of gas supply  which the customer may buy from it or other suppliers 
boston gas views these third party suppliers as partners in marketing gas and increasing throughput and expects to work closely with them to facilitate the unbundling process and ensure a smooth transition  especially in the tracking and processing of transactions 
boston gas has also developed a program to educate customers form k about the opportunity to purchase gas from third party suppliers  while still relying on boston gas for safe and reliable delivery 
markets and competition boston gas competes with other fuel distributors  primarily oil dealers  throughout its service territory 
over the last six years  boston gas has increased its share in the total stationary energy market from to 
this market share compares to the national average of approximately and may represent a growth opportunity for boston gas 
however  actual experience cannot be predicted with certainty  and will depend on such factors as the price of competitive energy sources  the level of investment by boston gas and customer perceptions of relative value 
gas throughput the following table  in billions of cubic feet of natural gas at  btu per cubic foot bcf  provides information about boston gas throughput during the three years years ended december  residential commercial industrial off system sales total sales transportation of customer owned gas less off system sales total throughput firm throughput residential customers comprise of its customer base  while commercial industrial establishments account for the remaining 
volumetrically  residential customers account for of total throughput and of firm throughput  while commercial industrial customers account for of total throughput and of firm throughput  as depicted in the chart below 
in  approximately of the commercial industrial customers total throughput was local transportation only services 
no customer  or group of customers under common control  accounted for or more of the total firm revenues in firm throughput

form k gas supply the following table in bcf provides information about boston gas sources of supply during years ended december  natural gas pipeline purchases liquefied natural gas lng purchases total purchases change in storage gas company use  unbilled and other 
total sales year to year variations in storage gas and unbilled gas reflect variations in end of year customer requirements  due principally to weather 
given the ready availability of supply  boston gas purchased approximately two thirds of its peak pipeline supplies under short term and spot contracts 
the balance of peak day pipeline requirements are purchased directly from domestic and canadian producers and marketers pursuant to long term contracts which have been reviewed and approved by the department or by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
pipeline supplies are transported on interstate pipeline systems to boston gas service territory pursuant to long term contracts 
ferc approved tariffs provide for fixed demand charges for the firm capacity rights under these contracts 
the interstate pipeline companies that provide firm transportation service to boston gas service territory  the peak daily and annual capacity and the contract expiration dates are as follows capacity in bcf expiration pipeline daily annual dates algonquin gas transmission company algonquin tennessee gas pipeline company tennessee in addition  boston gas has firm capacity contracts on interstate pipelines upstream of the algonquin and tennessee pipelines to transport natural gas purchased by boston gas from producing regions to the algonquin and tennessee pipelines 
the expiration dates for these contracts are similar to those included in the above table 
boston gas has contracted with pipeline companies and others for the storage of natural gas in underground storage fields located in pennsylvania  new york  maryland and west virginia 
these contracts provide for storage capacity of bcf and peak day capacity of bcf 
boston gas utilizes its existing capacity contracts to transport gas from the storage fields to its service territory 
supplemental supplies of lng and propane are purchased and produced from foreign and domestic sources 
peak day throughput was bcf in and and bcf in boston gas provides for peak period demand through a least cost portfolio of pipeline  storage and supplemental supplies 
boston gas considers its peak day sendout capacity  based on its total supply resources  to be adequate to meet the requirements of its firm customers 
form k regulation boston gas operations are subject to massachusetts statutes applicable to gas utilities 
rates  gas purchases  pipeline safety regulations  issuance of securities and affiliated party transactions are regulated by the department 
rates for firm transportation and sales provided by boston gas are subject to approval by  and are on file with  the department 
in addition  boston gas has a cost of gas adjustment clause which allows for the adjustment of billing rates for firm gas sales to enable it to recover the actual cost of gas delivered to firm customers  including the demand charges for capacity on the interstate pipeline system 
on november   the department issued its order on boston gas rate restructuring and unbundling plan 
in its order  the department granted a million rate increase  effective december  in addition  the department ordered a performance based regulatory plan that prescribes a productivity offset in the formula for rate adjustments  service quality measures and potential penalties that significantly exceeded those proposed by boston gas 
boston gas has filed with the department a request for reconsideration  clarification and recalculation of certain sections of its order 
in its order  the department also approved boston gas proposal to facilitate competition by allowing all commercial and industrial customers the ability to choose alternative suppliers of natural gas beginning january  under the approved service unbundling program  commercial and industrial customers migrating from firm sales to firm transportation will be assigned  on an interim basis  a pro rata share of the cost of upstream pipeline capacity purchased by boston gas to serve them 
the department also stated that the issue of upstream pipeline capacity assignment would be addressed in future regulatory proceedings 
as more customers elect to purchase gas from other suppliers  a greater amount of upstream pipeline capacity under contract may be idle  unless it can be remarketed or assigned 
the recoverability of capacity costs will be an issue for the department to address for boson gas and all other gas utilities subject to its jurisdiction 
while there can be no assurance  it is boston gas position that it should be afforded the opportunity to recover prudently incurred  non mitigable stranded capacity cost 
boston gas and eastern were granted an intrastate exemption from the provisions of the public utility holding company act of under section a thereof  pursuant to an order of the securities and exchange commission dated february   as amended by orders dated november  and august  seasonality and working capital boston gas revenues  earnings and cash flows are highly seasonal as the demand for most of its transportation services and sales is directly related to temperature conditions 
the majority of boston gas earnings is generated in the first quarter  with a seasonal loss occurring in the third quarter 
since the bulk of its revenues is billed in the november through april heating season  significant cash flows are generated from late winter to early summer 
in addition  through the cost of gas adjustment clause  boston gas bills its customers over the heating season for pipeline demand charges paid by boston gas over the entire year 
this difference  along with other costs of gas distributed but unbilled  is reflected as deferred gas costs and is financed through short term borrowings 
short term borrowings are also required from time to time to finance normal business operations 
as a result of these factors  short term borrowings are generally highest during the late fall and early winter 
form k environmental matters boston gas may have or share responsibility under applicable environmental law for the remediation of certain former manufactured gas plant mgp sites  as described in note of notes to financial statements 
a subsidiary of new england electric system has assumed responsibility for remediating of the such sites owned by boston gas  subject to a limited contribution by boston gas 
a regulatory settlement with the department provides for recovery by boston gas of environmental costs associated with mgp sites over separate  seven year amortization periods without a return on the unamortized balance 
boston gas does not possess at this time sufficient information to reasonably determine the ultimate cost to it of such remediation and no assurance can be given with respect to the future recoverability of such costs 
however  in light of the factors discussed above  boston gas believes that it is not probable that such costs will materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
employees as of december   boston gas had approximately  employees  of whom were organized in local unions with which boston gas has collective bargaining agreements that expire in properties boston gas owns or leases facilities which enable it to liquefy natural gas in periods of low demand  store the resulting lng and vaporize it for use in periods of high demand 
boston gas owns and operates such a facility in dorchester  massachusetts  and leases one such facility in lynn  massachusetts 
in addition  boston gas leases a storage facility in salem  massachusetts 
negotiations are under way with the lessor of the lynn and salem facilities in connection with the scheduled expiration of these leases in june boston gas also owns propane air facilities at several locations throughout its service territory 
on december   boston gas distribution system included approximately  miles of gas mains   services and  active customer meters 
a majority of the gas mains consist of cast iron and bare steel which requires ongoing maintenance and replacement 
boston gas mains and services are generally located on public ways or private property not owned by it 
boston gas occupation of such property is generally pursuant to easements  licenses  permits or grants of location 
except as stated above  the principal items of property of boston gas are owned in fee 
in  boston gas capital expenditures were million 
capital expenditures were principally made for system replacement  for system expansion to meet customer demand and for productivity enhancement initiatives 
boston gas plans to spend approximately million for similar purposes in midland enterprises inc midland  through its wholly owned subsidiaries together midland  is engaged in the operation of a fleet of barges and towboats  principally on the ohio and mississippi rivers and their tributaries  the gulf intracoastal waterway and the gulf of mexico 
midland transports dry bulk commodities  a major portion of which is coal 
midland also performs repair work on marine equipment and operates two coal dumping terminals  a phosphate rock and phosphate chemical fertilizer terminal and a marine fuel supply facility 
in june  midland sold its barge construction and repair facility located in louisiana 
form k sales midland transported million  million and million tons in  and  respectively 
tonnage in declined from  primarily as a result of reduced grain tonnage due in part to a shortage of grain supplies and the resulting weak demand for barge towing on the lower mississippi river 
tonnage in declined slightly from due in part to a softening of the domestic coal market in the second half of and reduced shipments of aggregates 
ton miles are the product of tons and distance transported 
the following charts depict tonnage by commodity and ton miles of cargo transported for the period tonnage by commodity 
pie chart 
coal grain other ton miles by commodity in billions 
bar chart 
coal grain other liquid total other includes sand  stone  gravel  iron  scrap  steel  coke  phosphate  towing for others  and other dry cargo 
in  ton miles declined from the record level set in due to lower tonnage  as discussed above  and slightly shorter average trip lengths due to reduced shipments of long haul grain and export coal tonnage 
ton mile production in increased over  although tonnage declined slightly  due to longer trip lengths associated with increased movements of non coal tonnage  predominantly on the mississippi river 
in addition to changes in ton miles transported  midland s revenues and net income are affected by other factors such as competitive conditions  weather and the segment of the river system traveled  as described further in the seasonality and competition sections 
the following table summarizes midland s backlog of transportation and terminalling business under multi year contracts december  tons in millions revenues in millions portions of revenue backlog not expected to be filled within the current year the revenue backlog which is based on contracts that extend beyond december  is shown at prices in effect on december   which are subject to cost escalation de escalation provisions 
since services under many of the multi year contracts are based on customer requirements  midland has estimated its backlog based on its forecast of the anticipated requirements of these contract customers 
the decline in tonnage backlog from partially reflects the expiration of two utility coal contracts and the elapsing terms of current multi year contracts as they draw closer to maturity  including those excluded from the calculation as they enter their final year 
the above backlog amounts include contracts awarded but not yet signed at year end of million tons and million in revenues for and million tons and million in revenues for the decrease in the revenue backlog is consistent with the reduction in backlog tonnage 
electric utilities  which traditionally have entered into multi year transportation and coal supply agreements  have begun to shorten the term of some agreements form k for reasons such as clean air act requirements and the trend toward deregulation of the electric power industry 
these factors have also led to changes in the sourcing of coal by utilities  leading to changes in traffic patterns 
the only significant raw material required by midland is the diesel fuel to operate its towboats 
diesel fuel is purchased from a variety of sources and midland regards the availability of diesel fuel as adequate for its operations 
seasonality revenues during winter months tend to be lower than revenues for the remainder of the year due to the freezing of some northern rivers and waterways  increased coal consumption by electric utilities during the summer months and the fall harvest of grain 
competition midland s marine transportation business competes on the basis of price  service and equipment availability 
midland s primary competitors include other barge lines and railroads  including one integrated rail barge carrier 
there are a number of companies offering transportation services on the waterways served by midland 
in the early s  competition among major barge line companies was intense due to an imbalance between barge supply and customer demand  impacted by occasionally weak grain and export coal markets 
this in turn led to revenue and margin erosion and prompted improvements in cost and productivity and some industry consolidation 
during the second half of  however  barge demand and supply approached equilibrium as both domestic import demand and export requirements increased significantly 
this trend continued in and the first half of however  a shortage of grain supplies and sharply higher grain prices slowed demand in late and created uncertainty over near term shipment levels 
coupled with an increased availability of new equipment  a temporary imbalance of supply and demand has again been created which has led to more intense competition and decreased spot rates 
improvements in operating efficiencies have permitted barge operators to maintain comparatively low rate structures 
consequently  the barge industry has generally been able to retain its competitive position with alternate methods of transportation for bulk commodities  particularly when the origin and destination of such movements are near or contiguous to navigable waterways 
no customer  or group of customers under common control  accounted for or more of the total revenues in on the basis of past experience and its competitive position  midland considers that the simultaneous loss of several of its largest customers  while possible  is unlikely to happen 
midland s multi year transportation and terminalling contracts expire at various dates from april through december during  approximately of midland s revenues resulted from these contracts 
a substantial portion of the contracts provide for rate adjustments based on changes in various costs  including diesel fuel costs  and  additionally  contain force majeure clauses that excuse performance by the parties to the contracts when performance is prevented by circumstances beyond their reasonable control 
many of these contracts have provisions for termination for specified causes  such as material breach of contract  environmental restrictions on the burning of coal  or loss by the customer of an underlying commodity supply contract 
penalties for termination for such causes are not generally specified 
however  some contracts provide that in the event of an uncured material breach by midland that results in termination of the contract  midland would be responsible for reimbursing its customer for the differential between the contract price and the cost of substituted performance 
towboats  such as those operated by midland  are capable of moving in one tow barge configuration approximately  tons of cargo equivalent to one hundred ton capacity railroad cars on the ohio river and upper mississippi river and approximately  tons equivalent to one hundred ton capacity railroad cars on the lower mississippi river  where there are no locks to transit  at average costs per ton mile which are generally below those of railroads 
form k environmental matters midland is subject to the provisions of the federal water pollution control act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  the superfund amendment and reauthorization act  the resource conservation and recovery act of  and the oil pollution act of  which permit the coast guard and the environmental protection agency to assess penalties and clean up costs for oil  hazardous substance  and hazardous waste discharges 
some of these acts also allow third parties to seek damages for losses caused by such discharges 
compliance with these acts has had no material effect on midland s capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position  and no such effect is anticipated 
properties as of december   midland s marine equipment consisted of  dry cargo barges and towboats 
approximately half of this equipment is either mortgaged to secure midland s equipment financing obligations or chartered under long term leases from third parties 
in  midland s capital expenditures were million 
these expenditures were made principally for the purchase of new barges and for renewal of equipment 
in midland expects to spend approximately million for capital equipment  primarily for the purchase of new barges to replace aging equipment 
employees as of december   midland employed approximately  persons  of whom approximately are represented by labor unions 
allenergy marketing company  llc allenergy is an unregulated retail energy marketing company that expects to provide a comprehensive array of energy commodities and related products and services to customers  principally in the northeast 
it was formed in september  through the combination of eastern s and new england electric system s existing unregulated retail energy marketing subsidiaries  allenergy marketing company  inc and nees energy  inc  respectively  and is owned equally by both companies 
eastern had formed allenergy marketing company  inc  in april energy marketing companies currently compete mainly on the basis of commodity prices 
in addition  allenergy intends to offer value added energy related services

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to financial statements 
form k compared to overview the company reported net earnings of million  or per share  in  compared to net earnings of million  or per share  in net earnings in included an extraordinary charge of million or 
per share  as described in note excluding gains on sales of investments  earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations in increased by approximately and  respectively  over the prior year  which was adjusted to exclude a gain on the sale of eastern s united states filter corporation us filter investment and a provision for environmental expenses 
in millions change revenues boston gas midland total  the increase in consolidated revenues from to primarily reflects higher customer usage  colder weather  and increased sales to new customers for boston gas and increased demand for coal and other commodities at midland 
in millions change operating earnings boston gas midland headquarters total the increase in operating earnings from to primarily reflects the gross margin impact of boston gas increased revenues  as described above 
other income in includes increased interest income on higher cash and investment balances and decreased interest expense  reflecting lower average rates principally due to the refinancing of million of boston gas debentures in december and lower balances of short term obligations 
partly offsetting were the absence in of the million gain on the sale of eastern s us filter investment and a million provision for environmental expenses  as described in notes and in  other income includes a loss of million  representing eastern s share of allenergy s operating results 
the effective tax rate in was higher than in  principally because the gain on the sale of the us filter investment was offset by the tax loss realized on the sale of waterpro  which had been written down in boston gas revenues in increased by million due principally to higher average customer usage  the impact of colder weather  increased sales to new customers and increased non firm sales 
the migration of firm sales to transportation only service was partially offsetting 
weather for was colder than normal 
weather for was normal 
operating earnings increased million from  primarily reflecting the gross margin impact of increased revenues 
cost reductions from ongoing reengineering programs  the absence of severance costs and lower consulting expenses also contributed to the increase in operating earnings 
wage increases and higher charges for depreciation were partially offsetting 
form k midland enterprises revenues and operating earnings increased by million and million  respectively  in over  primarily reflecting the continued strong demand for coal and other dry cargo commodities and favorable rates 
severe icing and flooding during the first quarter of and generally more difficult operating conditions later in the year resulted in higher operating costs and lower fleet productivity than in tonnage and ton miles decreased and  respectively  reflecting shorter average hauls due to reduced foreign demand for coal and a shortage of grain supplies 
coal tonnage and ton miles increased and  respectively  to record levels reflecting significantly increased shipments of domestic spot coal  while coal shipments under multi year contracts for utilities declined due to the non renewal of several contracts 
non coal tonnage and ton miles declined as a result of weaker barge demand for grain exports on the lower mississippi river 
operating results from terminal and support facilities were slightly improved over ongoing programs to increase fleet productivity were offset by adverse operating conditions and traffic pattern inefficiencies caused by the reduced export tonnage 
fuel costs increased in due to rising fuel prices that averaged above levels 
a substantial portion of midland s multi year contracts contain fuel adjustment clauses to compensate for higher costs 
compared to in millions change revenues boston gas midland total the increase in consolidated revenues from to primarily reflects significant increases in midland s rates for transporting non coal commodities 
in millions change operating earnings boston gas midland headquarters total the increase in operating earnings from to primarily reflects increased non coal transportation rates and ideal operating conditions at midland  partially offset by the impact of demand related factors and warmer weather as well as costs associated with early retirement and severance programs at boston gas and higher unallocated headquarters expense 
other income in includes a million gain on the sale of eastern s us filter investment and increased interest income on higher cash balances  partly offset by a million provision for environmental expenses 
other income for includes a million gain on the sale of midland s barge construction and repair facility in louisiana 
the effective tax rate in was lower than in  principally because there was no tax on the gain on the sale of the us filter investment  as discussed above 
boston gas revenues in decreased by million as increased sales to new and existing firm customers were more than offset by demand related factors involving a reduction in weather adjusted gas consumption 
weather for was of normal  which was warmer than increased revenues from non firm sales and transportation were partially offsetting 
form k operating earnings decreased million from sales to new firm customers and the recognition of lost margins associated with conservation programs increased operating earnings  partly offsetting the impact of reduced demand and warmer weather 
higher operating costs  primarily reflecting non recurring charges associated with early retirement and severance programs for both management and union employees were partially offset by the related reduction in labor costs and reduced weather related workload during the first half of the year 
these reductions were part of boston gas ongoing reengineering program focused on improving customer service and lowering operating costs 
midland enterprises revenues and operating earnings increased by million and million  respectively  in over  primarily reflecting higher transportation rates 
partially offsetting were reduced revenues resulting from contractual rate reductions on multi year utility coal contracts 
operating earnings benefited from continued productivity improvements and excellent operating conditions 
ton miles increased to a new record level  although total tonnage transported declined  due to significantly longer trip lengths 
coal tonnage declined  with coal shipments under multi year contracts increasing and spot coal tonnage declining  reflecting a weak second half market 
non coal ton miles increased although tonnage was essentially unchanged from midland s focus on longer haul  higher margin non coal commodities more than offset the weakness in the spot coal market 
as a result  grain tonnage increased with ores and steel tonnage up as compared to operating results from terminal and support operations were relatively unchanged from levels 
forward looking information this report and other company reports and statements issued or made from time to time contain certain forward looking statements concerning projected future financial performance  expected plans or future operations 
eastern cautions that actual results and developments may differ materially from such projections or expectations 
investors should be aware of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking projections or expectations 
these factors include  but are not limited to temperatures above or below normal in boston gas service area  changes in market conditions for barge transportation  adverse operating conditions on the inland waterways  uncertainties regarding the start up of allenergy  including expense levels and customer response  changes in interest rates  regulatory decisions  including without limitation  decisions on boston gas request for reconsideration of the massachusetts department of public utilities rate restructuring order and developments with respect to eastern s previously disclosed environmental and coal act liabilities 
all of these factors are difficult to predict and are generally beyond eastern s control 
liquidity and capital resources management believes that projected cash flow from operations  in combination with currently available resources  is more than sufficient to meet eastern s capital expenditure and working capital requirements  potential funding of its coal act and environmental liabilities  normal debt repayments and anticipated dividends to shareholders 
in addition to cash and marketable investments of million at december   eastern maintains a million long term revolving credit agreement plus uncommitted lines  all of which are available for general corporate purposes 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under any of these facilities 
consolidated capital expenditures for are budgeted at approximately million  about equally divided between boston gas and midland 
eastern s capital structure is depicted in the chart on the facing page 
the decrease in equity in reflects the impact of non cash charges associated with the provision for coal act liabilities  the write down of waterpro goodwill  the loss on the sale of ionpure and substantial share repurchases 
through a combination of increased equity and debt  eastern expects to continue its policy of capitalizing form k boston gas and midland with approximately equal amounts of equity and long term debt 
both subsidiaries maintain a ratings with the major rating agencies 
the chart below shows improvements in interest coverage at boston gas and midland 
to meet working capital requirements which reflect the seasonal nature of the local gas distribution business  boston gas had commercial paper outstanding of million at december   an increase of million from the prior year  primarily reflecting higher balances for deferred gas costs 
in addition  boston gas maintains a bank credit agreement which supports the issuance of up to million of commercial paper to fund its inventory of gas supplies

on september   eastern and new england electric system nees formed allenergy  an unregulated retail energy marketing company that is intended to provide a comprehensive array of energy commodities and related products and services to customers in the northeast 
allenergy combined eastern s and nees existing unregulated retail energy marketing subsidiaries  allenergy marketing company  inc and nees energy  inc  respectively  and is owned equally by both companies 
the participation of nees and nees energy  inc in the joint venture was approved by the securities and exchange commission on december  eastern may have or share responsibility for environmental remediation and or ongoing maintenance of certain non utility sites associated with former operations  the most significant of which is a former coal tar processing facility  as described in note eastern has accrued a reserve of approximately million in total at december   to cover the potential remediation and maintenance costs of these sites 
however  eastern does not possess at this time sufficient information to reasonably determine or estimate the ultimate cost to it of such remediation and maintenance 
boston gas may have or share responsibility for environmental remediation of certain former manufactured gas plant mgp sites  as described in note a subsidiary of nees has assumed responsibility for remediating of the such sites owned by boston gas  subject to a limited contribution by the latter 
a regulatory settlement agreement provides for recovery by boston gas of environmental costs associated with mgp sites over separate  seven year amortization periods without a form k return on the unamortized balance 
eastern does not possess at this time sufficient information to reasonably determine the ultimate cost to boston gas of such remediation  and no assurance can be given with respect to the future recoverability of such costs 
however  in light of the factors discussed  eastern currently believes that it is not probable that such costs will materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
eastern has accrued pretax charges of million for its estimated undiscounted liability for health care and death benefit premiums under the coal act 
as discussed in note  its obligations for these premiums could range from a nominal amount to more than million
