item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company primarily serves both specialty retail and mass merchandise store chains by designing  merchandising  contracting for the manufacture of and selling casual  moderately priced apparel  primarily for women  under private label 
the company s major customers include specialty retailers  such as lerner new york  limited stores  lane bryant and express  all of which are divisions of the limited  and mass merchandisers  such as target stores 
the company s products are manufactured in a variety of woven and knit fabrications and include jeanswear  casual pants  t shirts  shorts  blouses  shirts and other tops  dresses  leggings and jackets 
on july   the company closed an initial public offering the offering of  shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share 
the proceeds to the company  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  were million 
concurrent with the closing of the offering  the company changed its tax status from an s corporation to a c corporation for income tax purposes 
concurrent with the closing of the offering  the original shareholders granted a four year option the lda option to limited direct associates  lp lda  a limited partnership  the general and limited partners of which are subsidiaries of the limited  and the company granted registration rights to lda pertaining to the option shares 
historically  sales to divisions of the limited have represented a significant portion of the company s sales 
subject to certain anti dilution provisions  the lda option grants lda the right to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of the company s outstanding common stock at a price per share of 
for accounting purposes  even though the lda option was granted by shareholders  and will not cover any shares of the company s unissued common stock  the lda option has been treated as though it was granted by the company 
accordingly  in the quarter ended september   the company recorded a non recurring charge to earnings  in the amount of million  which equals the million estimated fair market value of the lda option plus the  estimated value of the expenses of registration of the offer and sale of the option shares 
the million component of this charge was offset by an equal credit to contributed capital because the company s capital structure was not affected by the grant of the lda option 
the  component of this charge was recorded as an accrued expense 
because of the credit to contributed capital  the net impact of this charge on shareholders equity was  factors that may affect future results this report on form k contains forward looking statements which are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth below 
variability of quarterly results 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  a substantial variation in its net sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company believes that the factors which influence this variability of quarterly results include the timing of the company s introduction of new product lines  the level of consumer acceptance of each new product line  general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending and retailer purchasing  the availability of manufacturing capacity  the seasonality of the markets in which the company participates  the timing of trade shows  the product mix of customer orders  the timing of the placement or cancellation of customer orders  the occurrence of chargebacks in excess of reserves and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales and actions of competitors 
accordingly  a comparison of the company s results of operations from period to period is not necessarily meaningful  and the company s results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
economic conditions 
the apparel industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variation  and a recession in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits have in the past had  and may in the future have  a materially adverse effect on the company results of operations 
in addition  certain retailers  including some of the company customers  have experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  financial difficulties which increase the risk of extending credit to such retailers 
these retailers have attempted to improve their own operating efficiencies by concentrating their purchasing power among a narrowing group of vendors 
there can be no assurance that the company will remain a preferred vendor for its existing customers 
a decrease in business from or loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company has entered into a non recourse accounts receivable factoring agreement 
there can be no assurance that the company s factor will approve the extension of credit to certain retail customers in the future 
if a customer s credit is not approved by the factor  the company could either assume the collection risk on sales to the customer itself  require that the customer provide a letter of credit or choose not to make sales to the customer 
reliance on key customers 
in  affiliated stores owned by the limited  including lerner new york  limited stores and lane bryant  accounted for of the company s net sales and target stores accounted for of the company s net sales 
the loss of any such customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
from time to time  certain of the company s major customers have experienced financial difficulties 
the company does not have long term contracts with any of its customers and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that any customer will continue to place orders with the company to the same extent it has in the past  or at all 
in addition  the company s results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon the commercial success of its major customers 
dependence on contract manufacturers 
all of the company s products  with the exception of certain test runs and samples  are manufactured by independent cutting  sewing and finishing contractors 
the use of contract manufacturers and the resulting lack of direct control over the production of its products could result in the company s failure to receive timely delivery of products of acceptable quality 
although the company believes that alternative sources of cutting  sewing and finishing services are readily available  the loss of one or more contract manufacturers could have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations until an alternative source is located and has commenced producing the company s products 
price and availability of raw materials 
cotton fabric is the principal raw material used in the company s apparel 
although the company believes that its suppliers will continue to be able to procure a sufficient supply of cotton fabric for its production needs  the price and availability of cotton may fluctuate significantly depending on supply  world demand  and currency fluctuations  each of which may affect the price and availability of cotton fabric 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in the price and availability of cotton fabric or other raw materials used by the company will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
management of growth 
since its inception  the company has experienced rapid growth in sales 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in maintaining or increasing its sales in the future 
any future growth in sales will require additional working capital and may place a significant strain on the company s management  management information systems  inventory management  production capability  distribution facilities and receivables management 
any disruption in the company s order processing  sourcing or distribution systems could cause orders to be shipped late  and under industry practices  retailers generally can cancel orders or refuse to accept goods due to late shipment 
such cancellations and returns would result in a reduction in revenue  increased administrative and shipping costs and a further burden on the company distribution facilities 
in addition  the failure to timely enhance the company s operating systems  or unexpected difficulties in implementing such enhancements  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
foreign manufacturing 
approximately of the company products were imported in as a result  the company s operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad  including  among other things  transportation delays  economic or political instability  currency fluctuations  restrictions on the transfer of funds and the imposition of tariffs  export duties  quotas and other trade restrictions

as is typical for the company  quarterly net sales fluctuated significantly because the company s customers typically place bulk orders with the company  and a change in the number of orders shipped in any one period may have a material effect on the net sales for that period
