comparison of fiscal with fiscal net sales 
the company s net sales decreased in fiscal by approximately three percent to million from million in fiscal while overall net sales decreased during the period  net sales in the company s high performance plastics and coated fabrics segments increased in the aggregate approximately three percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal such increase was offset by decreased net sales in the specialty adhesives segment resulting principally from the ensolite sale  the prices received by the company for its roofing adhesives and sealants under the firestone agreement  which are generally lower than those which the company had historically been able to obtain in the relevant market  and the impact on the commercial roofing sector generally of severe winter weather conditions in the northeastern united states 
see item business business segments specialty adhesives and note to consolidated financial statements 
net sales in the high performance plastics segment increased in fiscal by approximately three percent to approximately million from million in fiscal this increase was principally due to increased sales prices and unit volume of the royalite division s specialty thermoplastic sheet 
decreases in the unit volume of royalite s general purpose thermoplastic sheet partially offset such increase 
management believes that this shift in unit volume resulted  in part  from its efforts to focus on the production of specialty sheet for sale in niche markets rather than on the production of general purpose sheet 
see item business business segments high performance plastics royalite division 
increases in unit volume sales of both specialty and general purpose acrylic sheet by the polycast division also contributed to such increase in net sales 
these increases were partially offset by decreased sales prices for aerospace specialty acrylic sheet in response to market conditions 
the coated fabrics segment s net sales increased in fiscal approximately five percent to million from million in fiscal this increase resulted principally from increased sales prices for  and unit volume of  products sold to the automotive industry 
increased sales to the automotive industry resulted principally from the company s introduction of a new product line see item business business segments coated fabrics qualified for use in the manufacture of several automobile models by general motors 
this increase was partially offset by decreased net sales of naugahyde r coated vinyl products resulting primarily from a delay in developing and marketing products in new styles and patterns which in fiscal were generally in greater demand than the styles and patterns offered by the company 
in response to such market conditions  the company employed a designer in in order to design and commence production of newer styles and patterns

in fiscal  the company incurred a loss before interest  income taxes and extraordinary item of million as compared to income before interest  income taxes and extraordinary item of million for fiscal this loss resulted from factors which impacted all of the company s segments 
the performance of the high performance plastics segment was impacted principally by a back pay labor settlement at polycast and costs of implementing quality assurance programs and improved manufacturing efficiency at royalite 
in the coated fabrics segment  the company established reserves totaling approximately million related to its decision to exit the port clinton  ohio automotive operations 
see note to consolidated financial statements

income before interest  income taxes and extraordinary item for the high performance plastics segment decreased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal primarily as a result of higher mma costs on average and an  charge incurred for estimated back pay and retraining costs in connection with the settlement of a strike at polycast s stamford  connecticut facility and a temporary decline in manufacturing efficiency at such facility during fiscal as a result of the required retraining of employees returning from the strike 
in addition  royalite incurred approximately  in consulting fees for production and reengineering studies relating to its warsaw  indiana facility and certain additional costs in connection with the implementation of improved quality standards  training and support programs for employees and a more efficient manufacturing process at such facility 
the coated fabrics segment s loss before interest  income taxes and extraordinary item increased in fiscal to approximately million from a loss of approximately million in fiscal in fiscal the company established reserves totaling approximately million related to its decision to exit the port clinton  ohio automotive operation 
the automotive products business incurred operating losses of approximately million before consideration of reserves totaling million described above and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  the increased losses resulted from decreased sales of instrument panels for a transplant automotive customer as a result of defective adhesion materials provided by one of the company s suppliers and the continued incurrence of fixed costs associated with the operation of such facility at less than percent of its capacity as a result of the decreased sales caused by such defective adhesion 
while the production problems caused by such defective materials have been satisfactorily resolved  the port clinton  ohio facility has continued to operate at significantly reduced levels as the company sought to recover the segment s lost automotive sales and to expand the segment s sales in the automotive sector generally 
income before interest  income taxes and extraordinary item for the specialty adhesives segment decreased in fiscal to  from approximately million in fiscal this decrease resulted from the decreased sales resulting principally from the effect of the ensolite sale  the impact of reduced sales prices for roofing adhesives under the firestone agreement and the effect on the epdm roofing adhesives market of severe winter weather conditions in the northeastern united states which caused delays in the commercial roofing industry and increased costs at the company s mishawaka  indiana manufacturing facility resulting from general energy price increases 
energy prices represented a significant cost of operating the mishawaka  indiana facility 
due to its configuration and applicable fire and safety regulations  the entire facility had to be heated and lighted even though the company s operations occupied less than percent of the facility 
the specialty adhesives segment relocated its operations from the mishawaka  indiana facility to its facility in south bend  indiana in february  see item business business segments specialty adhesives manufacturing facilities 
the effects of these items were partially offset by reduced costs of raw materials and an approximately million gain from the ensolite sale 
the gain from the ensolite sale is net of an approximately million reserve established in fiscal for fixed asset write offs  severance and incentive packages for ensolite employees to be terminated and facility clean up costs 
in prior years  the company established a relocation reserve for its planned restructuring and move of the specialty adhesives segment 
management believes that such reserves are adequate to cover the costs to be incurred in connection with the relocation of the specialty adhesives segments to the new plant at south bend  indiana

the company at september   had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents as compared to approximately million at september  working capital at september  was approximately million compared to approximately million at september  the company had borrowings of approximately million under its million revolving credit agreement at september  see note to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that cash from its operations and its ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility mentioned above provide it sufficient liquidity to finance its existing level of operations and meet its debt service obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s operations together with amounts available under the revolving credit facility will continue to be sufficient to finance its existing level of operations and meet its debt service obligations 
the company s ability to meet its debt service and other obligations depends on its future performance  which in turn  is subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond the company s control 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  it may be required to refinance all or a portion of its existing debt or obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such refinancing or additional financing 
effects of inflation the markets in which the company sells products are competitive 
in particular  the company has encountered in connection with its sales of coated fabrics to the automotive industry and its sales of acrylics to the aerospace industry  effective resistance to price increases generally 
thus  in an inflationary environment the company may not in all instances be able to pass through to consumers general price increases  in which event the company s operations may be materially impacted if such conditions were to occur 
the company has not in the past been adversely impacted by general price inflation
