item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the company has historically engaged in providing outsourced staffing services engineering  technical  and airport management to agencies of the united states government  government prime contractors  and local government agencies 
to broaden its existing outsourced staffing services business  the company acquired a commercial outsourced staffing services company in august during the past three years  the company  through its subsidiary  comarco wireless technologies  inc  has invested more of its resources in developing products for the wireless communications industry 
this effort has resulted in comarco realizing over of its operating income from this business area 
summarized financial information by business segment for the company s fiscal year  which ended january   is as follows wireless outsourced communications staffing services corporate products and other revenue and other total dollars in thousands revenues    operating income    identifiable assets     wireless communications products the company s wireless communications products business  through its subsidiary  comarco wireless technologies  inc  is presently comprised of three product families field measurement products  revenue assurance products and wireless applications products 
o field measurement products provide a method for benchmarking and analyzing the performance of wireless system networks 
the field measurement product line includes the generation ii cellular survey system  the nes network evaluation system  the nrs network readiness system  the cdpd data survey product  and the company s latest product introduction  the lt  which permits day to day network performance monitoring of cellular and pcs networks 
o the revenue assurance product line includes system products and services that test the integrity of cellular carriers billing systems 
o wireless applications products include wireless data telemetry systems and emergency callbox systems 
the company s wireless data telemetry system is the cellular data gateway that is used to transport data and is optimized for wide area applications 
in october  the company purchased certain callbox product line assets from gte 
the installed base purchased from gte consists of over  units  of which approximately  are being serviced by the company under long term maintenance contracts 
in addition  in february  the company acquired certain callbox product line assets of cubic communications  inc the installed base purchased from cubic communications consists of approximately  units 
the combination of the two product lines establishes the company as a major vendor to this niche of the wireless application products marketplace 
comarco wireless technologies revenues increased to of the company s total revenue in fiscal year  a increase over the prior fiscal year 
operating income increased year to year and represented of the company s consolidated operating income for fiscal year continued growth in comarco wireless revenues and income is predicated on a number of factors  including the continued success of the company s product development efforts  a continued geographical expansion to international markets and continued acceptance of the company s products by its customers  none of which can be assured 
international sales in fiscal year totalled million  up from million in the prior fiscal year 
the company expects this segment of its business to continue to grow 
marketing and post contract customer support offices have recently been opened and staffed in singapore and london  england 
product development as part of its product development program  the company is continuing its product development program in its wireless communications business 
because a common thread of technology runs through all comarco wireless product lines  the company believes that it can leverage its investment and maintain the focus and concentration of its technical and marketing resources  although there can be no assurance in that regard 
the company in general has been developing and continues to plan to develop products that will be compatible with all wireless communications air interfaces worldwide 
new products this year included gsm and cdma air interface products and the introduction of our lt platform to our field measurement product line 
the company s wireless product life cycle is estimated to be two to five years  depending on the product 
the company is also continuing its development of a new product line  a rechargeable power adapter for laptop computers and cellular telephones 
the objective of this product is to be smaller  lighter and more versatile than existing products on the market and is based on the company s patented power transfer technology 
the product is currently in fcc and ul testing 
potential customers would include after market and original equipment manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in bringing this product to market  or that this product will be successful 
if the company is successful  the production  marketing  and sale of this product will require a significant amount of working capital for the financing of inventory and accounts receivable 
the company plans to continue to invest substantially in product development efforts 
its products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving standards  and continuous improvements in products and services 
the company s future prospects will depend in part on its ability to enhance the functionality of its existing products in a timely and cost effective manner and to identify  develop  and achieve market acceptance of new products that address new technologies and standards and meet customer needs in the wireless communications marketplace 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to respond to technological advances  changes in customer requirements  or changes in regulatory requirements or industry standards  and any significant delays in development  introduction or shipment of products  or achievement of acceptable product costs  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
as part of its product development program  the company is continuing its software product development program in its wireless communications business 
during fiscal year and fiscal year  the company s wireless communications business capitalized approximately million and million of software product development costs  respectively  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards number  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
of the amounts capitalized  million and million  respectively  were amortized in fiscal years and against product sales in accordance with statement no 
in addition  during fiscal years   and  comarco wireless had expenditures of million  million and  respectively  for research and development expenses includes company sponsored software development costs prior to determination of technological feasibility on current and anticipated products 
backlog the value of unfilled orders at comarco wireless as of january  is approximately million  compared to million as of january  the current year balance includes million of product orders for the field measurement and revenue assurance product lines  and million of deferred revenue for basic and extended warranty commitments 
management believes that approximately of this backlog amount of million will result in revenue during fiscal year in general  most of the company s products orders are filled within months from the receipt of the order 
the remaining value of unfilled orders of million is related to the callbox product line 
this backlog balance consists of million of long term maintenance agreements and a million contract to upgrade the los angeles county callbox system to comply with the americans with disabilities act s requirements for use by hearing and speech impaired individuals 
the company currently expects the majority of the los angeles contract to be performed in the latter half of fiscal year seasonality comarco wireless has experienced in each of the past three years a seasonal fluctuation in wireless communications products activity  with greater sales in the third and fourth quarters of its fiscal year and lesser amounts in the first and second quarters 
this fluctuation may or may not continue due to a number of factors  including the timing  cancellation  or delay of customer orders  the timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors  the size of customers capital budgets  which are the traditional source of customer funding for the purchase of the company s products  market acceptance of the company and its customers products  and other competitive factors 
therefore  the nature of the wireless communications products business is inherently unpredictable and sales and profits may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
marketing  sales distribution comarco wireless maintains its own internal sales force for the marketing and sales of the company s product offerings in the united states 
the company has established a network of agents and distributors for the coordination of sales activity outside of the united states 
in addition  the company has opened and staffed marketing and customer support offices in singapore and london  england to service asia and europe  respectively 
this expansion overseas faces a number of inherent barriers  including the need for export licenses  tariffs and other potential trade restrictions  and changes in laws governing the imposition of duties  quotas  taxes  or other charges relating to the import or export of its products 
the company currently has limited experience in penetrating the foreign marketplace and  therefore  companies having a presence or already doing business overseas may have a competitive advantage over the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s international operations will be successful 
capital requirements comarco wireless working capital needs primarily consist of the cost of the upfront product development effort required to expand the company s product offerings  inventory requirements  including long lead time materials  and the financing of accounts receivable  which will generally become longer upon the company s planned geographical expansion into europe  asia and latin america 
certain components used by the company in its existing products are only available from single sources  and certain other components are presently available or acquired only from a limited number of suppliers 
in the event that any of its single source suppliers are unable to fulfill company requirements or discontinue the manufacture of a key component  the company may experience an interruption in production 
the radio interface devices designed into the company s products are key purchased components whose lack of availability could have a material adverse impact on sales and profits 
working capital requirements are expected to be financed from operations and the financial resources of the company 
technical requirements comarco wireless is selling its products into a market that is growing rapidly and technological obsolescence and market timing of product introductions is critical for success 
in the development of new or expanded product offerings  the company s access to the technical design of air interface devices is essential for the company to anticipate and develop compatible wireless communications products 
the inability to obtain the technical designs on a timely basis will have a direct impact on product design and schedule and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
employees as of april   comarco wireless employed approximately employees 
the company believes its employee relations to be good 
the majority of the company s employees are professional or technical personnel having training and experience in engineering  computer science  and management 
the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing  and management personnel  and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process  and test engineers involved in the development of new products 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
recognizing this reality  the company has instituted a long term incentive stock option plan for key comarco wireless employees  whereby they will directly participate in the success of comarco wireless see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company obtains its employees through a variety of means including advertisements  technical job fairs  engineering recruiters  and engineering temporary staffing firms 
competition comarco wireless competes in a small niche field measurement equipment of the wireless communications marketplace 
the business is competitive and there are other companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources  who provide or could provide the same type of products 
the ability of the company to compete successfully depends upon a number of factors  including the rate at which customers accept the company s products in overseas markets  product quality and performance  experienced sales and marketing personnel  rapid development of new products and features  evolving industry standards  and the number and nature of the company s competitors 
the company believes there are companies that provide or have the ability to provide the products the company is planning for overseas users 
also  companies having a presence or already doing business overseas may have an advantage in knowing how to penetrate those markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future  either domestically or internationally 
proprietary information the company has one patent for its small power adapter for portable computing devices and cellular telephones  and patents covering its emergency callbox product 
however  the company currently relies primarily on a combination of trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks  and contractual rights to protect its intellectual property in the wireless products area 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will be adequate to deter misappropriation or impede third party development of its technology 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products may be sold do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary information could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
outsourced staffing services and other revenue these services are primarily in the fields of o information technologies o intelligent instrumentation and automated test systems o ordnance and weapon systems engineering services o airport management services o commercial staffing services o manufacturing training approximately million or of the company s revenues  and approximately million  or of its operating income  for the fiscal year ended january  were derived from contracts and subcontracts for such services

backlog the company s backlog from outsourced staffing services and other revenue believed to be firm as of january  was million  compared to million as of january  the primary reason for the increase year to year is due to the award of a tps contract by the air force to support the b program  and the award of the riverside county airports contract  as well as the exercise of a two year option extending work on the company s contract at washington national airport until september  the source of backlog is primarily contracts with the us and local governments 
government contracts normally have a base and option periods totalling three to five years in duration 
in many instances  government entities must issue work orders  delivery orders  or task orders prior to the company commencing work 
these entities have the discretion to terminate any contract at their convenience  and are normally obligated only to pay for costs incurred to date under a contract 
in addition  these entities may elect to remove funding previously attached to a contract 
many of the company s contracts are multi year  with options to provide services for additional periods of time 
there can be no assurances that the government entities will exercise the options  will not withdraw funds already committed  nor that the entities will fund the unfunded portions of the company s contracts 
it is estimated that approximately of the firm backlog will be realized in fiscal year government contracts a significant portion of the company s total revenues approximately in fy  in fy  and in fy were derived from contracts with the united states government  principally agencies of the department of defense 
significant portions of the company s revenue are derived from contracts with the us army and us navy  and  respectively 
should changes in procurement policies or reductions in government expenditures occur  revenue and net income of the company could be adversely affected see management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the company s government contracts business is not seasonal  however variations may occur at the expiration of major contracts until such contracts are renewed or new contracts obtained 
in the course of the company s business  its contracts are periodically opened for competition 
none of the company s fiscal year government contracts are scheduled to end in fiscal year the company plans to aggressively compete for its existing work and selectively pursue other high value government procurements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be selected and awarded work under any future proposals 
competition approximately of the company s outsourced staffing services and other revenue business is awarded through competitive procurements 
government contracting services industries consist of thousands of companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources than the company  who can provide the same type of services 
the business is highly competitive 
the company obtains much of its business on the basis of submitted proposals to new and existing customers 
competition generally centers on price  past performance  technical capability  management plan  and personnel 
there is no single company that competes directly with the company on all of the company s services and products 
proprietary information the united states government has certain proprietary rights in software programs and products developed by the company in its performance of government contracts 
employees as of april   the company employed approximately full time employees  of which were part of the outsourced staffing services business area 
in addition  the company has approximately employees working as temporaries in its commercial outsourced staffing business 
the company believes its employee relations to be good 
the majority of the company s employees are professional or technical personnel having training and experience in engineering  computer science  and management 
approximately of the company s employees in this business area are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters and are covered by a collective bargaining agreement

fiscal year revenues totaled million  up from the prior year 
increased year to year revenue is primarily due to o sales of the company s wireless communications products  including various field measurement and revenue assurance systems to major cellular carriers o acquisition as of october  of the cellular callbox product line from gte o acquisition as of august  of a commercial outsourced staffing company partially offset by o reduced revenue levels from government outsourced staffing services  primarily due to the company s contract with the naval air warfare center nawc which ended in the prior fiscal year 
wireless communications products wireless communications products revenues increased to million for fiscal year from million for the comparable period last year 
wireless communication product revenues comprised approximately of total company revenues during fiscal year  up from in the prior fiscal year 
this increase is due to increased sales of the company s network evaluation and revenue assurance systems to major cellular telephone carriers and the acquisition of the callbox product line from gte 
during the year the company continued to broaden its product line with the continued introduction of its second generation of field measurement equipment including products supporting the gsm and cdma air interfaces 
in addition  the company introduced the lt  the latest member of its field measurement product line 
operating income from wireless communications products increased year to year  comprising of the company s total operating income for fiscal year summary operating results for comarco wireless technologies  inc  the company s wireless communications products subsidiary  are as follows january  january  product sales   cost of products sold   gross margin   percentage indirect costs   operating income   indirect costs include selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as research and development expenses 
increased gross margin percentage is due to the incremental benefit of spreading the fixed costs of operations over a larger activity base 
the increase in indirect costs is due to the additional selling and general administrative costs associated with international expansion during fiscal year research and development expense totaled  during fiscal year  compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
the company plans to continue to invest heavily in new product development 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in generating future revenue from such development efforts 
operating income increased to million in fiscal year from million in the prior fiscal year 
operating income as a percentage of revenues is for fiscal year  compared to for the comparable prior period 
the increase is due to the improvement in gross margin percentage noted above  which was partially offset by the increased selling and general administrative expenses 
the company is continuing its software product development program in its wireless communications products business 
in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the company s wireless communications business capitalized and amortized million and million  respectively  during fiscal year the company s wireless communications business capitalized and amortized million and million in fiscal year  respectively 
these amounts are in addition to the research and development expense discussed above 
the company s orders for wireless communications products totaled million for fiscal year  up from million during fiscal year included within the fiscal year booking total is million of long term maintenance service business associated with the purchase of the gte callbox product line 
the value of unfilled orders at january  totaled million  of which million is associated with the long term maintenance contracts 
an additional million of deferred revenue has been recorded for anticipated customer warranty obligations 
in february  the company acquired the callbox product line from cubic communications  inc this acquisition  coupled with the prior acquisition of the gte callbox product line  establishes comarco wireless technologies as one of the leading companies in the callbox niche of the wireless communications industry 
the company has experienced fluctuations in wireless communications products activity in each of the past three years  with greater sales in the second half of its fiscal year and lesser amounts in the first half 
this trend may or may not continue as the company broadens its product offerings 
the nature of the wireless communications products business is inherently unpredictable as the company will normally not have a significant amount of unfilled orders at the end of a period 
therefore  sales levels and profits are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
outsourced staffing services and other revenue revenues provided by the outsourced staffing services business area decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year revenues for outsourced staffing services for fiscal year comprised of the company s total revenues compared with in the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to the completion of the company s contract with the naval air warfare center at china lake  california in the prior year  partially offset by the acquisition of a commercial staffing business as of august  sales to the us government as well as to government prime contractors were and of the company s total revenue during the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended january   respectively 
in the course of the company s business  its government contracts are periodically opened for competition 
during fiscal year  the company announced the award of several contracts with a total estimated value over the lives of the contracts of million to provide engineering and management services to various government agencies 
the majority of these contract awards were recompetition of work the company was already performing 
contract periods are generally three to five years  including options 
none of the company s government contracts are scheduled to end in fiscal year the company plans to aggressively compete for all work opened for competition to the extent possible and selectively pursue certain high value government procurements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be selected and awarded the work associated with any of its future proposals 
in addition  government agencies may terminate their contracts in whole or in part at their convenience 
government agencies may remove funding previously provided or may not exercise option periods 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the government will fund the portions of existing contracts that are unfunded  or that the governmental agencies will exercise any options 
operating income revenues less direct costs  indirect costs  and depreciation and amortization for outsourced staffing services is down year to year from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the reduced operating income is primarily due to the completion of the company s contract with the naval air warfare center at china lake  california in the prior year  partially offset by the contribution from the commercial staffing business acquired as of august  net interest income interest income  less amortization of offering costs and interest expense for fiscal year totaled  compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase is principally due to higher available investable balances year to year 
the company s effective tax rate is for fiscal year versus for the previous fiscal year 
the decreased effective tax rate is due to a reduction in the income tax valuation allowance and an increased level of current tax credits available to offset income taxes on current taxable income 
the overall increase in net income from the prior year is primarily due to the significant increase in sales of wireless communications products at a higher operating income margin  increased investment net earnings  and a lower effective income tax rate 
fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  fiscal year revenues totaled million  up from the prior year 
increased year to year revenue is primarily due to o sales of the company s wireless communications products  including various field measurement and revenue assurance systems to major cellular telephone companies  o increased efforts providing testing of ci systems and field test instrumentation for the us armed forces at various locations  and o increased efforts in support of the naval surface warfare center at crane  indiana  partially offset by o substantial completion as of september   of the company s contract with the naval air warfare center nawc at china lake  california  and o reduction in activity as a subcontractor in support of the army s software development center at ft

wireless communications products wireless communications products revenues increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year wireless communications products revenues comprised approximately of total company revenues during fiscal year  up from in the prior fiscal year 
this increase is due to increased sales of the company s network evaluation and revenue assurance systems to major cellular telephone carriers 
during the year the company continued to broaden its product line with the introduction of its second generation of field measurement equipment  including products supporting the amps  tdma  namps  etacs and gsm air interfaces 
revenues from sales of callboxes were minimal during fiscal year as states other than california have not yet progressed past the field testing stage of these units

the increased gross margin percentage is due to the incremental benefit of spreading the fixed costs of operations over a larger activity base and the ability to obtain economic order buys on component materials 
the increase in indirect costs  excluding research and development expenses  are in line with the increase in revenues 
research and development expense totaled million during fiscal year  compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
the substantial increase year to year is due to a concerted effort by the company in fiscal year  to accelerate the expansion of both its product development program and its efforts to upgrade its existing product line 
the company plans to continue to invest heavily in new product development 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in generating future revenues from such development efforts 
operating income increased to million in fiscal year from million in the prior fiscal year 
operating income as a percentage of revenues is for fiscal year  compared to for the comparable prior period

this trend may or may not continue as the company broadens its product offerings 
the nature of the wireless communications products business is inherently less predictable than the company s traditional government contracting business as the company will normally not have a significant amount of unfilled orders at the end of a period 
therefore  sales levels and profits are more difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
government contracting and other revenue revenues provided by the company s traditional government contracting services business area decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year revenues for government contracting services for fiscal year comprised of the company s total revenues compared with in the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to the reduced activity in the company s contracts with the naval air warfare center at china lake  california and the army s software development center at ft 
lee  virginia 
the china lake contract substantially ended on september  and accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues and approximately of total government contracting revenues during fiscal year and will not generate any revenue in fiscal year this contract also accounted for approximately of the company s total operating income and approximately of total government contracting operating income during fiscal year sales to the us government as well as to government prime contractors were and of the company s total revenue during the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended january   respectively 
in the course of the company s business  its government contracts are periodically opened for competition 
approximately of the company s current government contracting services revenues will either end or will be open for competition during fiscal year the company plans to aggressively compete for all work opened for competition to the extent possible and selectively pursue certain high value government procurements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be selected and awarded the work associated with these outstanding proposals 
in addition  government agencies may terminate their contracts in whole or in part at their convenience 
government agencies may remove funding previously provided or may not exercise option periods 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the government will fund the portions of existing contracts that are unfunded  or that the governmental agencies will exercise any options 
operating income revenues less direct costs  indirect costs  and depreciation and amortization for government contracting services is down year to year from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the reduced operating income is primarily due to the operating loss of million incurred by the company s software products line in fiscal year net interest income interest income  less amortization of offering costs and interest expense for fiscal year totaled  compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase is principally due to the retirement of the company s remaining convertible subordinated debentures and accelerated amortization of offering costs related to the company s purchase of its convertible subordinated debentures during the first quarters of fiscal years and  as well as higher available investable balances year to year
