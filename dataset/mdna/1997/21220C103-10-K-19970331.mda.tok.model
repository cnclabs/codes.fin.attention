item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the financial statements of the company included elsewhere in this report 
general introduction 
kelley accounts for its interests in kelley partners and the ddps using the proportionate consolidation method  combining its share of assets  liabilities  income and expenses of those entities with that of kelley 
in addition to its oil and gas development and producing activities  kelley markets natural gas and operates natural gas gathering and transportation systems in louisiana 
pro forma comparison 
because kelley s historical results for periods prior to the consolidation reflect operations of kelley oil alone  they are not comparable with its operating results after february  which reflect kelley s combined operations following the consolidation 
accordingly  the following discussion of comparative results of operations for the the years ended december  and reflect pro forma information giving effect to the consolidation from the beginning of the company believes this provides a more meaningful comparison of results and operational trends than a comparison based on historical results 
the following table sets forth certain operating data regarding net production  average sales prices  production expenses and revenues associated with kelley s oil and natural gas operations for the periods indicated

general and administrative expenses 


depreciation  depletion and amortization 
impairment of assets 
in the fourth quarter of  the company implemented the financial accounting standards board s statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas 
under fas  certain assets are required to be reviewed periodically for impairment whenever circumstances indicate their carrying amount exceeds their fair value and may not be recoverable 
as a result of its continuing operating losses and a decline in its proved reserves at january   from year earlier pro forma levels  the company performed an assessment of the carrying value of kelley s oil and gas properties indicating an impairment should be recognized as of year end 
under this analysis  the fair value for kelley s proved oil and gas properties was estimated on a depletable unit basis using escalated pricing and present value discount factors reflecting risk assessments 
the fair value of kelley s unproved properties was predicated on current acreage cost estimates 
based on this analysis  kelley recognized noncash impairment charges against the carrying values of its proved and unproved oil and gas properties under fas aggregating million and million  respectively  at december  contour transaction 
in january the company entered into agreements with contour production company llp contour which provided for a two stage equity investment of million in the company by contour 
on february   the first stage of the equity investment was completed through contour s million purchase of newly issued shares of the company s common stock  
par value common stock  representing on such date of the voting shares of the company the contour transaction 
additionally  the company entered into an option agreement the contour option  under which contour has committed to provide the company with million in additional equity financing through an option to purchase million shares the maximum option number of common stock upon satisfaction of certain conditions  including the absence of any company debt repurchase or redemption obligations as a result of the purchase a debt event  but in no event later than january a debt event would occur upon i a change of control as defined in the indenture for the company s senior notes due the notes  ii a change in control as defined in the indenture for the company s convertible subordinated notes due the notes or iii a redemption event as defined in the indenture for the company s convertible subordinated debentures due the debentures 
a debt event with respect to either series of notes or the debentures would entitle each holder of the affected securities to require the repurchase or redemption of the holder s securities 
contour is required to exercise the contour option for the maximum option number within days after it concludes in its sole discretion that a debt event would not occur as a result of the purchase but in no event later than january while the exercise of the contour option would not cause a debt event under the indenture for the debentures  waivers or consents from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes would be required to avoid a debt event 
as is subsequently discussed under the heading debt refinancing  in october the company refinanced substantially all of its notes  thereby eliminating the possibility of a debt event as to these securities 
in connection with the contour transaction  the company also i obtained consents from its principal stockholders to amend its certificate of incorporation to increase its authorized common stock from million shares to million shares  ii entered into employment agreements with john f 
bookout and other new executives elected by the company s board of directors  iii reduced the size of its board to seven members and reconstituted the board with three continuing directors and four designees of contour and iv replaced its credit facility 
proceeds from the contour transaction  after repayment of bank debt  plus funds available under its credit facility have permitted kelley to continue drilling operations and permitted it to pursue acquisition opportunities needed to execute its business strategy for replacing its production and expanding its reserves 
the partnership merger 
in march  kelley partners was merged into the company the partnership merger as part of ongoing efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs 
prior to the partnership merger  kelley partners had outstanding debentures in the aggregate principal amount of million and notes in the aggregate principal amount at maturity of million 
under the terms of the consolidation  the debentures and notes became convertible into the company s common stock or a combination of its common stock and public preferred stock instead of units in kelley partners based on the exchange ratios for the units in the consolidation 
in connection with the partnership merger  the two outstanding subordinated debt issues became direct obligations of the company 
conversion of preferred stock 
in march  the special conversion right for the public preferred stock was triggered by the contour transaction 
under the special conversion right  the conversion price of the public preferred stock was reduced to for a period of days ended april  a total of 
million shares of public preferred stock were tendered pursuant to the special conversion right  resulting in the issuance of million shares of common stock and a reduction in the outstanding public preferred stock to million shares as of december  the company had four outstanding series of esop preferred stock  which ranked junior in dividend and liquidation rights to the public preferred stock 
in june  each of the outstanding million shares of esop preferred stock was redeemed for one share of the company s common stock 
debt refinancing 
pursuant to an offer to purchase and consent solicitation  dated september   as amended  the company offered to purchase for cash up to the aggregate principal amount of million of its notes at a cash price equal to  per  principal amount  plus interest accrued and unpaid through the payment date the tender offer 
in conjunction with the offering  the company also solicited consents to the adoption of certain amendments to the indenture pursuant to which the notes were issued the solicitation  and offered to pay each consenting holder of the notes for each  principal amount of the notes consenting the consent payments 
the company received the requisite consents which allowed it to amend the indenture on october  the company also received tenders from holders of approximately million principal amount of the notes 
on october   the company issued an aggregate principal amount of million of senior subordinated notes due  series a  to its placement agents pursuant to a placement agreement dated october  the company used substantially all of the net proceeds from the offering to pay tendering and consenting holders and associated costs 
the purpose of the refinancing was to improve the company s financial flexibility by i eliminating the covenants applicable to the notes that might impede future financing and acquisition transactions  ii extending the maturities of the company s long term debt and iii replacing senior debt with senior subordinated debt which provides the company flexibility to pursue additional senior debt financings 
on february   the company completed an exchange of million aggregate principal amount of publicly registered senior subordinated notes  series b for all of the then outstanding series a notes 
the series b notes were substantially identical to the series a notes 
fourth quarter extraordinary loss 
in connection with the refinancing of the notes and the payment of consent payments pursuant to the tender offer and the solicitation  the company incurred an extraordinary loss in the fourth quarter of of approximately million  representing the excess of the aggregate purchase price of the notes including consent payments over their carrying value as of the date of the consummation of the refinancing 
hedging activities 
kelley periodically has used forward sales contracts  natural gas swap agreements and options to reduce exposure to downward price fluctuations on its natural gas production 
the swap agreements generally provide for kelley to receive or make counterparty payments on the differential between a fixed price and a variable indexed price for natural gas 
gains and losses realized by kelley from hedging activities are included in oil and gas revenues and average sales prices 
kelley s hedging activities also cover the oil and gas production attributable to the interest in such production of the public unitholders in kelley s subsidiary partnerships 
through a combination of natural gas swap agreements  forward sales contracts and options  approximately of kelley s natural gas production for was affected by kelley s hedging transactions at an average nymex quoted price of per mmbtu before transaction and transportation costs 
approximately of kelley s anticipated natural gas production for the first eight months of has been hedged by natural gas swap agreements at an average nymex quoted price of per mmbtu before transaction and transportation costs 
hedging activities related to swaps and options reduced revenues by approximately million in and increased revenues by approximately million in as compared to estimated revenues had no hedging activities been conducted 
hedging activities were not material in at december   the company had an unrealized loss of million 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company s oil and gas revenues of million for increased compared to million on a pro forma basis last year as a result of increased natural gas prices and a increase in natural gas production to million mcf in the average price of natural gas increased to per mcf in from per mcf in kelley s production of natural gas steadily declined in the second and third quarters of as a result of poor drilling results in south louisiana 
during the fourth quarter of  the company s prior management implemented a significant reduction in drilling activity  which adversely affected production in the first half of the company s current accelerated drilling program increased production substantially in the second half of production of crude oil and natural gas liquids during totaled  barrels with an average sales price of per barrel compared to  barrels at per barrel in pro forma  this represented a volume decrease of and a price increase of 
the decline in oil and condensate volumes reflects the decline in south louisiana gas production 
for  revenues from natural gas marketing and transportation operations  net of associated costs  increased to million from million in production expenses for decreased to million from million in on a pro forma basis  reflecting lower average costs on production from north louisiana  which is increasing in proportion to other higher cost production from south louisiana 
on a unit basis  production expenses decreased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in exploration costs totaled million in and million on a pro forma basis in the corresponding period of  a decrease of primarily reflecting a temporary suspension of exploratory drilling pending negotiation of a joint exploration agreement in south louisiana 
the decrease in these expenses also reflects lower geological and geophysical expenses and unproved leasehold impairment costs 
general and administrative expenses of million in increased compared to million on a pro forma basis in the corresponding period last year 
the increase in expense was primarily attributable to bonuses and interim salaries paid in connection with the contour transaction to certain members of the company s prior management team and a decrease in the level of general and administrative expenses capitalized or charged to exploration expense 
the amounts capitalized or charged were million in compared to million in  or million less in than in on a unit basis  general and administrative expenses increased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in interest and other debt expenses of million in increased from million on a pro forma basis in the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from higher interest rates under the notes than under the million of bank debt refinanced with proceeds from the offering of the notes in june and higher average debt levels during the current period 
interest expense on the notes was recorded for approximately ten months in compared to six months in in october the notes were replaced with the notes 
included in its interest expense  the company recorded noncash charges of million for amortization of debt issuance costs  million for accretion of note discount  million for accretion of debt valuation discount and million in imputed interest associated with the acquisition of oil and gas properties 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a decreased from million on a pro forma basis in to million in despite the increase in production during  primarily as a result of i lower depletion rates following impairment charges aggregating million recognized in the fourth quarter of against the carrying value of kelley s oil and gas properties under fas and ii an increase in quantities of proved developed reserves 
on a unit basis  dd a decreased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in the company s cost cutting measures during included a million restructuring charge in associated primarily with staff reductions and related severance settlements with certain employees and various reorganization costs 
as of december   accounts payable and accrued expenses include upaid restructuring charges of million 
kelley recognized net losses before extraordinary items of million in and million on a pro forma basis in impairment charges aggregating million were recognized in the fourth quarter of the improvement in results was attributable to higher oil and gas prices  increased production and lower depreciation  depletion  amortization  exploration and production costs  partially offset by higher interest expense  reduced capitalization of general and administrative costs and the restructuring charge 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  pro forma oil and gas revenues of million for decreased compared to million in pro forma production of natural gas during increased to million mcf from million mcf in  while the average price of natural gas decreased to per mcf in from per mcf in the prior year 
production of crude oil and natural gas liquids in totaled  barrels  with an average sales price of per barrel compared to  barrels at per barrel in  representing a volume decline of and a price increase of on a pro forma basis 
the decline in oil and gas condensate volumes reflects the decline in liquids rich south louisiana gas production 
the decrease in pro forma oil and gas revenues in was primarily attributable to production declines in the third and fourth quarters  including the loss of production from the divestiture of nonstrategic properties at the beginning of the third quarter and lower natural gas prices 
the prices received for kelley s natural gas production reflect the benefits of swap and option hedging arrangements  which added approximately million to pro forma oil and gas revenues in additionally  kelley realized a gain of million from the sale of nonstrategic properties in july these nonstrategic properties were offered for sale due to their high operating costs and low priority within kelley s development strategy 
kelley received net proceeds of million for the properties  which accounted for approximately of its pro forma proved reserves as of january  the sales affected production levels for the second half of the year 
production expenses for decreased on a pro forma basis to million from million in  primarily reflecting a shift to north louisiana production 
for the same reason  on a unit basis  pro forma production expenses decreased to per mcfe in from per mcfe in the prior year 
pro forma exploration costs totaled million in and million in  an increase of 
the increase in these expenses resulted from higher dry hole and leasehold expiration expenses in south louisiana 
pro forma general and administrative expenses of million in decreased compared to million in  reflecting the benefits of the restructuring implemented at the end of plus ongoing cost containment measures 
in addition  the company incurred one time expenses associated with the consolidation of million during on a unit basis  these expenses decreased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in on a pro forma basis  interest and other debt expenses of million in increased from million in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense resulted partially from higher debt levels and from higher interest rates associated with the issuance of the notes in june in addition to its interest expense  kelley recorded noncash charges in of million for amortization of debt issuance costs  of which million represents prepaid financing costs written off in connection with a related bank debt refinancing 
kelley also recorded noncash charges in for accretion of note discount and accretion of debt valuation discount of million and million  respectively 
dd a decreased on a pro forma basis from million in to million in  generally as a result of lower net capitalized costs in on a unit basis  dd a decreased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in in december  the company implemented a restructuring including staff reductions of approximately to streamline management and administrative functions and reduce general and administrative expenses 
an additional management realignment was implemented in the fourth quarter of nonrecurring charges of million and million primarily related to severance costs were taken in the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
kelley recognized pro forma net losses before income taxes of million in and million in the prior year 
the increased loss primarily reflects noncash impairment charges of million in against the carrying value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties  lower gas prices and higher interest expense and exploration costs  partially offset by lower charges for dd a 
liquidity and capital resources general 
kelley s liquidity is materially affected by cash flows generated from its oil and gas production and has been adversely affected in recent years prior to by unsuccessful drilling results on high risk prospects in south louisiana 
in addition  high interest expense and restrictions under kelley s debt instruments after the consolidation limited kelley s ability to fund drilling projects 
these restrictions required the company to suspend preferred stock dividends and seek a substantial equity infusion in early to avoid a financial covenant default under the credit agreement in effect at that time 
this effort resulted in the contour transaction  completed in february the contour transaction allowed the company to retire its outstanding bank debt  secure a new banking facility and improve its working capital position 
although the contour transaction and the debt refinancings have provided kelley with the means to continue its drilling operations with the objective of increasing its cash flow and reserves  the company had million face amount of debt outstanding as of december   requiring million in annual cash interest payments 
although dividends are generally prohibited under the company s existing credit facility and are restricted under the indenture for the senior subordinated notes the indenture  the outstanding preferred stock is cumulative  requires dividends to accumulate at the rate of million annually and carries liquidation preferences over the common stock totaling million at december   including such dividend arrearages 
the company s existing credit facility permits the company to make a million payment of such dividend arrearages on or prior to may  the indenture also permits the company to make such payment 
the board of directors of the company  however  has not determined whether to make any payments for dividend arrearages at this time  and any such payment must not be prohibited under applicable corporate law 
liquidity 
net cash provided by operating activities  before working capital adjustments  during aggregated million 
the company s cash position was decreased during the year by million primarily as a result of property and equipment expenditures of million and net principal retirements of million on bank borrowings offset by the million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  primarily in the contour transaction  million from the sale of assets and million from the refinancing 
as a result of these activities  cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at december  to million as of december  as of that date  kelley had a working capital deficit of million  compared to a working capital deficit of million at the end of net cash used in operating activities  before working capital adjustments  aggregated million during during the year  the company s cash position was increased through proceeds of million from the issuance of million shares of common stock in an institutional private placement  net proceeds of million from the sale of the notes  proceeds of million from borrowings under its credit facilities  net proceeds of million from the sale of nonstrategic properties  cash of million received in the consolidation and proceeds of million from the exercise of employee stock options 
funds used in investing and financing activities were comprised of property and equipment expenditures of million  principal payments of million on long term borrowings and preferred stock dividends of million 
as a result of these activities  cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at december  to million at december  as of that date  kelley had a working capital deficit of million  as compared to a working capital surplus of million at the end of the following table sets forth on an unaudited basis historical and pro forma net cash provided by used in operating activities before working capital adjustments  net cash used in investing activities and ebitdax 
in thousands year ended december  pro forma pro forma net cash provided by used in operating activities before working capital adjustments      net cash used in investing activities      ebitdax      ebitdax is calculated as net income loss before extraordinary itmes  excluding interest expense and other debt expenses  income taxes  exploration costs  restructuring expense  depletion  depreciation  amortization  and impairment of oil and gas properties 
ebitdax is not a measure of cash flow as determined by gaap 
the company has included information concerning ebitdax because ebitdax is a measure used by certain investors in determining a company s historical ability to service its indebtedness 
ebitdax should not be considered as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net income or cash flow as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of kelley s operating performance or liquidity 
ebitdax is not necessarily comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company 
new credit facility 
the company replaced its previous credit facility with its existing credit facility the new credit facility effective as of december  the borrowers under the new credit facility are the company  kelley oil corporation kelley oil and kelley operating company  ltd 
kelley operating  with concorde gas marketing  inc a subsidiary of the company and the company s subsidiary partnerships as guarantors 
the new credit facility provides for a maximum million revolving credit loan and matures  with all amounts owed thereunder becoming due and payable  effective december  borrowings under the new credit facility are subject to a borrowing base to be determined semi annually by the lenders based in part on the proved oil and gas reserves and other assets of kelley which may be redetermined more frequently at the election of the lenders or the borrowers 
initially  the borrowing base is million 
to the extent that the borrowing base is less than the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding loans and letters of credit under the new credit facility  of such deficiency must be cured within days and the balance must be cured within the next days unless such deficiency is a result of an asset sale  in which case the deficiency must be cured on the date the borrowing base is re determined as a result of such sale 
borrowings under the new credit facility are secured by substantially all of the oil and gas assets of the company and its subsidiaries and the proceeds therefrom 
so long as no default or event of default as defined in the new credit facility is continuing  borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest  at the option of the borrowers  at either i libor plus to depending on the level of utilization of the borrowing base or ii the higher of a the agent s prime rate and b the federal funds rate plus 
the borrowers incur a quarterly commitment fee ranging from to per annum on the average unused portion of the borrowing base  depending upon the level of utilization 
the new credit facility contains covenants which  among other things  limit the amount of debt kelley may incur  limit the placement of liens on kelley s assets  limit lease transactions  limit kelley s ability to enter into certain hedging transactions  restrict the ability of the company or any of its subsidiaries to merge with or into another person and prevent the company from prepaying certain subordinated indebtedness unless certain conditions are met 
further  covenants require that  for specified periods  the company maintain specified ratios between ebitdax and senior indebtedness and ebitdax and interest on indebtedness 
the new credit facility also prohibits the payment of dividends  except that it permits the payment on or prior to may  of million on dividend arrearages on the outstanding preferred stock 
in the event such payment is not made  the preferred stockholders will be entitled to elect two additional members to the company s board of directors 
contour 
pursuant to the second stage of contour s equity investment in the company  contour has committed to provide an additional million in equity financing upon satisfaction of certain conditions  including the absence of any company debt repurchase or redemption obligations  but in no event later than january while exercise of such commitment cannot be assured prior to january  any proceeds received pursuant to such commitment will reduce kelley s dependence on outside financing to support subsequent drilling and acquisition activities 
see general contour transaction above 
capital commitments 
in february  the development drilling program the ddp completed a public offering of million units at per unit on a preemptive basis to public unitholders in kelley partners 
kelley oil s subscription commitment to the ddp  after return of capital  aggregated million or of the ddp s total 
as of december   kelley oil had contributed million to the ddp  together with interest at a market rate on the portion of its commitment that remained outstanding after november kelley oil intends to contribute the unfunded portion of its commitment  which totaled million at december   together with interest  as funds are needed for completion of the ddp s drilling program 
kelley oil is the primary beneficiary of these commitments as a result of its ownership in the ddp  while approximately million can be attributable to the public unitholders interests in the ddp 
during  kelley s capital expenditures are expected to continue to be focused on development drilling in north louisiana  where kelley currently expects to expend over million on drilling and completion of wells  subject to regulatory and third party consents 
in addition  kelley plans to balance its drilling strategy by pursuing acquisition opportunities to expand its reserve base and operating areas  while utilizing its joint venture with williams to explore and develop its higher potential exploratory prospects in south louisiana at minimal cost to kelley 
kelley has an active program for ongoing evaluation of opportunities meeting its acquisition criteria 
there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition candidates will be available to the company on terms it deems reasonable or that any completed acquisition will ultimately prove to be a successful undertaking by the company 
the company anticipates that  except for any significant property acquisitions  business combinations or development required by exploratory success and subject to price stability  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under the new credit facility will be adequate to fund kelley s debt service obligations  expected capital expenditure requirements and working capital needs 
to fully realize kelley s objectives for property development and acquisitions  however  the company may be required to pursue additional financing alternatives 
stock based compensation 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  effective for the company on january  fas permits  but does not require  a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock option plans  resulting in compensation expense being recognized in the results of operations when stock options are granted 
the company has not elected and does not expect to elect to follow the fair value based method of accounting for stock option plans  and therefore  no compensation expense is or will be recognized 
however  as required by fas  the company will provide pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share in the notes to its consolidated financial statements as if the fair value based method of accounting had been applied 
inflation and changing prices 
oil and natural gas prices  as with most commodities  are highly volatile  have fluctuated during recent years and generally have not followed the same pattern as inflation 
the following table shows the changes in the average oil and gas prices received by kelley oil during the periods indicated 
average average oil price gas price bbl mcf year ended december  december  pro forma december  pro forma forward looking statements from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  relating to matters such as anticipated operating and financial performance  business prospects  developments and results of the company 
actual performance  prospects  developments and results may differ materially from any or all anticipated results due to economic conditions and other risks  uncertainties and circumstances partly or totally outside the control of the company  including rates of inflation  natural gas prices  reserve estimates  rates and timing of future production of oil and gas  and changes in the level and timing of future costs and expenses related to drilling and operating activities 
words such as anticipated  expert  estimate  project and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements may be made in management s statements orally or in writing including press releases  and in filings of the sec  including this report 
in addition to uncertainties in estimating reserves and other such factors mentioned in this report  the following additional risk factors should be considered leverage 
as of december   the company had million face amount of debt outstanding and stockholders deficit of approximately million 
the company expects to incur additional indebtedness for future borrowings under its credit facility as it continues its strategy for acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
the company s ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest on or to refinance its indebtedness for money borrowed depends on its future performance and successful implementation of its strategy  which is subject not only to its own actions but also to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond its control  as well as to the prevailing market prices for oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
depletion of reserves  necessity of successful exploration and development 
producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors 
kelley s future oil and natural gas reserves and production  and  therefore  cash flow and income  are highly dependent upon kelley s success in efficiently developing its current reserves and acquiring additional reserves that are economically recoverable 
volatility of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices 
kelley s financial results are affected significantly by the prices received for its oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids production 
historically  the markets for oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids have been volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices received by kelley for its oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids production and the levels of such production are subject to government regulation  legislation and policies 
kelley s future financial condition and results of operations will depend  in part  upon the prices received for kelley s oil and natural gas production  as well as the costs of finding  acquiring  developing and producing reserves 
operating hazards and uninsured risks 
oil and gas drilling activities are subject to numerous risks  many of which are uninsurable  including the risk that no commercially viable oil or natural gas production will be obtained  many of such risks are beyond kelley s control 
the decision to purchase  explore or develop a prospect or property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain  and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical 
technical problems encountered in actual drilling  completion and workover activities can delay such activity and add substantial costs to a project 
further  drilling may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of many factors  including title problems  weather conditions  compliance with government permitting requirements  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment  reductions in product prices and limitations in the market for products 
at present  the level of drilling activity in the united states has resulted in increased demand for  and therefore increased costs associated with  drilling equipment and the services and products of other vendors to the industry 
in particular  in connection with drilling activities in the marshy regions of south louisiana  there has been an increased cost of drilling operations due to increased costs for barge rigs necessary to conduct activity in such region 
moreover  the number of drilling contractors offering barge drilling and workover services is limited 
the availability of a ready market for kelley s oil and natural gas production also depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines or trucking and terminal facilities 
natural gas wells may be shut in for lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of natural gas pipeline or gathering system capacity 
kelley s oil and natural gas business also is subject to all of the operating risks associated with the drilling for and production of oil and natural gas  including  but not limited to  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine or well fluids into the environment including groundwater and shoreline contamination  blowouts  cratering  mechanical difficulties  fires  explosions  pollution and other risks  any of which could result in substantial losses to kelley 
although kelley maintains insurance at levels that it believes are consistent with industry practices  it is not fully insured against all risks 
losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operations of kelley
