effects of inflation management does not believe that changes in replacement costs of fixed assets will materially affect the company s operations 
the rate of inflation  however  affects the company s expenses  such as employee compensation  rent and communications 
increases in these expenses may not be readily recoverable in the price the company charges for its services 
inflation can have significant effects on interest rates which  in turn  can affect prices and activities in the securities markets 
these fluctuations may have an adverse impact on the company s operations
