the manufacturing segment represented of ebitda or million  an increase of million versus the full year inclusion of central products whose ebitda contribution was million in versus million in accounted for million of the increase 
this increase was offset by lower ebitda at lynch machinery of million when compared to results due to lower sales volume of the extra large glass presses 
the services segment had negative ebitda of million versus million in the decline was attributable to a a million loss reserve taken by morgan relating to the closing of the truckaway division and related real estate and b a decrease in recreational vehicle margins due to reduced demand and higher driver pay and insurance claims 
the multimedia segment contributed million or of total ebitda versus million in operating profits for were million in  a decrease of million or versus operating profits in the services segment declined by million due to the same factors impacting ebitda 
this decline was partially offset by improvements in the manufacturing  multimedia and corporate segments of million  million and 
million  respectively 
investment income decreased by 
million to million in versus the decrease was related to lower dollar investments in generating current income 
interest expense increased by million in when compared to the increase is due primarily to the full year effect of financing the acquisition of cpc in late gain on sales of subsidiary and affiliate stock increased by million in this increase is the result of the conversion of a million spinnaker note into spinnaker common stock in and other transactions

million in versus

acquisitions made during and  principally in the manufacturing segment  were the most significant contributors to the increase 
in the manufacturing segment  where revenues increased by million to million in from million in  or 
the acquisition of brown bridge industries  inc on september   contributed million in revenues for versus million in this represents of the total manufacturing increase 
the acquisition of central products company on october   contributed million  or of the segment s revenues increase 
s manufacturing revenues also reflect million from lynch machinery  inc compared to million in  of the segment s revenue increase 
the production of extra large glass presses from orders contracted for in and resulted in this additional revenue 
fifteen glass presses were shipped in  compared to eight in of the presses shipped in  eleven were advanced technology extra large presses 
as a result of the shipment of these presses in  lynch machinery glass press backlog was reduced by million to million at december  from million at december  while lynch machinery is in the process of bidding for additional glass press contracts  it is not anticipated that the level of production in will equal levels 
the services segment  which represents of total revenue  increased by million from or 
the morgan group  inc s results increased due to continued strength in manufactured housing shipments industry shipments up and the acquisition of transfer drivers  inc in may in the multimedia segment  which represents of total revenue  revenues increased by million from  or

operating segment ebitda prior to corporate management fees and expenses grew to million from million  a increase 
the manufacturing segment was the largest contributor to ebitda with million  or in  as compared to million  or in spinnaker s ebitda grew to million from million  a million increase 
the inclusion of brown bridge for the full year accounted for million of the increase in central products ebitda of million in the fourth quarter primarily accounted for the remaining increase 
lynch machinery accounted for of the total increase in manufacturing ebitda 
profit margins associated with the production of extra large glass were the cause of the significant improvement 
the services segment contributed million  or  compared to million  or in this increase was directly the result of the increased revenues offset by a product mix shift and increases in certain operating costs

the inclusion of central products for the full year plus additional acquisitions made in and anticipated to close in are projected to increase reported ebitda by about in from operating profits increased to million in from million in  million or increase 
the breakdown of the increases and the primary causes are the same as the above discussion regarding ebitda 
investment income increased in from primarily reflecting additional net gains in marketable securities 
interest expense increased during primarily as a result of the debt incurred for acquisition needs in and for central products and brown bridge 
the full year effect of the financing for the central products acquisition is expected to significantly increase interest expense

this loss was  or per share 
financial condition as of december   the registrant had current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
working capital was therefore million as compared to million at december   primarily due to the decline in current maturities of long term debt as a result of the high yield offering at spinnaker industries and acquisitions made during within the elements of current assets  cash and cash equivalents increased by million  primarily due to the sale of marketable securities and short term investments of million  inclusion of dunkirk and fredonia million and an increase of approximately million at spinnaker due to changes in working capital demands offset by a reduction of million at lynch machinery see consolidated statement of cash flow for additional elements 
inventories increased by million primarily due to increases at central products and brown bridge 
within current liabilities  notes due to banks increased by million  primarily due to borrowing under the holding company s line of credit 
cash flow from operations as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flow increased by million  primarily due to increased ebitda from the company s operating entities  and net sales of trading securities offset by an increase in other net working capital components 
capital expenditures were million in and million in due to significant deployment of enhanced technology by our telephone operations  installation of the silicone paper coating machine at brown bridge and the inclusion of central products for the full year in this increased level of capital expenditures is expected to decline in in the multimedia segment as upgrade programs wind down and absence of large machine investments in manufacturing 
overall capital expenditures are expected to be approximately below the level 
at december   total debt was million  which was million more than the million at the end of total debt was significantly impacted by the acquisition of dunkirk and fredonia telephone company  with a total of million of debt incurred and assumed and registrant s investment in pcs partnerships of million  with the remainder attributable principally to spinnaker 
debt at year end included million of fixed interest rate debt  at an average cash interest rate of and million of variable interest rate debt at an average interest rate of 
additionally  the company had million in unused short term lines of credit of which million was attributed to spinnaker  and million of which was attributable to morgan 
as of december   the parent company borrowed million under a million short term line of credit facility 
these funds were primarily used to fund the bids by affiliated partnerships in the pcs auctions 
this short term line of credit expires april  management anticipates that this line will be renewed for one year but there is no assurance that it will be 
backlog in the manufactured products segment at december  was million versus million at the end of backlog at lynch machinery was million at december   and million at december  the lack of significant orders coupled with the elimination of product lines caused the decrease 
orders of million were booked in early  somewhat compensating for the decline in backlog at brown bridge declined by million in to million at december  backlog at central products increased by million in to million at december  since  the board of directors of lynch has authorized the repurchase of  common shares 
at december   lynch s remaining authorization is to repurchase an additional  shares of common stock 
the board of directors has adopted a policy not to pay dividends  and such policy is reviewed annually 
this policy takes into account the long term growth objectives of the company  especially its acquisition program  shareholders desire for capital appreciation of their holdings and the current tax law disincentives for corporate dividend distributions 
accordingly  no cash dividends have been paid since january  and none are expected to be paid in lynch corporation maintains an active acquisition program and generally finances each acquisition with a significant component of debt 
this acquisition debt contains restrictions on the amount of readily available funds that can be transferred to lynch corporation from its subsidiaries 
registrant has a minority position in several entities to which it has funding commitments 
these entities participated in two of the auctions conducted by the federal communications commission for megahertz and megahertz of broadband spectrum to be used for personal communications services  the so called c and f block auction  respectively 
in the c block auction  such entities acquired licenses to provide personal communications services to geographic areas of the united states with a total population of million 
the cost of these licenses was million  million of the cost of these licenses was funded via a loan from the united states government 
the loan requires quarterly interest payments at registrant argues strenuously that the interest rate should have been  the applicable treasury rate at the time the licenses were awarded  and with quarterly principal amortization in years    and as of december   registrant invested  in partnership equity and million in loans and has funding commitments to provide an additional million in loans  including funding quarterly interest on the government debt of million 
in the f block auction  an entity in which lynch holds a minority position acquired five licenses to provide personal communications services in geographic areas of the united states with a total populations of million 
the cost of these licenses was million 
of the cost of the licenses will be financed with a loan from the united states government 
the interest rate on the loan will be the long term government rate at the date of issuance and with quarterly principal amortization in years to as of december  registrant has invested  in partnership equity and provided the entity with a loan of million funded by a short term secured borrowing by the registrant 
million of this loan was returned in january  however  registrant continues to have a funding commitment to provide million in loans to the entity 
registrant is currently seeking alternatives to minimize or raise funds for its funding commitments to the entities  but currently expects to fund required interest payments 
there are many risks associated with personal communications services 
in addition  funding aspects of acquisition of licenses and the subsequent mandatory build out requirements plus the amortization of the license  could significantly and materially impact the registrant s reported net income over the next several years 
of note  under the current structure the ramifications of this should not impact reported revenues and ebitda in the future 
in mid march  registrant acquired of the stock of upper peninsula telephone company for approximately million with a short term secured bridge financing 
registrant is currently seeking permanent financing to replace the bridge financing and to finance the acquisition of the remaining stock of upper peninsula 
in december   the registrant s board of directors announced that it is examining the possibility of splitting  through a spin off  either its communications operations or its manufacturing operations 
a spin off could improve management focus  facilitate and enhance financings and set the stage for future growth  including acquisitions 
a split could also help surface the underlying values of the company as the different business segments appeal to differing value and growth cultures in the investment community 
there are a number of matters to be examined in connection with a possible spin off  including tax consequences  and there is no assurance that such a spin off will be effected 
lynch corporation has a significant need for resources to fund the operation of the holding company  and meet its current funding commitments  including those related to personal communications services  and fund future growth 
lynch is currently considering various alternative long and short term financing arrangements 
one such alternative would be to sell a portion or all of certain investment in operating entities 
additional debt and or equity financing vehicles are also being considered 
while management expects to obtain adequate financing resources to enable the company to meet its obligations  there is no assurance that such can be readily obtained or at reasonable costs
