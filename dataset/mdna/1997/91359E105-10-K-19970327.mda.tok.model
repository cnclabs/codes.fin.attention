general the matters discussed in this report as well as the news releases issued from time to time by the trust contain certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including the fact that a substantial portion of the trust s revenues are dependent on one operator  universal health services  inc  and that a substantial portion of the trust s leases and mortgagors are involved in the healthcare industry which is undergoing substantial changes and is subject to pressure from government reimbursement programs and other third party payors 
in recent years  an increasing number of legislative initiatives have been introduced or proposed in congress and in state legislatures that would effect major changes in the healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
in addition  the healthcare industry has been characterized in recent years by increased competition and consolidation 
management of the trust is unable to predict the effect  if any  these industry factors will have on the operating results of its lessees  including the facilities leased to subsidiaries of uhs  or on their ability to meet their obligations under the terms of their leases with the trust 
in addition  certain of the trust s facilities leased to subsidiaries of uhs have had ebitdar of less than times the rent payable to the trust 
see note 
management of the trust can not predict whether the leases with subsidiaries of uhs  which have renewal options at existing lease rates  or any of the trust s other leases  will be renewed at the end of their initial lease terms 
if the leases are not renewed at their current rates  the trust would be required to find other operators for those facilities and or enter into leases on terms potentially less favorable to the trust than the current leases 
results of operations total revenues increased or million to million in as compared to and or million to million in as compared to the million increase during over was primarily attributable to an increase in base rentals from non related parties due to the various acquisitions made by the trust during the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of see note 
the million increase during as compared to was attributable to i a  increase in base rental from uhs facilities resulting from the purchase by the trust of additional real estate assets related to mcallen medical center and additional base rental generated from the westlake medical center swap transaction see note  ii a million increase in base rental from non related parties resulting from the acquisitions of office buildings in november of and the third and fourth quarters of see note  iii a  increase in bonus rentals  which are computed as a percentage of each facility s revenue in excess of base year amounts or cpi increases in excess of base year amounts  and  iv a  increase in interest income 
the average occupancy rate of a hospital is affected by a number of factors  including the number of physicians using the hospital  changes in the number of beds  the composition and size of the population of the community in which the hospital is located  general and local economic conditions  variations in local medical and surgical practices and the degree of outpatient use of the hospital services 
current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors 
a continuation of such industry trends could have a material adverse impact upon the future operating performance of the trust s facilities 
the trust s facilities have experienced growth in outpatient utilization over the past several years 
the increase is primarily the result of advances in medical technologies  which allow more services be provided on an outpatient basis  and increased pressure from medicare  medicaid  health maintenance organizations hmos  preferred provider organizations ppos and insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services  where possible  on a less expensive outpatient basis 
the trust expects growth in outpatient services to continue  although the rate of growth may be moderated in the future 
an increased proportion of the trust s hospitals revenue is derived from fixed payment services  including medicare and medicaid 
management of the trust s hospitals expects the medicare and medicaid revenues to continue to increase as a larger portion of the general population qualifies for coverage as a result of the aging population and expansion of the state medicaid programs 
the medicare program reimburses the trust s hospitals primarily based on established rates by a diagnosis related group for acute care hospitals and by a cost based formula for behavioral health facilities 
in addition to the medicare and medicaid programs  other payors continue to actively negotiate the amounts they will pay for services performed 
in general  management of the trust s hospitals expects the percentage of its business from managed care programs  including hmos and ppos to grow 
the consequent growth in managed networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of the trust s facilities vary among the market in which the trust s facilities operate 
management of the trust is unable to predict the rate of growth of the net revenues of its facilities and the resulting impact on bonus revenues  which are computed as a percentage of each facility s net revenues in excess of base year amounts or cpi increases in excess of base year amounts  because the net revenues of the trust s facilities are dependent upon developments in medical technologies and physician practice patterns  both of which are beyond the control of management of the facilities 
in addition to the trends described above that continue to have an impact on the revenues of the trust s facilities  there are a number of other  more general factors affecting the trust s facilities 
in february  the president submitted his fiscal year budget plan which calls for a billion reduction in the rate of increase in medicare spending over the next five years and a billion reduction over six years 
included in this proposal are reductions in the future rate of increases to payments made to hospitals 
both republicans and democrats are working towards a balanced budget by the year and it is likely that future budgets will contain certain reductions in the rate of increase of medicare and medicaid spending 
the trust cannot predict whether the above proposal or any other proposals will be adopted  and if adopted  no assurance can be given that the implementation of such plans will not have a material adverse effect on the operating results of the trust s facilities 
interest expense increased  or in as compared to due primarily to the additional borrowings used to finance the purchase of equity interests in various limited liability corporations and limited partnerships during the first and second quarters of  the purchase of the four preschool and child care centers during the second quarter of  and the medical office buildings acquired by the trust during the third and fourth quarters of see note 
interest expense increased  or in over due primarily to the increased borrowings used to finance the purchase of the medical office buildings in kingwood  texas and shreveport  louisiana and the purchase of an additional million of real assets related to mcallen medical center 
also contributing to the increased interest expense in as compared to was the million of additional borrowings used to finance the purchase of the fresno herndon medical plaza in november of depreciation and amortization expense increased  or in as compared to due primarily to the depreciation expense related to the and acquisitions described in note depreciation and amortization expense increased  or in as compared to due to i a  increase in depreciation expense related primarily to the purchase of the medical office buildings and additional real estate assets purchased in  as mentioned above  and a full year of depreciation expense recorded on the fresno herndon mob which was purchased by the trust in december of  and  ii an  decrease in amortization of financing costs related to the old revolving credit agreement 
other operating expenses increased  or in as compared to due primarily to the expenses related to the medical office buildings acquired by the trust during the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of and a  increase in the reserve established for future expenses related to the settlement of lake shore hospital 
as of december   the balance in the lake shore hospital reserve account was  the expenses related to the medical office buildings  which totaled  in and  in  are passed on directly to the tenants and are included as revenue in the trust s statements of income 
other operating expenses increased  or in as compared to due primarily to the expenses related to the fresno herndon medical plaza which was acquired by the trust in november of included in the financial results for  and recorded as recovery of investment losses was  consisting of million of cash payments received related to the lake shore hospital settlement agreement and  of proceeds received during related to an investment in marketable equity securities which was written down to zero in a prior year 
partially offsetting these amounts was a  increase in the reserve established for future expenses related to the settlement of lake shore hospital 
net income for was million or per share compared to million or per share in and million or per share in funds from operations ffo  which is the sum of net income plus depreciation expense and amortization of interest rate cap expense  totaled million in  million in and million in ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the trust s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity
