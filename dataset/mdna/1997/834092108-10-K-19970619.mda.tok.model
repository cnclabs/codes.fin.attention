the ao acquisition  with nine months of ao net sales  amounting to million  included in fiscal net sales  has had a significant impact on the net sales growth from fiscal to fiscal in addition  higher priced product growth has also contributed to the company s net sales growth from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal  led by the growth of spectralite r and plastic photochromic products  offset in part by price and volume erosion in net sales of lower priced products 
higher priced products accounted for approximately of net lens sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal plastic photochromic lenses were first introduced in the united states in fiscal  and launched in europe  australia and south america in fiscal increased marketing and customer service efforts also contributed to the growth in other higher priced products

the gross profit as a percentage of net sales has decreased in fiscal  as ao traditionally operates at lower gross margins than sola on a standalone basis 
in addition  the company has incurred manufacturing start up costs in its new finished polycarbonate manufacturing operation acquired when the company purchased neolens inc in july  and ramp up costs associated with new product offerings 
offsetting in part the aforementioned reductions  has been a continued shift towards higher value added products  and continued benefits from the company s cost reduction program 
during fiscal the company benefited from reduced manufacturing costs at its mexican facility arising from the weakness of the mexican peso  and from the company s cost reduction program 
in addition  improved sales mix and manufacturing improvements  offset in part by cost inflation in south america  contributed to the improved gross profit as a percentage of sales from fiscal to fiscal the company continues to experience price competition  which can be severe in certain markets  particularly for standard products

because research and development expenditure in ao as a percentage of net sales is lower than that of sola on a standalone basis  a reduced ratio of research and development expenses to net sales can be expected for the combined company in the future

selling and marketing expenses were  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company introduced a new progressive lens design  percepta r  with a worldwide launch 
significant marketing expenditures associated with this launch were incurred primarily in the last two quarters of the fiscal year 
the main reasons for the percentage decrease in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal over fiscal were savings achieved from lower distribution costs  primarily in north america  which caused selling and marketing expenses to grow at a slower rate than net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the lower percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to lower performance based management bonuses in fiscal and favorable foreign currency gains 
in addition  the provisions for doubtful accounts in south america and asia were significantly lower in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in administrative expenses in fiscal over fiscal includes reductions in performance based management bonuses offset by an increase in provisions for doubtful accounts reflecting the lengthening days sales outstanding in parts of south america and asia

the utilization of the united states valuation allowance has resulted in a reduced effective tax rate for fiscal  and the net operating losses in australia  which do not expire  are expected to exceed taxable profits in australia in fiscal the valuation allowances provided against united states deferred tax assets have been fully reversed as of march   and therefore the company expects its effective tax rate to increase in fiscal and beyond

the growth in inventory levels has resulted from the introduction and regional spread of new products  resulting in both finished goods inventory growth and increased mold inventory requirements

currency exchange rates as a result of the company s worldwide operations  currency exchange rate fluctuations tend to affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
the two principal effects of currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations and financial position are i translation adjustments for subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency and ii translation adjustments for subsidiaries in hyper inflationary countries 
translation adjustments for functional local currencies have been made to shareholders equity 
for the fiscal years ended march   and such translation adjustments were approximately million  million  million  respectively 
during fiscal the company benefited from reduced manufacturing costs at its mexican facility arising from the weakness of the mexican peso 
for translation adjustments of the company s subsidiaries operating in hyper inflationary countries  until recently primarily brazil  the functional currency is determined to be the us dollar  and therefore all translation adjustments are reflected in the company s statements of operations 
commencing with the fourth quarter of fiscal the company s operations in mexico have been accounted for as hyper inflationary economies 
in hyper inflationary environments  the company generally protects margins by methods which include increasing prices monthly at a rate appropriate to cover anticipated inflation  compounding interest charges on sales invoices daily and holding cash balances in us dollar denominated accounts where possible 
because a majority of the company s debt is us dollar denominated  the company may hedge against certain currency fluctuations by entering into currency swaps however certain currencies  such as the brazilian real  cannot be hedged  although no such swaps had been entered into as of march  as of march  certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries had entered into forward contracts for intercompany purchase commitments in amounts other than their home currency 
the carrying amount of the forward contracts approximates fair value  which has been estimated based on current exchange rates 
for further financial data of the company s performance by region  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality the company s business is somewhat seasonal  with third quarter results generally weaker than the other three quarters as a result of lower sales during the holiday season  and fourth quarter results generally the strongest 
inflation inflation continues to affect the cost of the goods and services used by the company 
the competitive environment in many markets limits the company s ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices  and the company is subject to price erosion in many of its standard product lines 
the company seeks to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and productivity and manufacturing process improvements 
approximately of the company s net sales during fiscal were derived from its operations in south america  the majority of which are in brazil  which has experienced periods of hyper inflation 
in june  the brazilian government introduced a new currency  the real  and adopted certain financial plans to reduce inflation in that country 
from june through march   inflation has reduced to approximately per month 
for a description of the effects of inflation on the company s reported revenues and profits and the measures taken by the company in response to inflationary conditions  see currency exchange rates above
