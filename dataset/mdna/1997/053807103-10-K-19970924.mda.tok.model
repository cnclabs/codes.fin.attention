item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  and other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
reference herein to any particular year or quarter generally refers to the company s fiscal calendar 
the company operates primarily in one industry segment through its electronic marketing group  which distributes electronic components and computer products 
the electronic marketing group accounted for  and of avnet s consolidated sales in   and  respectively  and  and of consolidated net income during those respective periods 
therefore  due to the dominance of the electronic marketing group and the immaterial size of the video communications group and the electrical and industrial group which was eliminated at the beginning of the fiscal year as described below  this discussion and analysis section will focus primarily on consolidated information 
the company has indicated its desire to dispose of its channel master business  the sole remaining operation in the video communications group 
as a result of the immaterial size of the video communications group as noted above  in the event the company does dispose of its channel master business  the impact on the company s financial condition  liquidity and results of operations will not be material 
the electronic marketing group can be segmented into two major types of businesses  the distribution of electronic components and the distribution of computer products 
the electronic components business  which is comprised of three subgroups and a number of operating units in north america  europe  asia pacific and africa  sells or provides other value added services related to electronic component products including  but not limited to  semiconductors  microprocessors  connectors and passive and electromechanical devices 
the computer products business is comprised of one subgroup which consists of two operating units with locations in north america and europe 
the four subgroups of the electronic marketing group are known as the original equipment manufacturer marketing group omg  the computer marketing group cmg  the industrial marketing group img and avnet emg international 
the omg  img and avnet emg international business units make up the electronic components part of the business  and cmg represents the computer products business 
the omg consists of hamilton hallmark including hamilton hallmark technologies  time electronics including avnet cable technologies and penstock including sertek 
the img is comprised of allied electronics and avnet industrial  and avnet emg international includes all of the electronic marketing group s electronic components operations outside of north america 
the cmg consists of avnet computer and hall mark computer products 
the business of each of these operations is discussed elsewhere in this report 
during the first quarter of  the company completed the sale of the motor  motor repair shop and oem business of brownell electro 
avnet industrial  the remaining business of brownell which serves the industrial marketplace primarily in mro  together with allied electronics  now make up the img 
the results for brownell prior to the sale described above which were not material  including the business that was sold  were included in the electronic marketing group s results in the first quarter of the company s electrical and industrial group was  therefore  eliminated as a business segment as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
results of operations consolidated sales were a record billion in  or higher than the billion in this increase was due to increased sales at each operating unit in the electronic marketing group s north american operations  including significantly higher sales at the cmg  offset somewhat by lower sales at avnet emg international 
the electronic marketing group s sales in were billion  up as compared with billion in  and the video communications group s sales in were million  or lower than the prior year s sales of million 
all of the companies within emg north america the omg  the cmg and the img posted record fiscal year sales in  except for avnet industrial as described below 
sales of the omg and the cmg were up and  respectively  as compared with  while sales at emg international were down 
although sales of the img were down  this was due to the disposition in of the group s brownell business  whose sales were included in the img s results in sales at the img s allied electronics operation were up over the prior year 
consolidated sales were billion in  or higher than the billion in this increase was due to strong sales growth at each operating unit in the electronic marketing group  offset somewhat by lower sales in the video communications group 
the electronic marketing group s sales in were billion  up as compared with billion in  and the video communications group s sales in were million  or lower than the prior year s sales of million 
of the million increase in consolidated sales  approximately million was contributed by operations acquired during without such sales  consolidated sales would have been approximately higher than in each of the operating units in the electronic marketing group posted double digit sales increases in as compared with sales of hamilton hallmark  penstock  the computer marketing group  time electronics and allied were up    and  respectively  in as compared with sales of avnet emg international were up in as compared with and were in excess of billion 
excluding the sales contributed by operations acquired during  avnet emg international s sales would have been approximately higher than in in  sales of semiconductors  computer products  connectors and other products principally passives and electromechanical devices  represented   and  respectively  of the electronic marketing group s sales as compared with   and  respectively  in consolidated gross profit margins were in as compared with and in and  respectively 
this downward trend is due primarily to the competitive environment in the electronic distribution marketplace and to increased sales of computer products  which have lower gross margins than other products in the company s product line 
although operating expenses in absolute dollars were sequentially higher during the last three years  they decreased as a percentage of sales over that time span 
the company reduced operating expenses as a percentage of sales to in as compared with and in and  respectively 
as a result  operating income of million in represented of sales  as compared with million or of sales in and million or of sales in other income  which has had no material impact on earnings since the company liquidated its marketable securities portfolio to partially fund the july  acquisition of hall mark electronics  was million in as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
other income in included the third quarter million gain on the sale of the company s former culver city  california facility 
interest expense was million in  as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the million increase in interest expense in as compared with was due to a combination of factors 
interest expense in was positively affected by the reversal of million of interest expense which was accrued at june  with respect to the company s convertible subordinated debentures due the debentures as discussed more fully below 
the balance of the change in interest expense  a decrease of million  was due primarily to a lower effective interest rate as average debt outstanding was about the same in both years 
in  average debt outstanding was approximately higher than in  however  interest expense was only higher due to a combination of a lower effective interest rate and the impact of the reversal in of interest expense which was accrued at june  with respect to the debentures 
following the company s call for redemption of the debentures see below  almost of the outstanding debentures were converted into common stock of the company in september  thereby eliminating the requirement to pay interest on the debentures subsequent to the interest payment made on april  and necessitating the reversal of interest accrued at june  as a result of factors described above  net income in was million  about lower than the record earnings of million achieved in  but substantially higher than the million of net income in net income as a percentage of sales was in as compared with and in and  respectively 
although net income in dollars was down in as compared with  as described above  earnings per share of was down only as compared with in  due to the impact of the company s stock buyback program see discussion in liquidity and capital resources section below 
the electronic marketing group s net income in was million  slightly less than the record net income of million achieved in  and significantly higher than the group s net income in of million 
the electronic marketing group s net profit margins were  and in  and  respectively 
due to the impact of the company s stock buyback program  the electronic marketing group s contribution to earnings per share was a record in as compared with and in and  respectively 
the video communications group s net income in was million as compared with million and in and  respectively  and its net profit margins were  and during those respective years 
income from operations of the omg  cmg and img in were higher than in and  while income from operations at avnet emg international in was below the record amount achieved in as the company has increased its investment in foreign operations  the impact associated with the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates has become more apparent 
the translation into us dollars of the financial statements of the company s foreign subsidiaries resulted in a million charge in  a million charge in and a million credit in which were recorded directly to shareholders equity 
the charge in was due primarily to the weakening of the french  german  italian and swedish currencies against the us dollar  and the charge in was due primarily to the weakening of the uk  french and german currencies against the us dollar 
the credit in was due primarily to the strengthening of the french  german  swedish and uk currencies against the uk dollar 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the statement of income was not material
