item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this form k 
overview the company purchases and processes rough rice into branded and commodity rice for sale in both international and domestic markets 
demand for branded rice products is relatively constant and margins are typically higher than those for commodity rice products 
demand for commodity rice products is relatively constant globally  but demand for us grown commodity rice is dependent upon supply and cost relative to other sources of supply 
supply and costs for both branded and commodity products depend on many factors including governmental actions  crop yields and weather  and such factors can persist through one or more fiscal years 
in general  management believes that it is insulated from many of the effects of rough rice price fluctuations for the following reasons i the company s net sales are proportionately weighted toward the relatively higher margin branded products  ii approximately one half of the company s rough rice purchases  excluding rough rice milled under contract for others  are made as spot market purchases and matched against commodity orders at prices providing a favorable margin to costs  iii the company s high rice inventory turnover rate of approximately five times per year reduces the company s exposure to seasonal price fluctuations  and iv the company s diversity of rice sources and rice customers increases the ability of the company to take advantage of supply and demand imbalances 
on july   the company acquired the domestic and foreign olive business of campbell soup company for approximately million

the olive acquisition is accounted for as a purchase  and the results of operations of the acquired business are page included in the company s consolidated financial statements after july  historically  sales of olives have pronounced seasonal elements  with higher sales occurring in conjunction with holiday consumption
