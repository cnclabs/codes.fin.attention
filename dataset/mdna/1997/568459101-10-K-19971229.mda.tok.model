item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview on november   in connection with the mergers  lca changed its name to paragon health network  inc while paragon is the same legal entity as lca  following the mergers the financial position of the company was significantly different from the financial position of the company prior to the mergers 
the historical financial information contained herein does not reflect the financial position of the company on a combined basis because the mergers were consummated subsequent to the company s fiscal year end of september  accordingly  all financial information as of september  contained herein should not be construed as being indicative of the financial position of the company following the mergers unless otherwise noted 
for an additional discussion of the mergers  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
on november   the board of directors of the company declared a three for one stock split to stockholders of record as of december  to be paid on december  the per share information contained in this section  and in the company s consolidated financial statements  is presented on a pro forma basis in order to give effect to the stock split 
the company derives its revenues by providing i post acute care  ii pharmacy  therapy  subacute and other specialty medical services  and iii contract management of specialty medical programs for acute care hospitals 
in general  the company generates higher revenues and operating income from the provision of specialty medical services than from routine skilled nursing care 
the company seeks to enhance its operating margins by increasing the proportion of its revenues derived from specialty medical services 
subacute care refers to complex medical care and intensive nursing care provided to patients with high acuity disorders 
post acute care refers to any care that a patient receives after discharge from an acute care hospital setting  including subacute  long term and specialty medical care 
long term care refers to care  typically conducted over an extended period of time  at a skilled nursing or assisted living facility  as well as care rendered in a patient s home  regardless of whether such care is rendered following discharge from an acute care hospital 
specialty medical services refer to any service provided by the company other than routine skilled nursing care 
the company s revenues and profitability are affected by ongoing efforts of third party payors to contain healthcare costs by limiting reimbursement rates  increasing case management review and negotiating reduced contract pricing 
government payors  such as state administered medicaid programs and  to a lesser extent  the federal medicare program  generally provide more restricted coverage and lower reimbursement rates than private pay sources 
results of operations the following table sets forth data from the statement of income expressed as a percentage of net revenues years ended september  net revenues nursing home non nursing home pharmacy therapy other costs and expenses salaries and wages employee benefits nursing  dietary  and other supplies ancillary services general and administrative depreciation and amortization provision for bad debts life insurance proceeds gain on sale impairment of long lived assets other mergers and acquisition cost income from operations interest expense  net income before income taxes and equity earnings minority interest provision for income taxes income before equity earnings minority interest equity earnings minority interest net income pro forma taxes pro forma net income nursing home revenues are derived from the provision of two basic services routine services million or in fiscal year and ancillary services million or in fiscal year and are a function of occupancy rates in the long term care facilities and the payor mix 
occupancy rates  as identified in the following table  decreased in fiscal year due to the divestiture of devcon see note to the consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and a higher level of competitive activity resulting from an increase in hospital operated skilled units  assisted living facilities  and other alternative care providers in key markets 
the devcon divestiture reduced weighted average licensed bed count by  and total average residents by  for fiscal year the company has invested in the marketing and managed care areas and has implemented an aggressive marketing program to increase census and improve quality mix 
years ended september  weighted average licensed bed count    total average residents    average occupancy payor mix is the source of payment for the services provided and consists of private pay  medicare and medicaid 
private pay includes revenue from individuals who pay directly for services without governmental assistance through the medicare and medicaid programs 
these sources include managed care companies  commercial insurers  health maintenance organizations and veteran s administration contractual payments 
managed care as a payor source to health care providers is expected to increase over the next several years 
the company has increased its managed care contracting capabilities and has created a system which allows the centralized case management of these patients within targeted markets 
however  the impact to the company of this increasing payor source cannot be determined at this time 
reimbursement rates from government sponsored programs  such as medicare and medicaid  are strictly regulated and subject to funding appropriations from federal and state governments 
to the extent unfavorable changes in economic conditions impact payments under governmental or third party payor programs  the company would be adversely affected 
see business regulation 
revenues derived from the company s pharmacy and therapy groups are also influenced by payor mix 
the table below presents the approximate percentage of the company s net patient revenues derived from the various sources of payment for the periods indicated years ended september  private pay medicare medicaid the higher percentage of revenues derived from private pay sources for fiscal year is primarily attributable to the growth in the company s pharmacy operations  which had a higher percentage of revenue derived from private pay sources than any other pay source  and the divestiture of devcon in the fourth quarter of fiscal year which resulted in a reduction in the percentage of net revenue derived from the medicaid program for fiscal year in addition to pharmacy operations  the higher percentages of revenue derived from private pay and medicare sources in fiscal year is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of american rehabilitation services  inc and tmi late in fiscal year average reimbursement rates for medicare patients have also increased more rapidly than for medicaid residents due primarily to the higher reimbursement rates associated with the increase in acuity levels 
although cost reimbursement for medicare residents generates a higher level of revenue per patient day  profitability is not proportionally increased due to the additional costs associated with the required higher level of care and other services for such residents 
the administrative procedures associated with the medicare cost reimbursement program generally preclude final determination of amounts due the company until cost reports are audited or otherwise reviewed and settled with the applicable administrative agencies 
the company does not expect any differences between revenue recorded and as finally determined to have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
costs and expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  primarily consist of salaries  wages  and employee benefits 
various federal  state  and local regulations impose  depending on the services provided  a variety of regulatory standards for the type  quality and level of personnel required to provide care or services 
these regulatory requirements have an impact on staffing levels  as well as the mix of staff  and therefore impact total costs and expenses 
see business regulation 
the cost of ancillary services  which includes pharmaceuticals  is also affected by the level of service provided and patient acuity 
general and administrative expenses include the cost of the company s various insurance programs  except worker s compensation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues comprising nursing home and non nursing home operations totaled billion for the year ended september   an increase of million or  as compared to fiscal revenues from nursing home operations decreased by million  which included million due to divestitures  primarily the disposition of the devcon operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and an million reduction due to lower average occupancy rates

the acquisition of pharmacies in fiscal year that occurred late in the year primarily caused the increase in pharmacy services revenue 
the closure of approximately clinics during fiscal that no longer met the company s financial or operating objectives resulted in a decrease in therapy services revenue 
the increase in home health  hospice and other services is primarily due to the purchase of colorado home care  inc in january and the purchase of the remaining interest in heart of america hospice  llc during fiscal year costs and expenses totaled billion for the year ended september   an increase of million or  as compared to fiscal excluding divestitures  costs for payroll and employee benefits  ancillary  and general and administrative increased by   and million  respectively

divestitures  primarily devcon  reduced total expenses by million 
the provision for bad debt expense increased by million for the year ended september   which included a reduction of million due to collection of a note receivable and other receivable that were substantially reserved 
the remaining increase of million was primarily due to an increase in average days outstanding for accounts receivable related to the increase in pharmacy revenues  which have a higher provision for bad debts  and focused medicare reviews in several states for therapy operations  which delays the payment cycle for medicare receivables while each claim receives a medical review 
in addition  the centralization of billing and collection for therapy operations resulted in delayed billing and a longer billing cycle which resulted in an increase in average days outstanding for receivables 
in order to improve the collection process  therapy operations have improved the timeliness of billing  implemented new collection procedures  and opened three new regional collections sites for the clinics 
therapy operations were partially removed from focused billing review in texas during the third fiscal quarter and fully removed in october  although certain other states remain on billing review 
although significant reductions in average days outstanding were achieved during the fourth quarter of fiscal  average days outstanding for the therapy operations remain high compared to historical levels 
as a result  the company recorded an additional provision for bad debts of million during the fourth quarter to reserve for potential uncollectibility on the older accounts 
merger and acquisition costs increased total expenses in fiscal year by million compared to a reduction of costs and expenses in fiscal of million from non recurring items 
the merger and acquisition costs of million for fiscal were related to the mergers 
the million reduction of expense from non recurring items for consisted of a million gain from the receipt of life insurance proceeds on the former president of the rehabilitation services group  a million gain in september on the sale of the devcon operations  a million charge primarily related to the closure of the company s medical supplies business and write off of unamortized loan acquisition costs related to the second amended and restated credit agreement  and a million impairment loss related to the adoption of sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements

divestiture of nursing home operations decreased revenue million and lower census reduced revenue by million 
non nursing home operations contributed million of the increase  consisting of million from pharmacy operations  million from therapy services and million from medical supplies 
acquisitions  primarily rehability  provided million of the million increase in non nursing home revenue 
costs and expenses  including non recurring items  totaled billion for the year ended september   an increase of million or  as compared to fiscal acquisitions  primarily rehability and tmi  were million of the increase  and divestitures reduced total expenses by million 
other increases include payroll and related items million and ancillary services million 
the increase in ancillary services corresponds to the increase in ancillary revenue and the higher level of patient acuity as well as an increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals related to higher pharmacy services revenue 
non recurring items reduced total costs and expenses in fiscal year by million compared to the million of merger and acquisition costs from the bcc purchase in fiscal non recurring items included a million gain from the receipt of life insurance proceeds on the former president of the rehabilitation services group 
in addition  the company recognized a million gain in september on the sale of its devcon operations  which provided training and habilitation services to individuals with mental retardation and developmental disabilities  through the recapitalization and subsequent sale of the majority of devcon s stock for million 
the company also recorded charges of million primarily related to the closure of its medical supplies business and the write off of unamortized loan acquisition costs related to the second amended and restated credit agreement 
the adoption of sfas  which occurred in the fourth quarter  resulted in the identification and measurement of an impairment loss of million related to nursing facilities with a history of cash flow losses million  certain other nursing facilities where management believed an impairment existed as a result of the competitive environment million  goodwill  primarily tmi million  and other assets to be disposed million 
management estimated the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by each of these assets and compared them to their carrying value 
if the undiscounted future cash flow estimates were less than the carrying value of the asset then the carrying value was written down to estimated fair value 
goodwill associated with an impaired asset was included with the carrying value of that asset in performing both the impairment test and in measuring the amount of impairment loss related to the asset 
fair value was estimated based on either management s estimate of fair value  present value of future cash flows  or market value less estimated cost to sell for certain facilities to be disposed 
the facilities with a history of cash flow losses operated at a loss for periods ranging from one to four years 
the undiscounted cash flows for tmi were estimated based on the operating results of tmi subsequent to the death of the president of the rehabilitation services group founder of tmi and adjusted for the loss of contracts and impending business changes as a result of his death see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decision regarding the disposition of certain nursing facilities  which had operating losses of million during fiscal  was completed at the time of adoption of sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest expense totaled million for the year ended september   an increase of million or  as compared to the same period for fiscal the increase reflects a full year of interest expense for fiscal versus three months of interest expense for fiscal on the additional debt incurred to acquire rehability

seasonality the company s revenues and operating income generally fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
this seasonality is related to a combination of factors which include the timing of medicaid rate increases  the number of work days in the period  and seasonal census cycles 
liquidity and capital resources historical cash and cash equivalents were million at september   a million decrease from september   and working capital was million  an increase of million during fiscal year cash provided by operations was million or million more than fiscal year net income of million and non cash items totaling million contributed to the cash provided by operations 
these items were offset by the decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million  primarily related to income taxes due on the gain on sale of devcon stock that were paid in the second quarter of fiscal year  and an increase in receivables of million 
the increase in receivables was primarily attributable to acquisitions million  revenue increases million  and an increase in average days outstanding million 
the increase in receivables resulting from an increase in average days outstanding is primarily related to the company s therapy operations 
the increase in receivables for the therapy operations is related to the centralization of billing and collection which resulted in delayed billing and a longer billing cycle  and focused billing review  primarily in texas 
focused billing review substantially increases the processing time for payment of therapy services by fiscal intermediaries 
therapy operations were partially removed from focused billing review in texas during the third fiscal quarter and fully removed in october  although certain other states remain on billing review 
in addition  therapy operations have implemented new collection procedures and opened three new regional collection sites for the clinics to improve the collection process 
although significant reductions in average days outstanding were achieved during the fourth quarter of fiscal  average days outstanding for the therapy operations remain high compared to historical levels 
as a result  the company recorded an additional provision for bad debts of million during the fourth quarter to reserve for potential uncollectibility on the older accounts

capital commitments on one assisted living facility remaining under construction and expansion of existing long term care facilities totaled million at september  these commitments are expected to be funded by cash from operations or the senior credit facility 
cash flow from the disposition of assets was primarily related to the divestiture of two long term care facilities in texas 
restricted investments increased million due to the collection of outstanding receivables from the company s third party insurance carrier and current year funding 
financing activities provided million during fiscal and were primarily used to fund acquisitions  investments  and other capital expenditures 
in addition to the senior credit facility  the company has a lease arrangement providing for up to million to be used as a funding mechanism for future assisted living and skilled nursing facility construction  lease conversions  and other facility acquisitions the synthetic lease 
this leasing program allows the company to complete these projects without committing significant financing resources 
the lease is an unconditional triple net lease for a period of seven years with the annual lease obligation a function of the amount spent by the lessor to acquire or construct the project  a variable interest rate  and commitment and other fees 
the company guarantees a minimum of approximately of the residual value of the leased property and also has an option to purchase the properties at any time prior to the maturity date at a price sufficient to pay the entire amount financed  accrued interest  and certain expenses 
at september  approximately million of this leasing arrangement was utilized 
the leasing program is accounted for as an operating lease 
liquidity and capital resources following the transactions senior credit facility 
prior to the mergers  both lca and grancare maintained senior credit facilities that were replaced with a new senior credit facility in connection with the mergers 
the senior credit facility consists of four components a year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of million the tranche a term loan facility  a year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of million the tranche b term loan facility  an year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of million the tranche c term loan facility  and a year revolving credit facility in the maximum amount of million the revolving credit facility

other significant indebtedness 
in connection with the mergers  the company became a party to various agreements between grancare and health and retirement properties trust hrpt and omega healthcare investors  inc omega 
hrpt is the holder of a mortgage loan to ams properties  inc ams properties  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  dated october   in the aggregate principal amount of million the hrpt loan 
the hrpt loan is secured  in part  by mortgage and security agreements dated as of march  collectively  the hrpt mortgage in favor of hrpt and encumbering two nursing facilities in wisconsin owned by ams properties 
hrpt has also leased seven nursing facilities located in arizona  california and south dakota to gci health care centers  inc gcihcc under a master lease agreement dated as of june  the gcihcc lease 
in connection with certain transactions effected in february by grancare s predecessor with vitalink pharmacy services  inc vitalink  vitalink a paid a consent fee to hrpt in the amount of million  which was promptly reimbursed by grancare immediately following the consummation of the transactions with vitalink and b entered into a limited guaranty not to exceed million in the aggregate of the obligations by grancare  ams properties and gcihcc under the hrpt mortgages  the gcihcc lease and the hrpt loan collectively  the hrpt obligations for so long as such obligations remained outstanding 
to support vitalink s limited guaranty of the foregoing obligations  grancare caused an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued to vitalink in the event vitalink made any payments under the limited guaranty the hrpt letter of credit 
in connection with obtaining hrpt s consent to the mergers  grancare and hrpt executed a restructure and asset exchange agreement dated october  pursuant to which hrpt and grancare are in the process of restructuring their relationship the hrpt grancare restructuring 
as a part of the hrpt grancare restructuring  hrpt consented to the consummation of the mergers and the transactions related thereto 
in addition  vitalink s guaranty of the hrpt obligations was released and the hrpt letter of credit was terminated and replaced with an unlimited guaranty by the company and all subsidiaries of the company having an ownership interest in ams and or gcihcc individually  a tenant entity and collectively  the tenant entities which guaranty is secured by a cash collateral deposit of million  the earned interest on which is retained by hrpt 
the performance by the tenant entities of their respective obligations to hrpt continues to be secured by a pledge of one million shares of hrpt common stock beneficially owned by grancare and  as part of the hrpt grancare restructuring  grancare agreed to waive the ability to request a release of such collateral upon the attainment of certain financial conditions 
accordingly  the company does not have the ability to sell these shares to meet any capital requirements 
the terms of the leases between hrpt and the tenant entities were extended to january   constituting lease extensions ranging from to years and the aggregate base rental for all facilities leased from hrpt excluding the exchange facilities as defined below increased by  per year 
ams properties will also prepay the million hrpt loan and hrpt will release the hrpt mortgage 
in addition  by april  the tenant entities will exchange  in a transaction structured as a like kind exchange transaction the exchange transaction  five nursing facilities the two nursing facilities previously subject to the hrpt mortgage and three nursing facilities currently owned by the company collectively the exchange facilities for four nursing facilities owned by hrpt 
following completion of the exchange transaction  the tenant entities will lease back the exchange facilities for an aggregate annual rent amount equal to the aggregate rent on the four hrpt facilities 
in consideration of the hrpt grancare restructuring  the company paid hrpt a one time restructuring payment of million 
the overall impact of the hrpt grancare restructuring is not expected to have any material effect on the company s operations or cash flows 
the company also paid an aggregate amount of million to vitalink pharmacy services  inc vitalink and manorcare  inc manorcare in connection with the settlement of certain litigation initiated by vitalink and manorcare seeking to enjoin the consummation of the grancare merger 
a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  professional health care management  inc phcmi  is the borrower under a million mortgage note executed on august  the omega note in favor of omega  and under the related michigan loan agreement dated as of june  as amended the omega loan agreement 
all million was outstanding as of december the omega loan bears interest at a rate which is adjusted annually based on either i changes in the consumer price index or ii a percentage of the change in gross revenues of phcmi and its subsidiaries from year to year  divided by million  whichever is higher  but in any event subject to a maximum rate not to exceed of the interest rate in effect for the omega loan for the prior calendar year 
the current interest rate is per annum 
the omega loan currently requires monthly  interest only payments 
additional interest accrues on the outstanding principal of the omega loan at the rate of per annum 
such interest is compounded annually and is due and payable on a pro rata basis at the time of each principal payment or prepayment 
beginning october   quarterly amortizing installments of principal in the amount of million will also become due and payable on the first day of each calendar quarter 
the entire outstanding principal amount of the omega loan is due and payable on august  the omega loan may be prepaid without penalty during the first days following august  payment of the omega loan after acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default will result in a prepayment penalty in the nature of a make whole premium 
in addition to the interest on the omega loan described in the preceding paragraph  and as a condition to obtaining omega s consent to the transaction between vitalink and grancare  phcmi agreed to pay additional interest to omega in the amount of  per month  through and including july  if the principal balance of the omega loan for any reason becomes due and payable prior to that date  there will be added to the indebtedness owed by phcmi i the sum of million  plus  ii interest thereon at per annum to the prepayment date  less iii the amount of such additional interest paid to omega prior to the prepayment date 
as substitute collateral for certain divested phcmi facilities  and as consideration for granting its consent to such divestiture  omega required grancare to cause a letter of credit in favor of omega to be issued in the amount of million the omega letter of credit 
the omega letter of credit can be drawn upon following the occurrence of i any event of default under the omega loan documents  ii if the omega letter of credit is not renewed or extended at least days prior to its scheduled expiration date currently march   or iii if certain representations  warranties or covenants of phcmi under the omega loan documents are breached and such breaches are not cured within the prescribed time after notice 
following the mergers  the company caused the omega letter of credit to be replaced with a new standby letter of credit issued under the senior credit facility 
the omega loan agreement obligates phcmi  among other things  to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of at least million  increased or decreased by of phcmi s net income but in no event less than million 
the company must contribute additional equity to phcmi if and when necessary to assure that such minimum tangible net worth test is met 
phcmi has satisfied this test in the past without the contribution of additional equity and management believes that it will continue to do so in the future 
other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 
while federal regulations do not provide states with grounds to curtail payments under their medicaid reimbursement programs due to state budget deficiencies or delays in enactment of new budgets  states have nevertheless curtailed payments in such circumstances in the past 
in particular  some states have delayed the payment of significant amounts owed to health care providers such as the company for health care services provided under their respective medicaid programs 
the failure by a state to reimburse the company for its medicaid receivables could have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
in addition to principal and interest payments on its long term indebtedness  the company has significant rent obligations relating to its leased facilities 
the company s estimated principal payments  cash interest payments  and rent obligations for are approximately million 
the company s operations require capital expenditures for renovations of existing facilities in order to continue to meet regulatory requirements  to upgrade facilities for the treatment of subacute patients and to accommodate the addition of specialty medical services  and to improve the physical appearance of its facilities for marketing purposes 
the company estimates that total capital expenditures for the year ending september  will be approximately million of which million represents maintenance capital expenditures 
management is in the process of integrating the operations of lca and grancare and conforming their respective accounting policies 
as discussed above  lca s provision for bad debt expense increased by million for the year ended september  as compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily as the result of an increase in average days outstanding for accounts receivable related to the increase in pharmacy revenues  focused medicare reviews in several states for therapy operations  and the centralization of billing and collection for therapy operations 
in addition  grancare increased its provision for bad debt expense by million in the quarter ended june  as a result of a change in methodology in calculating bad debt expense 
in connection with conforming the accounting policies of lca and grancare  management is continuing to monitor trends in the company s accounts receivable and is reviewing the company s collection procedures including the timing of filing claims for reimbursement and allowance policy  which could result in a historical adjustment to grancare s allowance for bad debts and in future changes to the company s bad debt expense 
the company believes that the cash flow generated from its operations  the company s cash and cash equivalents  together with amounts available under the senior credit facility  should be sufficient to fund its debt service requirements  working capital needs  anticipated capital expenditures and other operating expenses 
the revolving credit facility will provide the company with revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount at any time not to exceed million  of which million is expected to be available after considering approximately million in outstanding letters of credit 
the company s future operating performance and ability to service or refinance the notes and to extend or refinance the senior credit facility will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
as discussed above  the company s revenues are a function of occupancy rates in the company s facilities and payor mix 
management believes that the mergers will have a slightly positive effect on the company s occupancy rates and payor mix 
because the mergers were completed on november   the company plans to recognize the costs associated therewith during the quarter ending december  while management has not yet determined the amount of the costs  management expects that such costs will be significant 
impact of inflation the health care industry is labor intensive 
wages and other labor related costs are especially sensitive to inflation 
increases in wages and other labor related costs as a result of inflation  or the increase in minimum wage requirements effective september  without a corresponding increase in medicaid and medicare reimbursement rates would adversely impact the company
