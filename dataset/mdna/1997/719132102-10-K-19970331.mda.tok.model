in addition  as permitted under generally accepted accounting principles  for accounting purposes the merger was deemed to have occurred on march   the last day of drc s first quarter for fiscal as a result  i the historical financial statements of afr for periods prior to the date of the merger are no longer the historical financial statements of the company and therefore are no longer presented  ii the historical financial statements of the company for periods prior to the merger are those of drc  iii all references to the financial statements of the company apply to the historical financial statements of drc prior to and subsequent to the merger  and iv any references to afr apply solely to american family restaurants  inc and its financial statements prior to the merger 
on july   the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of bep 
the effective accounting date of the bep acquisition was june  the results of operations for were materially impacted by the merger and the bep acquisition 
during fiscal  revenue and related expenses increased significantly over prior years primarily as a result of these acquisitions 
as a result  fiscal operating results are not comparable to those of fiscal and fiscal the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under item  selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
general as set forth below  the company s denny s same store sales declined while restaurant operating income and operating income increased by million and million  respectively 
the increase in restaurant operating income is attributable to the increased number of restaurants owned  while the increase in operating income is primarily a result of the increase in restaurant operating income without a proportionate increase in administrative expenses 
the company s strategy is to pursue acquisitions that can be incrementally profitable as a result of the consolidation of administrative functions 
the development of new restaurants also increases restaurant operating income without a significant increase in administrative expenses 
as noted below  operating margins for the non branded restaurants are significantly lower than the margins arising from the company s denny s and black eyed pea restaurants 
the company therefore intends to convert certain of its remaining non branded restaurants to the denny s concept and to sell the remainder of its non branded restaurants as soon as practicable 
as of january   the company operated denny s restaurants in states 
the company s denny s restaurants that were open for a month period had average restaurant sales of  in fiscal as compared with  in fiscal denny s restaurants that were developed by the company had average sales of approximately million in fiscal in january  the company and denny s  inc adopted the breakaway breakfast value price strategy  which offered five breakfast items for or less 
the promotional advertising associated with the breakaway breakfast was directed primarily in a media markets  while the majority of the company s denny s restaurants are located in non a markets 
as a result  the company s operating results under this value pricing strategy reflected lower guest check averages without a corresponding increase in guest counts 
comparable restaurant sales declined through january  and margins were adversely impacted  primarily as a result of increased labor costs 
however  comparable restaurant sales for the company s current denny s restaurants  which include restaurants converted from non branded restaurants  increased over the prior year 
in july and september  the company and denny s  inc  respectively  withdrew from the breakaway breakfast promotional specials and increased the price of the grand slam breakfast special to during certain periods of the day 
as a result  the average guest check increased from during the week period ended july  to for the period from july  through january  however  guest counts for the period from july  through january  have decreased approximately as compared with the comparable period in the prior year 
the company believes that the increase in the pricing tiers within the value pricing strategy will result in improved long term operating results
