item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations resource mortgage capital  inc the company is a mortgage and consumer finance company which uses its production operations to create investments for its portfolio 
currently  the company s primary loan production operations include the origination of mortgage loans secured by multi family properties and the origination of loans secured by manufactured homes 
the company will securitize loans funded principally as collateral for collateralized bonds  limiting its credit risk and providing long term financing for those loans securitized 
the company may also use other securitization vehicles for its loan production  such as pass through securities 
the company intends to expand its production sources in the future to include other financial products  such as commercial real estate loans 
the majority of the company s current investment portfolio is comprised of loans or securities arm loans or arm securities that have coupon rates which adjust over time subject to certain limitations in conjunction with changes in short term interest rates 
the company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust reit for federal income tax purposes and  as such  must distribute substantially all of its taxable income to shareholders and will generally not be subject to federal income tax 
on may   the company completed the sale of its single family mortgage operations to dominion mortgage services  inc dominion  a wholly owned subsidiary of dominion resources  inc  for million 
included in the single family mortgage operations were the company s single family correspondent  wholesale and servicing operations 
the sale resulted in a net gain of million 
such amount included a provision of million for possible losses on single family loans where the company has retained a portion of the credit risk and where  prior to the sale  the company had serviced such single family loans 
the company s principle source of earnings is net interest income on its investment portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio consists principally of collateral for collateralized bonds  arm securities and loans held for securitization 
the company funds its portfolio investments with both borrowings and cash raised from the issuance of equity capital 
for the portion of portfolio investments funded with borrowings  the company generates net interest income to the extent that there is a positive spread between the yield on the earning assets and the cost of borrowed funds 
for that portion of the balance sheet that is funded with equity capital  net interest income is primarily a function of the yield generated from the interest earning asset 
the cost of the company s borrowings may be increased or decreased by interest rate swap  cap or floor agreements 
approximately billion of the company s investment portfolio as of december   is comprised of arm loans or arm securities 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  the company s net interest spread earned on its investment portfolio will decrease 
the decrease of the net interest spread results from i the lag in resets of the arm loans underlying the arm securities and collateral for collateralized bonds relative to the rate resets on the associated borrowings and ii rate resets on the arm loans which are generally limited to every six months  while the associated borrowings have no such limitation 
as interest rates stabilize and the arm loans reset  the net interest margin may be restored to its former level as the yields on the arm loans adjust to market conditions 
conversely  net interest margin may increase following a fall in short term interest rates 
however  this increase may be temporary as the yields on the arm loans adjust to the new market conditions after a lag period 
in each case  however  the company expects that the increase or decrease in the net interest spread due to changes in the short term interest rates is temporary 
the net interest spread may also be increased or decreased by the cost or proceeds of interest rate swap  cap or floor agreements 
the company strives to create a diversified portfolio of investments that  in the aggregate  generates stable income for the company in a variety of interest rate environments and preserves the capital base of the company 
the company seeks to generate growth in earnings and dividends per share in a variety of ways  including i adding investments to its portfolio when opportunities in the market are favorable  ii developing production capabilities to originate and acquire financial assets in order to create attractively priced investments for its portfolio  as well as control the underwriting and servicing of such financial assets and iii increasing the efficiency with which the company utilizes its equity capital over time 
to increase potential returns to shareholders  the company also employs leverage through the use of secured borrowings and repurchase agreements to fund a portion of its portfolio investments 
currently  the company s production operations are comprised of multi family and manufactured housing lending 
the company s strategy is to expand these existing production sources as well as to diversify into other financial products such as commercial real estate loans 
the company also intends to selectively purchase single family loans in bulk with the intent to securitize such loans as collateral for collateralized bonds 
by pursuing these strategies  the company believes it can create investments for the portfolio at a lower effective cost than if investments of comparable risk profiles were purchased in the market  although there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in accomplishing this strategy 
in order to grow its equity base  the company may issue additional shares of preferred or common stock 
management strives to issue such additional shares when it believes existing shareholders are likely to benefit from such offerings through higher earnings and dividends per share than as compared to the level of earnings and dividends the company would likely generate without such offerings 
on august   the company acquired multi family capital markets  inc mcm  which specializes in the sourcing  underwriting and closing of multi family loans secured by first liens on apartment properties that have qualified for low income housing tax credits 
the company acquired all of the outstanding stock and assets of mcm for million 
the company believes this acquisition will complement its current strategy of expanding its multi family lending business and will improve its competitive position in the marketplace for such loans

in  no preferred stock was outstanding  and all sars outstanding were anti dilutive 
compared to the increase in the company s net income and net income per common share during as compared to is primarily the result of the increase in net interest margin and the gain on the sale of the single family operations 
this increase was offset partially by a decline in the gain on sale of assets and an increase in general and administrative expenses 
net interest margin for increased to million  or  over net interest margin of million for this increase was a result of an overall increase in the net interest spread on all interest earning assets which increased to for versus for  as well as the increased contribution from the net investment in collateralized bonds 
the increase in the net interest spread is attributable to the arm securities being fully indexed during  and the more favorable interest rate environment on both collateralized bonds and borrowings related to the arm securities 
during  as a result of rising short term rates during both and early  the company s arm securities were generally not fully indexed throughout the year 
the sale of the company s single family mortgage operations in generated a net gain of million 
previously  the single family mortgage operations had contributed to the company s earnings through the securitization and sale of loans funded through its production activities  recorded as gain on sale of assets 
in  the company recorded a net gain on sale of assets related to the securitization and sale of loans amounting to million 
no gain on securitization or sale of loans was recorded in net gain on sale of assets during resulted primarily from the sale of certain portfolio assets totaling approximately million  offset partially by the write down of certain assets for permanent impairment of million 
in  the company sold portfolio assets for a net gain of million and recorded no write downs 
the company also sold previously purchased mortgage servicing rights in for a gain of million 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in  as the company continued building its infrastructure for its manufactured housing operations 
general and administrative expenses also increased from as a result of the company s continued expansion of its wholesale origination capabilities for its single family mortgage operations prior to their sale 
the company continues to expand its manufactured housing operations  and in august  acquired mcm to expand its multi family and commercial real estate lending businesses 
currently the company retains the servicing for all loans funded through its production operations 
the growth of the production operations should continue to cause general and administrative expenses to increase in compared to the decrease in the company s earnings during as compared to is primarily the result of the decrease in net gain on sale of assets and the decrease in net interest margin 
these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses 
net gain on sale of assets decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease resulted from the combined effect of i the company s change in securitization strategy in to the issuance of collateralized bonds which are accounted for as financing transactions  versus the use of pass through mortgage security structures in  which are accounted for as sales  ii the lower mortgage loan funding levels by the company as a result of a decrease in overall industry wide mortgage loan originations  resulting from a higher level of price competition for mortgage loans and iii the flatter yield curve  which had an adverse impact on the company s production of arm loans 
net interest margin decreased million  or  to million in from million for this decrease resulted primarily from the change in the net interest spread on the interest earning assets  which declined from in to in the decline in net interest spread was attributable to a temporary reduction in the net interest spread in arm securities 
this temporary reduction resulted from the interest rate on borrowings increasing at a faster rate than the arm securities which collateralize these borrowings 
in december  the net interest spread had increased to as a result of the upward resets on the arm securities and the more favorable short term interest rate environment 
net interest margin also declined as a result of the increase in the provision for credit losses  which was million and million in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased  to million for from million for this decline resulted primarily from the company s effort to reduce costs in line with the reduced level of mortgage loan originations

compared to the increase in net interest spread for relative to is primarily the result of the increase in the spread on arm securities and an increase in the average balance and spread on the net investment in collateralized bonds  which for  constituted the largest portion of the company s investment portfolio on a weighted average basis 
the net interest spread benefited as a result of the declining short term interest rate environment during the first part of  which had the impact of reducing the company s borrowing costs faster than it reduced the yields on the company s interest earning assets 
the company s overall weighted average borrowing costs decreased to for from for the overall yield on interest earning assets increased to from as the company s portfolio became more heavily weighted in collateral for collateralized bonds which have higher effective rates than arm securities

the spread on the company s investment portfolio decreased from for to for specifically  the spread on the company s arm securities decreased from for to for  principally as a result of increased repurchase agreement borrowing costs 
this decline was offset by the increase in the spread on the net investment in collateralized bonds  which increased to in from in the increase in the net interest spread for the net investment in collateralized bonds resulted principally from lower financing costs in the average balance of collateral for collateralized bonds increased to million for from million for  consistent with the company s current securitization strategy  while the average balance for arm securities declined from billion in to billion in the following tables summarize the amount of change in interest income and interest expense due to changes in interest rates versus changes in volume to to amounts in thousands rate volume total rate volume total collateral for collateralized bonds       adjustable rate mortgage securities       fixed rate mortgage securities       other mortgage securities     other portfolio assets     loans held for securitization      total interest income      collateralized bonds       repurchase agreements adjustable rate mortgage securities       fixed rate mortgage securities     other mortgage securities loans held for securitization       notes payable other portfolio assets  loans held for securitization     commercial paper   total interest expense       net interest income       note the change in interest income and interest expense due to changes in both volume and rate  which cannot be segregated  has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

portfolio results the company s investment strategy is to create a diversified portfolio of securities that  in the aggregate  generates stable income in a variety of interest rate and prepayment rate environments and preserves the capital base of the company 
the company has pursued its strategy of concentrating on its production activities to create investments with attractive yields 
in many instances  the company s investment strategy has involved not only the creation or acquisition of the asset  but also the related long term  non recourse borrowings such as through the issuance of collateralized bonds 
interest income and interest earning assets the company s average interest earning assets grew to billion during the year ended december   an increase of from billion of average interest earning assets during the year ended december  average interest earning assets at december   decreased slightly from billion during the year ended december  as a result of the sale of billion of securities during total interest income rose  from million during the year ended december   to million during the same period of total interest income had also risen during from million during the year ended december  overall  the yield on average interest earning assets rose to for the year ended december   from and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase resulted from the arm securities resetting upwards to become fully indexed and the investment in higher yielding collateral for collateralized bonds continuing to grow 
as indicated in the table below  the average yields were  and higher than the average daily six month libor interest rate during  and  respectively 
the majority of the arm loans underlying the company s arm securities and collateral for collateralized bonds are indexed to and reset based upon the level of the london interbank offered rate libor for six month deposits six month libor 
earning asset yield in millions average asset yield interest earning interest average daily average versus six assets income asset yield six month month libor the net yield on average interest earning assets increased to for the year ended december   compared to and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is principally due to the increase in the spread earned on the interest earning assets  despite an increase in average interest earning assets to billion for the year ended december   from billion in average interest earning assets may continue to increase as the company retains loans funded through its production operations as collateral for collateralized bonds 
net yield on average interest earning assets may decrease as a result 
net yield as a percentage of net average assets defined as interest earning assets less non recourse collateralized bonds issued  was for the year ended december   versus and for the same periods in and  respectively 
net yield as a percentage of net average assets is expected to increase due to the continued use of non recourse collateralized bonds 
the net yield percentages presented below exclude non interest related expenses such as provision for credit losses and interest on senior notes payable 
for the years ended december   and  if these expenses were included  the net yield on average interest earning assets would be  and  respectively and the net yield on net average assets would be  and  respectively 
net yield on average interest earning assets in millions net yield on average average net yield on interest earning interest earning net average net average assets assets assets assets average interest earning assets less non recourse collateralized bonds 
the average asset yield is reduced for the amortization of premiums  net of discounts on the company s investment portfolio 
by creating its investments through its production operations  the company believes that premium amounts are less than if the investments were acquired in the market 
as indicated in the table below  premiums on the company s arm securities  fixed rate securities and collateral for collateralized bonds at december  were million  or approximately of the aggregate investment portfolio balance 
the mortgage principal repayment rate for the company indicated in the table below as cpr annualized rate was for the year ended december  the company expects that the long term prepayment speeds will range between and

interest expense and cost of funds the company s largest expense is the interest cost on borrowed funds 
funds to finance the investment portfolio are borrowed primarily in the form of collateralized bonds or repurchase agreements  both of which are primarily indexed to libor  principally one month libor 
for the year ended december   interest expense increased to million from million for the year ended  while the average cost of funds decreased to for compared to for the company s cost of funds rose in conjunction with the increase in the one month libor rate through the second quarter of and then began to decline correspondingly with the decline in interest rates since that time 
the cost of funds for the year ended december   compared to  increased as a result of the low interest rates during the first half of compared to the rapidly rising interest rates during the first half of the company may use interest rate swaps  caps and financial futures to manage its interest rate risk 
the net costs during the related period of these instruments are included in the cost of funds table below 
cost of funds in millions cost of gaap funds average interest cost average versus borrowed expense of one month one month funds a funds libor libor a excludes non interest related expenses and interest on non portfolio related notes payable 
interest rate agreements as part of its asset liability management process  the company enters into interest rate agreements  such as interest rate caps and swaps  and financial futures contracts hedges 
these agreements are used to reduce interest rate risk which arise from the lifetime yield caps on the arm securities  the mismatched repricing of portfolio investments versus borrowed funds and assets repricing on indices such as the prime rate which are different than the related borrowing indices  primarily one month libor 
the agreements are designed to protect the portfolio s cash flow and to provide income and capital appreciation to the company in the event that short term interest rates rise quickly 
the following table includes all interest rate agreements in effect at december   and for asset liability management of the investment portfolio 
this table excludes all hedge agreements in effect for the company s production operations 
generally  interest rate swaps and caps are used to manage the interest rate risk associated with assets that have periodic and annual reset limitations financed with borrowings that have no such limitations 
financial futures contracts and options on futures are used to effectively lengthen the terms of repurchase agreement financing  generally from one month to three and six months 
there were no financial futures contracts and options on futures outstanding at december  the average notional amount of futures and options on futures outstanding during were million and million  respectively 
amounts presented are aggregate notional amounts 
to the extent any of these agreements are terminated  gains and losses are generally amortized over the remaining period of the original agreement

net interest rate agreement expense the net interest rate agreement expense  or hedging expense  equals the expenses  net of any benefits received  from these agreements

such amounts exclude the hedging costs and benefits associated with the company s production activities as these amounts are deferred as additional premium or discount on the loan funded and amortized over the life of the loan as an adjustment to its yield 
the increase in net interest rate agreement expense for compared to is primarily the result of the addition of an interest rate swap agreements to reduce the company s exposure to basis risk for certain collateral for collateralized bonds and to cap the borrowing costs during any six month period for a portion of the short term borrowings 
the increase in the net interest rate agreement expense for compared to is due primarily to the addition of an interest rate swap agreement entered into to reduce the interest rate risk on fixed rate loans in the collateral for collateralized bonds

this increase in the portfolio s value is primarily attributable to the increase in the value of the collateral for collateralized bonds relative to the collateralized bonds issued during the last twelve months  as well as an increase in value of the company s arm securities due principally to the arm securities being fully indexed 
the portfolio also benefited from the stabilization of interest rates and the reduction in amortized cost basis of its investments through additional provision for losses 
at december   the fair value of the company s available for sale investments was million below its amortized cost basis  reflecting market place volatility due to the rapid increase in short term interest rates at the time 
credit exposures the company has historically securitized its loan production in pass through or collateralized bonds securitization structures 
with either structure  the company may use overcollateralization  subordination  reserve funds  bond insurance  mortgage pool insurance or any combination of the foregoing for credit enhancement 
regardless of the form of credit enhancement  the company may retain a limited portion of the direct credit risk after securitization 
this risk can include risk of loss related to hazards not covered under standard hazard insurance policies and credit risks on loans not covered by standard borrower mortgage insurance  or pool insurance 
beginning in  the company issued pass through securities which used subordination structures as their form of credit enhancement 
the credit risk of subordinated pass through securities is concentrated in the subordinated classes which may themselves partially be credit enhanced with reserve funds or pool insurance of the securities  thus allowing the senior classes of the securities to receive the higher credit rating 
to the extent credit losses are greater than expected or exceed the protection provided by any reserve funds or pool insurance  the holders of the subordinated securities will experience a lower yield which may be negative than expected on their investments 
at december   the company retained million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated securities  which are carried at a value of million  reflecting such potential credit loss exposure 
with collateralized bond structures  the company also retains credit risk relative to the amount of overcollateralization required in conjunction with the bond insurance 
losses are generally first applied to the overcollateralization amount  with any losses in excess of that amount borne by the bond insurer or the holders of the various classes of the collateralized bonds 
the company only incurs credit losses to the extent that losses are incurred in the repossession  foreclosure and sale of the underlying collateral 
such losses generally equal the excess of the principal amount outstanding plus servicer advances  less any proceeds from mortgage or hazard insurance  over the liquidation value of the collateral 
to compensate the company for retaining this loss exposure  the company generally receives an excess yield on the collateralized loans relative to the yield on the collateralized bonds 
at december   the company retained million in aggregate principal amount of overcollateralization and had reserves  or otherwise had provided coverage  on million of the potential credit loss exposure 
this reserve includes a provision recorded as a result of the sale of the single family operations of approximately million for possible losses on securitized single family loans where the company  which performed the servicing of such loans prior to the sale  has retained a portion of the credit risk on these loans 
also as a result from the sale of the single family operations  a million loss reimbursement guarantee from dominion mortgage services  inc has been included in the reserves at december  the company principally used pool insurance as its means of credit enhancement for years prior to pool insurance has generally been unavailable as a means of credit enhancement since the beginning of pool insurance covered substantially all credit risk for the security with the exception of fraud in the origination or certain special hazard risks 
loss exposure due to special hazards is generally limited to an amount equal to a fixed percentage of the principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans at the time of securitization 
fraud in the origination exposure is generally limited to those loans which default within one year of origination 
the reserve for potential losses on these risks was million at december   which the company believes represents its potential exposure from these risks 
the following table summarizes the aggregate principal amount of collateral for collateralized bonds and pass through securities outstanding which are subject to credit exposure  the maximum credit exposure held by the company represented by the amount of overcollateralization and first loss securities owned by the company  the credit reserves available to the company for such exposure through provision for losses  indemnifications or insurance and the actual credit losses incurred

the aggregate principal amount of investments sold during was million  consisting of million of arm securities and million of other mortgage securities 
these sales  along with the re securitization of certain arm securities  reduced short term borrowings by approximately billion and the company recognized net losses of million

additionally  the company purchased approximately million of arm securities and million of fixed rate mortgage securities for its investment portfolio 
production activities until may  the company s production operations were comprised mainly of its single family mortgage operations that concentrated on the non conforming segment of the residential loan market 
the company funded its single family loans directly through mortgage brokers wholesale and purchased loans through a network of mortgage companies correspondents 
loans originated through the company s former single family mortgage operations constitute the majority of loans underlying the securities that comprise the company s current portfolio assets 
since the sale of the company s single family mortgage operations  the company s primary production operations have been focused on multi family lending and manufactured housing lending 
the company is in the process of broadening its multi family lending capabilities to include other types of commercial real estate loans and to expand its manufactured housing lending to include inventory financing to manufactured housing dealers 
the company may also purchase single family loans on a bulk basis from time to time  and may originate such loans on a retail basis 
the purpose of the company s production operations is to enhance the return on shareholders equity roe by earning a favorable net interest spread while loans are in warehouse being accumulated for securitization or sale and creating investments for its portfolio at a lower cost than if such investments were purchased from third parties 
the creation of such investments generally involves the issuance of pass through securities or collateralized bonds collateralized by the loans generated from the company s production activities  and the retention of one or more classes of the securities or collateralized bonds relating to such issuance 
the issuance of pass through securities and collateralized bonds generally limits the company s credit and interest rate risk relating to loans generated by the company s production operations 
when a sufficient volume of loans is accumulated  the company generally securitizes the loans through the issuance of collateralized bonds or pass through securities 
the company believes that securitization is an efficient and cost effective way for the company to i reduce capital otherwise required to own the loans in whole loan form  ii limit the company s exposure to credit risk on the loans  iii lower the overall cost of financing the loans  and iv depending on the securitization structure  limit the company s exposure to interest rate and or valuation risk 
as a result of the reduction in the availability of mortgage pool insurance  and the company s desire to both reduce its recourse borrowings as a percentage of its overall borrowings and the variability of its earnings  the company has utilized the collateralized bonds structure for securitizing substantially all of its loan production since the beginning of the following table summarizes the production activity for the three years ended december   and production activity in thousands year ended december  multi family    manufactured housing  single family    total principal amount of loans funded through    production operations single family loans bulk   purchased principal amount securitized    or sold compared to the decrease in the overall funding volume of loans for as compared to is mainly the result of the sale of the company s single family mortgage operations in may this decrease was partially offset by the increase in multi family loans funded and the commencement of manufactured housing lending 
the manufactured housing operations began funding loans during the second quarter of since its initial start up  the company has opened region offices in north carolina  georgia  texas and michigan 
the company is planning to establish a fifth regional office on the west coast during the second quarter of principally all funding volume has been obtained through relationships with manufactured housing dealers 
as of december   the company had million in principal balance of manufactured housing loans in inventory  and had commitments outstanding of approximately million 
as of december   manufactured housing loans that were day delinquent totaled million 
in the future  the company plans to expand its sources of origination to nearly all sources for manufactured housing loans by establishing relationships with park owners  developers of manufactured housing communities  manufacturers of manufactured homes  brokers and correspondents 
in addition  the company will begin offering dealer inventory financing during the first quarter once certain volume levels are achieved at a particular region  district offices may be opened in an effort to further market penetration 
the first district office is expected to be opened in the first quarter of as of december   the company had million in principal balance of multi family loans held for securitization compared with million at december  there are no multi family loan delinquencies as of december  principally all fundings are under the company s lending programs for properties that have been allocated low income housing tax credits 
as of december   commitments to fund multi family loans over the next months were approximately million 
the company expects that it will have funded volume sufficient enough to securitize a portion of its multi family mortgage loans held for securitization in the first half of through the issuance of collateralized bonds 
the company will retain a portion of the credit risk after securitization and intends to service the loans 
the company s securitization strategy for focused on securitizing its loan production through the issuance of collateralized bonds 
these securitizations are recorded as financing transactions and as such  no gain on sale is recorded at the time of the securitization 
instead  income related to the net collateralized bond investment is recognized over time as part of net margin income 
in the company securitized approximately billion of loans through the issuance of collateralized bonds compared to million in during there were no whole loan pool sales or pass through securitizations 
compared to the decrease in the funding volume of loans in as compared to resulted from the lower overall mortgage loan originations in the market and an increased level of price competition for mortgage loans 
additionally  approximately of the mortgage loans funded by the company were arm loans  which declined as a percentage of the overall loan origination market as a result of the flat yield curve environment during much of during  a substantial portion of the company s loan production was securitized through the issuance of collateralized bonds 
of the remaining production in  the company sold whole loan pools aggregating million  and securitized million of mortgage loans using a senior subordinated structure 
the net gain on securitizations and sales of these mortgage loans  excluding recognition of deferred gains  amounted to million for this represented a decline of million  or  from net gains on sale of mortgage loans of million for during  the company acquired a mortgage servicing company with a servicing portfolio of approximately million

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
fas no 
provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities based on consistent application of a financial components approach that focuses on control of the respective assets and liabilities 
it distinguishes transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
fas no 
is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after december  the impact of this statement on the company s financial position and results of operations has not been determined  but is not expected to be material 
liquidity and capital resources the company has various sources of cash flow upon which it relies for its working capital needs 
sources of cash flow from operations include primarily the return of principal on its portfolio investments and the issuance of collateralized bonds 
other borrowings provide the company with additional cash flow in the event that it is necessary 
historically  these sources have provided sufficient liquidity for the conduct of the company s operations 
however  if a significant decline in the market value of the company s portfolio assets should occur  the company s available liquidity from these other borrowings may be reduced 
as a result of such a reduction in liquidity  the company may be forced to sell certain portfolio assets in order to maintain liquidity 
if required  these sales could be made at prices lower than the carrying value of such assets  which could result in losses 
the company borrows funds on a short term basis to support the accumulation of loans prior to the sale of such loans or the issuance of mortgage or asset backed securities 
these borrowings may bear fixed or variable interest rates  may require additional collateral in the event that the value of the existing collateral declines and may be due on demand or upon the occurrence of certain events 
if borrowing costs are higher than the yields on the assets financed with such funds  the company s ability to acquire or fund additional assets may be substantially reduced and it may experience losses 
these short term borrowings consist of the company s lines of credit and repurchase agreements and are paid down as the company securitizes or sells loans 
a substantial portion of the assets of the company are pledged to secure indebtedness incurred by the company 
accordingly  those assets would not be available for distribution to any general creditors or the stockholders of the company in the event of the company s liquidation  except to the extent that the value of such assets exceeds the amount of the indebtedness they secure 
lines of credit at december   the company has three credit facilities aggregating million to finance loan fundings and for working capital purposes of which million expires in and million expires in one of these facilities includes several sublines aggregating million to serve various purposes  such as multi family loan fundings  working capital  and manufactured housing loan fundings  which may not  in the aggregate  exceed the overall facility commitment of million at any time 
working capital borrowings are limited to million 
the company expects that these credit facilities will be renewed  if necessary  at their respective expiration dates  although there can be no assurance of such renewal 
the lines of credit contain certain financial covenants which the company met as of december  however  changes in asset levels or results of operations could result in the violation of one or more covenants in the future 
repurchase agreements the company finances certain of its portfolio assets through repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements allow the company to sell such portfolio assets for cash together with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same portfolio assets on a specified date for a price which is equal to the original sales price plus an interest component 
at december   the company had outstanding obligations of million under such repurchase agreements  of which million  million and million were secured by arm securities  fixed rate mortgage securities and other mortgage securities  respectively compared to billion in repurchase agreements at december   secured by billion  million and million  respectively in arm securities  fixed securities and other mortgage securities 
increases in either short term interest rates or long term interest rates could negatively impact the valuation of these mortgage securities and may limit the company s borrowing ability or cause various lenders to initiate margin calls 
additionally  certain of the company s arm securities are aaa or aa rated classes that are subordinate to related aaa rated classes from the same series of securities 
such aaa or aa rated classes have less liquidity than securities that are not subordinated and the value of such classes is more dependent on the credit rating of the related insurer or the credit performance of the underlying mortgage loans 
in instances of a downgrade of an insurer or the deterioration of the credit quality of the underlying mortgage collateral  the company may be required to sell certain portfolio assets in order to maintain liquidity 
if required  these sales could be made at prices lower than the carrying value of the assets  which could result in losses 
the company owns million of its collateralized bonds at december  and has financed such collateralized bonds with million of short term debt 
this compares to approximately million in collateralized bonds at december  financed with million of short term debt 
for financial statement presentation purposes  the company has classified the million and million of short term debt at december  and  respectively  as collateralized bonds outstanding 
the company also may finance a portion of its loans held for securitization with repurchase agreements on an uncommitted basis 
at december   the company had no outstanding obligations under such repurchase agreements 
potential immediate sources of liquidity for the company include cash balances and unused availability on the credit facilities 
at december   the company had an estimated unused borrowing capacity of million 
the total immediate sources of liquidity totaled million  or of recourse borrowings 
recourse borrowings exclude borrowings  such as collateralized bonds  that are non recourse to the company 
unsecured borrowings the company issued two series of unsecured notes totaling million in the proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes 
at december   the notes have an outstanding balance at of million compared to million at december  the first principal repayment of one of the notes was due october and annually thereafter  with quarterly interest payments due 
principal repayment on the second note is contracted to begin in october the notes mature between and and bear interest at and 
the note agreements contain certain financial covenants which the company met as of december  however  changes in asset levels or results of operations could result in the violation of one or more covenants in the future 
the company also has various acquisition notes totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
preferred stock offering in october  the company issued million shares of series c cumulative convertible preferred stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds from this issuance totaled million and were used to pay down short term debt  as well as for general corporate purposes 
fourth quarter review the company reported net income of million for the fourth quarter of and earnings per common share of 
these results compare favorably with the fourth quarter of net income of million and earnings per common share of 
compared with the fourth quarter of  the company s fourth quarter results reflect mainly an increase in the net interest margin  offset partially by an increase general and administrative expenses 
net interest margin totaled million for the fourth quarter of compared with million for the fourth quarter of the increase resulted primarily from an increase in average interest earning assets to billion for the fourth quarter of compared to billion for the fourth quarter of the increase in the average interest earning assets was primarily due to the addition of billion in collateral for collateralized bonds during additionally  the spread on the net investment in collateralized bonds increased from for the fourth quarter of to for the fourth quarter of these factors were the major contributors to the overall increase in the net interest spread on all interest earning assets from in the fourth quarter of to for the fourth quarter of annualized return on common shareholders equity was in the fourth quarter of compared to for the fourth quarter of the average borrowed funds increased million to billion for the fourth quarter of compared to billion for the fourth quarter of this increase was directly related to the increase in the average interest earning assets  primarily collateral for collateralized bonds 
while the average borrowings increased for the fourth quarter of  the average cost of funds decreased in comparison with the same quarter in the decrease in the cost of funds was due to the decrease in the average one month libor rate in the fourth quarter of in comparison to the fourth quarter of loan production for the fourth quarter of decreased from the fourth quarter of primarily as a result of the sale of the single family mortgage operations in the second quarter of this decrease in single family mortgage lending during the fourth quarter of was partially offset by the increase in multi family and manufactured housing lending during the fourth quarter of in comparison to the same period for summary of selected quarterly results unaudited amounts in thousands except share data year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter operating results total revenues     net interest margin     net income     primary net income per common share fully diluted net income per common share cash dividends declared per common share annualized return on common shareholders equity average interest earning assets     average borrowed funds     net interest spread on interest earning assets average asset yield net yield on average interest earning assets cost of funds loans funded     year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter operating results total revenues     net interest margin     net income     net income per common share cash dividends declared per common share annualized return on common shareholders equity average interest earning assets     average borrowed funds     net interest spread on interest earning assets average asset yield net yield on average interest earning assets cost of funds loans funded     computed as net interest margin excluding non interest collateralized bond expenses and interest on senior notes payable

forward looking statements certain written statements in this form k made by the company  that are not historical fact  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements may involve factors that could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company cautions the public not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which may be based on assumptions and anticipated events that do not materialize 
the company does not undertake  and the securities litigation reform act specifically relieves the company from  any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause actual results to differ from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by forward looking statements include the following economic conditions 
the company is affected by consumer demand for manufactured housing  multi family housing and other products which it finances 
a material decline in demand for these goods and services would result in a reduction in the volume of loans originated by the company 
the risk of defaults and credit losses could increase during an economic slowdown or recession 
this could have an adverse effect on the company s financial performance and the performance on the company s securitized loan pools 
capital resources 
the company relies on various credit facilities and repurchase agreements with certain investment banking firms to help meet the company s short term funding needs 
the company believes that as these agreements expire  they will continue to be available or will be able to be replaced  however no assurance can be given as to such availability or the prospective terms and conditions of such agreements or replacements 
interest rate fluctuations 
the company s income depends on its ability to earn greater interest on its investments than the interest cost to finance these investments 
interest rates in the markets served by the company generally rise or fall with interest rates as a whole 
a majority of the loans currently originated by the company are fixed rate 
the profitability of a particular securitization may be reduced if interest rates increase substantially before these loans are securitized 
in addition  the majority of the investments held by the company are securities or loans with adjustable rates 
these investments are financed through short term repurchase agreements and floating rate collateralized bonds 
the net interest spread for these investments could decrease during a period of rapidly rising interest rates  since the investments have interest rate caps and the related borrowing have no such interest rate caps 
defaults 
defaults may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance  if actual credit losses differ materially from estimates made by the company at the time of securitization 
the allowance for losses is calculated on the basis of historical experience and management s best estimates 
actual defaults may differ from the company s estimate as a result of economic conditions 
actual defaults on arm loans may increase during a rising interest rate environment 
the company believes that its reserves are adequate for such risks 
prepayments 
prepayments may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance  if prepayments differ materially from estimates made by the company 
the prepayment rate is calculated on the basis of historical experience and management s best estimates 
actual rates of prepayment may vary as a result of the prevailing interest rate 
prepayments are expected to increase during a declining interest rate environment 
the company s exposure to more rapid prepayments is i the faster amortization of premium on the investments and ii the replacement of investments in its portfolio with lower yield securities 
competition 
the financial services industry is a highly competitive market 
increased competition in the market could adversely affect the company s market share within the industry 
regulatory changes 
the company s business is subject to federal and state regulation which  among other things  require the company to maintain various licenses and qualifications and require specific disclosures to borrowers 
changes in existing laws and regulations or in the interpretation thereof  or the introduction of new laws and regulations  could adversely affect the company s operation and the performance of the company s securitized loan pools 
new production sources 
the company has recently begun originating manufactured housing loans and anticipates entering other lending businesses that are complementary to its current multi family mortgage lending strategy 
the company is incurring or will incur expenditures related to the start up of these businesses  with no guarantee that production targets set by the company will be met or that these businesses will be profitable 
various factors such as economic conditions  interest rates  competition and the lack of the company s prior experience in originating manufactured housing or other loans could all impact these new production sources
