results of operations the following is an explanation of significant variations from prior year results in revenues  operating expenses  other income and deductions  interest charges  and preferred and preference dividend requirements 
the results of operations of the company exclude the activities related to the missouri properties following the sales of those properties in the first quarter of for additional information regarding the sales of the missouri properties  see note revenues the operating revenues of the company are based on sales volumes and rates authorized by certain state regulatory commissions and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
future electric and natural gas sales will be affected by weather conditions  the electric rate reduction which was implemented on february   changes in the industry  changes in the regulatory environment  competition from other sources of energy  competing fuel sources  customer conservation efforts  and the overall economy of the company s service area 
electric fuel costs are included in base rates 
therefore  if the company wished to recover an increase in fuel costs  it would have to file a request for recovery in a rate filing with the kansas corporation commission kcc which could be denied in whole or in part 
the company s fuel costs represented of its total operating expenses for the years ended december  and any increase in fuel costs from the projected average which the company did not recover through rates would reduce the company s earnings 
the degree of any such impact would be affected by a variety of factors  however  and thus cannot be predicted 
compared to electric revenues were five percent higher in compared to due to higher sales in the residential and commercial customer classes as a result of colder winter and warmer spring temperatures experienced during the first six months of compared to the company s service territory experienced a increase in heating degree days during the first quarter and cooling degree days more than doubled during the second quarter of compared to the same periods in wholesale and interchange sales were also higher due to an increased number of customers 
partially offsetting this increase was abnormally cool summer weather during the third quarter of compared to and the million electric rate reduction to kge customers implemented on an interim basis on may  and made permanent on january  for more information related to electric rate decreases  see note regulated natural gas revenues increased for as compared to as a result of colder winter temperatures  higher gas costs passed on to customers through the cost of gas rider cogr  and increased as available gas sales 
regulated natural gas revenues for the last six months of were also higher due to the gas revenue increase ordered by the kcc on july  for additional information on the gas rate increase  see note as available gas is excess natural gas under contract that the company did not require for customer sales or storage that is typically sold to gas marketers 
according to the company s tariff  the nominal margin made on as available gas sales  is returned to customers through the cogr and is reflected in wholesale revenues of the company 
natural gas revenues will be significantly less in and subsequent years following consummation of the alliance with oneok see note 
non regulated gas revenues increased from approximately million to approximately million  or  for as compared to as a result of a increase in sales volumes of the company s wholly owned subsidiary westar gas marketing  inc westar gas marketing 
when the alliance with oneok is complete  westar gas marketing will be transferred to new oneok 
compared to electric revenues increased two percent in as a result of increased sales in all customer classes 
the increase is primarily attributable to a higher demand for air conditioning load during the summer months of compared to the company s service territory experienced normal temperatures during the summer of  but were more than warmer  based on cooling degree days  compared to the summer of natural gas revenues decreased in primarily as a result of the sales of missouri properties in the first quarter of the consolidated statements of income include revenues of million related to the missouri properties for the first quarter of excluding natural gas sales related to the missouri properties  natural gas revenues increased six percent due to an increase in non regulated gas revenues 
non regulated gas revenues increased from approximately million to approximately million  or  for as compared to as a result of a increase in sales volumes of westar gas marketing 
operating expenses compared to a increase in total operating expenses in compared to is primarily due to a full year of amortization of the acquisition adjustment related to the acquisition of kge in and increased fuel expense  purchased power  and natural gas purchases for electric generating stations due to wolf creek having been taken off line for its eighth refueling and maintenance outage during the first quarter of also contributing to the increases in fuel and purchased power expenses was the increased net generation due to the increase in customer demand for air conditioning load during the second quarter of the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by decreased maintenance expense and income tax expense 
compared to total operating expenses decreased two percent in compared to the decrease is largely due to the sales of the missouri properties  lower natural gas purchases resulting from lower sales  and lower fuel expense resulting from a lower unit cost of fuel used for generation 
partially offsetting this decrease were expenses related to an early retirement program 
in the second quarter of  million related to early retirement programs was recorded as an expense 
other income and deductions other income and deductions  net of taxes  decreased for the year ended december  compared to primarily as a result of a decrease in certain miscellaneous regulated gas revenues which ceased during in accordance with a kcc order 
other income and deductions  net of taxes  decreased for the twelve months ended december  compared to as a result of the gain on the sales of the missouri properties recorded in the first quarter of interest charges and preferred and preference dividend requirements total interest charges increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to due to increased interest expense on higher balances of the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities and increases in short term borrowings to finance the purchase of the investment in adt 
total interest charges increased three percent for the twelve months ended december  as compared to  primarily due to higher debt balances and higher interest rates on short term borrowings and variable long term debt 
kge merger implementation in accordance with the kcc kge merger order  amortization of the acquisition adjustment commenced august the amortization will amount to approximately million pre tax per year for years 
the company is recovering the amortization of the acquisition adjustment through cost savings under a sharing mechanism approved by the kcc 
based on the order issued by the kcc  with regard to the recovery of the acquisition premium  the company must achieve a level of savings on an annual basis considering sharing provisions of approximately million in order to recover the entire acquisition premium 
on january   the kcc fixed the annual merger savings level at million which provides complete recovery of the acquisition premium amortization expense and a return on the acquisition premium 
see note for further information relating to rate matters and regulation 
as management presently expects to continue this level of savings  the amount is expected to be sufficient to allow for the full recovery of the acquisition premium 
other information inflation under the rate making procedures prescribed by the regulatory commissions to which the company is subject  only the original cost of plant is recoverable in rates charged to customers 
therefore  because of inflation  present and future depreciation provisions are inadequate for purposes of maintaining the purchasing power invested by common shareowners and the related cash flows are inadequate for replacing property 
the impact of this ratemaking process on common shareowners is mitigated to the extent depreciable property is financed with debt that can be repaid with dollars of less purchasing power 
while the company has experienced relatively low inflation in the recent past  the cumulative effect of inflation on operating costs may require the company to seek regulatory rate relief to recover these higher costs 
environmental the company has taken a proactive position with respect to the potential environmental liability associated with former manufactured gas sites and has an agreement with the kansas department of health and environment to systematically evaluate these sites in kansas 
in accordance with the terms of the oneok agreement  ownership of twelve of the fifteen aforementioned sites will be transferred to new oneok upon consummation of the oneok alliance 
the oneok agreement limits the company s liabilities to an immaterial amount for future remediation of these sites

in order to offset these costs  the company purchased corporate owned life insurance coli policies on its employees in and on august   congress passed legislation that will phase out tax benefits associated with the and coli contracts 
the loss of tax benefits will significantly reduce the coli earnings 
the company is evaluating other methods to replace the and coli contracts 
the company also has the ability to seek recovery of postretirement and postemployment costs through the ratemaking process 
regulatory precedents established by the kcc are expected to permit the accrued costs of postretirement and postemployment benefits to be recovered in rates 
if these costs cannot be recovered in rates  the company will be required to expense the regulatory asset 
see notes and competition and enhanced business opportunities the electric and natural gas utility industry in the united states is rapidly evolving from an historically regulated monopolistic market to a dynamic and competitive integrated marketplace 
the energy policy act act began the process of deregulation of the electricity industry by permitting the ferc to order electric utilities to allow third parties to sell electric power to wholesale customers over their transmission systems 
as part of the kge merger  the company agreed to open access of its transmission system for wholesale transactions 
during  wholesale electric revenues represented approximately of the company s total electric revenues 
since that time  the wholesale electricity market has become increasingly competitive as companies begin to engage in nationwide power brokerage 
in addition  various states including california and new york have taken active steps toward allowing retail customers to purchase electric power from third party providers 
in  the kcc initiated a generic docket to study electric restructuring issues 
a retail wheeling task force has been created by the kansas legislature to study competitive trends in retail electric services 
during the session of the kansas legislature  bills have been introduced to increase competition in the electric industry 
among the matters under consideration is the recovery by utilities of costs in excess of competitive cost levels 
there can be no assurance at this time that such costs will be recoverable if open competition is initiated in the electric utility market 
the natural gas industry has been substantially deregulated  with ferc and many state regulators requiring local natural gas distribution companies to allow wholesale and retail customers to purchase gas from third party providers 
the successful providers of energy in a deregulated market will not only provide electric or natural gas service but also a variety of other services  including security 
the company believes that in the newly deregulated environment  more sophisticated consumers will continue to demand new and innovative options and insist on the development of more efficient products and services to meet their energy related needs 
the company believes that its strong core utility business provides it with the platform to offer the more efficient products and energy services that customers will desire 
furthermore  the company believes it is necessary to continuously seek new ways to add value to its customers lives and businesses 
recognizing that its current customer base must expand beyond its existing service area  the company views every person  whether in the united states or abroad  as a potential customer 
the company also recognizes that its potential to emerge as a leading national energy and energy related services provider is enhanced by having a strong brand name 
the company has been establishing its brand identity through the westar security name 
the combination of the company and adt would immediately provide an ideal brand name to capitalize on the emerging security and energy marketplaces 
although the company has been planning for the deregulation of the energy market  increased competition for retail electricity sales may in the future reduce the company s earnings from its formerly regulated business 
during  however  the company s average retail electric rates were over below the national average and continue to be competitive within the midwestern united states 
in  the company further reduced its retail rates and expects to be able to retain a substantial portion of its current sales volume in a competitive environment 
finally  the company believes that the deregulation of the energy market may prove beneficial to the company  since any potential competitive pressure in its formerly regulated business is expected to be more than offset by the nationwide markets which the company expects to enter by offering energy and security services to customers 
operating in this competitive environment will place pressure on utility profit margins and credit quality 
wholesale and industrial customers may threaten to pursue cogeneration  self generation  retail wheeling  municipalization or relocation to other service territories in an attempt to obtain reduced energy costs 
increasing competition has resulted in credit rating agencies applying more stringent guidelines when making utility credit rating determinations 
see discussion of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas in regulatory below 
the company is providing competitive electric rates for industrial expansion projects and economic development projects in an effort to maintain and increase electric load 
during  the company lost a major industrial customer to cogeneration resulting in a reduction to pre tax earnings of million annually 
this customer s decision to develop its own cogeneration project was based largely on factors unique to the customer  other than energy cost 
in light of these developments  the company is pursuing the following strategic plan maintain a strong core energy business  build a national branded presence  and become a leader in the international energy business 
in order to be better positioned for the competitive environment in the energy industry  the company is pursuing a merger with kcpl see note  seeking to acquire adt see note  planning a strategic alliance with oneok see note  and developing international power projects through its wholly owned subsidiary  the wing group see note 
regulatory on april   ferc issued its final rule on order no 
 promoting wholesale competition through open access non discriminatory transmission services by public utilities  recovery of stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities 
the company does not presently expect the order to have a material effect on its operations in large part because it is already operating in substantially the required manner due to its agreement with the kcc during the merger with kge see discussion above in competition and enhanced business opportunities 
on may   the company implemented an million electric rate reduction to kge customers on an interim basis

see note for additional information regarding rate matters 
on august   the company filed with the ferc an application for approval of its proposed merger with kcpl 
on december   the ferc issued a merger policy statement policy statement which articulates three principal factors the ferc will apply for analyzing mergers effect on competition  customer protection  and effect on regulation 
the ferc has requested the company to and pursuant to the ferc request  the company will revise its filing to comply with the specific requirements of the policy statement 
stranded costs the company currently applies accounting standards that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation  sfas  and  accordingly  has recorded regulatory assets and liabilities related to its generation  transmission and distribution operations 
in the event the company determines that it no longer meets the criteria set forth in sfas  the accounting impact would be an extraordinary non cash charge to operations of an amount that would be material 
criteria that give rise to the discontinuance of sfas include increasing competition that restricts the company s ability to establish prices to recover specific costs  and a significant change in the manner in which rates are set by regulators from a cost based regulation to another form of regulation 
the company periodically reviews these criteria to ensure the continuing application of sfas is appropriate 
based on current evaluation of the various factors and conditions that are expected to impact future cost recovery  the company believes that its net regulatory assets are probable of future recovery 
any regulatory changes that would require the company to discontinue sfas based upon competitive or other events may significantly impact the valuation of the company s net regulatory assets and its utility plant investments  particularly the wolf creek facility 
at this time  the effect of competition and the amount of regulatory assets which could be recovered in such an environment cannot be predicted 
see discussion of competition and enhanced business opportunities above for initiatives taken to restructure the electric industry in kansas 
the term stranded costs as it relates to capital intensive utilities has been defined as investment in and carrying costs associated with property  plant and equipment and other regulatory assets in excess of the level which can be recovered in the competitive market in which the utility operates 
regulatory changes  including the introduction of competition  could adversely impact the company s ability to recover its costs in these assets 
as of december   the company has recorded regulatory assets which are currently subject to recovery in future rates of approximately million 
of this amount  million represents a receivable for income tax benefits flow through to customers 
the remainder of the regulatory assets represent items that may give rise to stranded costs including debt issuance costs  deferred post employment retirement benefits and deferred contract settlement costs 
finally  the company s ability to fully recover its utility plant investments in  and decommissioning cost for  generating facilities  particularly wolf creek  may be at risk in a competitive environment 
this risk will become more significant as a result of the proposed kcpl merger as kcpl presently owns a undivided interest in wolf creek 
amounts associated with the company s recovery of environmental remediation costs and long term fuel contract costs cannot be estimated with any certainty  but also represent items that could give rise to stranded costs in a competitive environment 
in the event that the company was not allowed to recover its investment in these assets  the accounting impact would be a charge to its results of operations that would be material 
if completed  the proposed kcpl merger and the proposed strategic alliance with oneok will increase the company s exposure to potential stranded costs
