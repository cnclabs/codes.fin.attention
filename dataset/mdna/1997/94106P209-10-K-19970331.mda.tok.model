item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the company s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
certain factors that might cause such a difference are discussed herein 
see certain factors affecting future operating results 
the company was incorporated in as zoe capital corp 
and had no operations until march  on that date  the company acquired biosafe  inc  a delaware corporation  through a merger with a subsidiary of the company  and the company changed its name to biosafe international  inc biosafe is a nonhazardous solid waste management services company currently engaged in the business of rehabilitating landfills to permit their continued operation with increased capacity in an environmentally sound manner  referred to by biosafe as landfill remodeling  and landfill operation 
biosafe has developed technologies for handling of waste materials for use in landfill remodeling 
the company  in january  through an owned subsidiary  entered the waste collection business in the state of vermont as its initial step and new focus to develop fully integrated solid waste management operations in markets where it believes it can maximize utilization of company owned or operated landfills through such integration 
an integrated solid waste management services company offers disposal  collection  transfer and recycling services 
accordingly  the company is in the initial stages of investigating potential acquisitions of waste collection and transfer operations which would be integrated with current or future landfill remodeling or operation projects 
no binding agreements or understanding for any such acquisitions exist at this time and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to complete any such acquisitions 
as discussed above  biosafe is focusing its resources and activities on the development of an integrated solid waste management business 
with the implementation of subtitle d regulations as defined herein and a growing scarcity of urban center disposal sites  solid waste disposal continues to move further out from these urban centers 
the company believes that through utilization of its landfill remodeling process  it will be able to acquire and develop landfill capacity in or near urban metropolitan areas 
on an integrated basis  the company believes that this may provide a geographical and logistical competitive advantage to the extent that company s operations are more centrally located as compared to its competitors with operations extending out longer distances from disposal sites 
prior to march   biosafe had been actively developing other technologies with potential application in a number of business areas  including the manufacture of useful materials from tires and other recycled materials  contaminated soil cleanup and recycling  industrial sludge disposal  size reduction equipment design and manufacture collectively  the ancillary technologies  and major sports fantasies  inc msf  a business unrelated to the environmental industry 
since march  the company has not allocated its resources or activities to the development or commercial exploitation of the ancillary technologies or msf 
see business discontinued operations  restructuring and management change 
the company believes that the restructuring  which is now substantially complete  will allow the company to improve significantly its operating profitability in the future and has positioned the company to pursue successfully additional expansion opportunities 
see business recapitalization 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  financial position biosafe had  in cash as of december  this represented a decrease of  over december  working capital as of december  was  a decrease of  over december  this decrease was primarily due to the use of cash to fund the net loss for the year ended december   capital costs associated with landfill development projects  and the restructuring and discontinued operations costs the company incurred  partially offset by the net million in equity that the company raised on june  see notes       and to the consolidated financial statements presented in item during the year ended december   the company devoted substantial resources to various project development and related activities 
see business landfill remodeling in item and note to the consolidated financial statements presented in item additions to property and equipment  primarily related to landfill remodeling and operation activities  of  were made during the year ended december  including equipment purchase costs of  results of operations landfill revenues for the year ended december  consisted of  received from operation of the fairhaven landfill project and from the moretown landfill project which commenced operations on october  through the first quarter of  substantially all of biosafe s revenue had been attributable to the sale and licensing of biosafe s medical waste treatment technologies to biomedical waste systems  inc biomed 
on august  the company terminated its agreement with biomed in most territories as a result of biomed s failure to make required payments  see note to the consolidated financial statements presented in item in february the company entered into a licensing and services agreement with scotsafe limited scotsafe  a glasgow  scotland company for the exclusive rights to use the company s continuous feed auger medical waste processing technology in the british isles 
the company earned royalties and consulting fees of approximately  during the year ended december  from the completion of two medical waste treatment facilities by scotsafe during this period  see note to the consolidated financial statements presented in item on march   the company announced its intention to take meaningful action to conserve cash and working capital  including the restructuring of the company s operations to focus its resources and activities on its core business of landfill remodeling and operation  see note to the consolidated financial statements presented in item the company expects the restructuring and related discontinued operations to result in annual savings in excess of million 
for the year ended december   the net loss was  as compared to a net loss of  during the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  primarily consisted of  in restructuring   related to discontinued operations  the write off of  in landfill development costs  primarily consisting of the fairhaven landfill see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  an increase of  in interest expense and financing costs  partially offset by operating income from the fairhaven and moretown landfill projects  and revenues from the scotsafe agreement 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of project development activities  marketing and sales costs  salaries and benefits  and legal  accounting and other professional fees  and other administrative costs 
these costs totaled  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this represented a decrease of  which was primarily the result of the restructuring undertaken on march   see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item in addition  on march   the company entered into a two year agreement with liviakis financial communications  inc liviakis  whereby liviakis would provide ongoing assistance and consultation to the company on matters concerning mergers and acquisitions  corporate finance  investor relations and financial public relations 
as compensation for services to be rendered by liviakis  the company issued  unregistered  restricted shares of common stock 
as a result  on march   the company recorded a prepaid asset of  the company was amortizing this expense over the two years of the agreement  at a rate of  per quarter  or a total of  for the years ended december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements presented in item on december  the company terminated its consulting agreement with liviakis  as a result  the company expensed the remaining prepaid consulting fees in the amount of  year ended december  compared to year ended december  financial position biosafe had  in cash as of december  this represented an increase of  over december  working capital as of december  was  an increase of  over december  this increase was largely due to the raising of net proceeds of  in equity and long term debt during the year ended december  see notes      and to t he consolidated financial statements presented in item during the year ended december   the company devoted substantial resources to various project development and related activities 
see business landfill remodeling in item and note to the consolidated financial statements presented in item additions to project development costs  primarily related to landfill remodeling  of  were made during the year ended december  including equipment purchase costs of on august   biosafe terminated the biomedical waste systems  inc biomed technology license for biosafe s patented continuous feed autoclave cfa medical waste processing technology in most territories as a result of biomed s failure to make required payments 
accordingly  the company wrote off as uncollectible the outstanding accounts and notes receivable balances of  from biomed   see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item results of operations through the first quarter of  substantially all of biosafe s revenue had been attributable to the sale and licensing of biosafe s medical waste treatment technologies to biomed 
revenues recorded during the year ended december  consisted of  received from operation of the fairhaven landfill project which commenced on june  as well as revenues from biomed 
for the year ended december   the net loss was  as compared to net income of  during the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the write off of the accounts and notes receivable from biomed of  the increased level of the company s selling  general and administrative expenses  the nonrecurring charges of  related to the discontinuance of certain operations see note to the consolidated financial statements presented in item  and an increase of  in interest expense and financing costs  primarily related to the fairhaven landfill and the convertible debenture issued in the fourth quarter of see notes and to the consolidated financial statements presented in item  partially offset by net operating income from the fairhaven landfill project 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of project development activities  marketing and sales costs  salaries and benefits  and legal  accounting and other professional fees  and other administrative costs 
these costs totaled  for the year ended december  this represented an increase of compared to the  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was primarily associated with the development  marketing and sales of biosafe s landfill remodeling technology  the ancillary technologies  msf  and financing activities 
environmental and regulatory matters the company and its customers operate in a highly regulated environment  and in general the company s landfill remodeling projects  such as the fairhaven landfill  will be required to have federal  state and or local government permits and approvals 
see business environmental regulation 
any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial  revocation or modification under various circumstances 
in addition  if new environmental legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are interpreted or enforced differently  biosafe or its customers may be required to obtain additional operating permits or approvals 
there can be no assurance that biosafe will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements 
any delay in obtaining required permits or approvals will tend to cause delays in the company s ability to obtain bond or other project financings  resulting in increases in the company s needs to invest capital in projects prior to obtaining financing  and will also tend to reduce project returns by deferring the receipt of project revenues 
in the event that the company is required to cancel any planned project as a result of the inability to obtain required permits or other regulatory impediments  the company may lose any investment it has made in the project up to that point  and in the case of the fairhaven and moretown landfill projects  have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent possible  the company intends to conduct its operations in such a manner as to minimize the impact of environmental issues on operating results 
as a general matter  the company will seek to avoid projects in which it would be required to handle or dispose of hazardous waste  although it is prepared to consider projects that may involve some cleanup of previously existing hazardous waste  subject to controls designed to minimize exposure to risk of liability and to assure an economic return from the activity 
the company s landfill projects will involve the installation and operation of extensive environmental monitoring systems to enable the company to identify and deal with any potential environmental problems  which systems have already been implemented at the fairhaven and moretown landfill projects 
the cost of installing these systems will be included in the company s total investment in the project 
the company s contract for the fairhaven landfill project requires the town  as owner of the landfill  to pay for the ultimate cost of closing the landfill  and provides for a set aside of a part of the town s share of project revenues to establish a sinking fund for payment of closure costs  so that the company will not be required to establish any reserves for this purpose 
the company intends to implement similar arrangements for closure costs in its agreements for other landfill projects which it may enter into in the future 
the company s ownership of the moretown landfill through its subsidiary  waste professionals of vermont  inc  involves a greater degree of exposure to potential environmental liabilities than is involved with landfills operated under a management contract 
in conjunction with the acquisition of the moretown project  the company recorded million in estimated closure and post closure costs based on engineering estimates of the current condition of the landfill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements presented in item certain factors affecting future operating results initial commercialization stage  limited operating history 
to date  although biosafe has conducted significant testing of methods and processes based on its size reduction and materials handling technology  and has gained substantial experience in connection with the development and operation of the fairhaven landfill project to date  biosafe has not yet carried through a landfill remodeling project to completion 
final development and operation may be subject to engineering and construction problems such as cost overruns and start up delays resulting from technical or mechanical problems  unfavorable conditions in the equipment or labor market  or environmental permitting and other regulatory problems  as well as other possible adverse factors 
there can be no assurance that biosafe will be successful in developing and implementing commercial landfill remodeling projects  or that any such development can be accomplished without excessive cost or delay 
operating losses and accumulated deficit  uncertainty of future profitability 
biosafe had an accumulated operating deficit at december  of  prospects for future profitability are heavily dependent on the success of biosafe s landfill remodeling and operation projects  and its ability to build an integrated solid waste management company 
there can be no assurance that biosafe will generate sufficient revenue to be profitable or  if profitable  to maintain profitability in future years 
risks of limited liquidity 
the company has limited liquidity in relation to its short term capital commitments and operating cash requirements 
the company s ability to satisfy its commitments and operating requirements is dependent on a number of pending financing activities which are not assured of successful completion 
any failure of the company to obtain sufficient financing in the short run would have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operations 
future capital will be required 
biosafe will require substantial funds to complete and bring to commercial viability all of its currently planned projects 
potential environmental liability and adverse effect of environmental regulation 
biosafe s business exposes it to the risk that it will be held liable if harmful substances escape into the environment as a result of its operations and cause damages or injuries 
moreover  federal  state and local environmental legislation and regulations require substantial expenditures and impose significant liabilities for noncompliance 
see business environmental regulation in item potential adverse community relations 
the potential exists for unexpected delays  costs and litigation resulting from community resistance and concerns relating to specific projects in various communities 
unpredictability of patent protection and proprietary technology 
biosafe s success depends  in part  on its ability to obtain and enforce patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
while biosafe has been issued a us patent and certain related foreign patents on certain of its size reduction and materials handling technology with particular reference to landfill remodeling and on its cfa medical waste treatment system  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar or superior technologies  duplicate any of biosafe s processes or design around any processes on which biosafe has or may obtain patents 
in addition  it is possible that third parties may have or acquire licenses for other technology that biosafe may use or desire to use  so that biosafe may need to acquire licenses to  or to contest the validity of  such patents of third parties relating to biosafe s technology 
there can be no assurance that any license required under such patents would be made available to biosafe on acceptable terms  if at all  or that biosafe would prevail in any such context 
moreover  biosafe could incur substantial costs in defending itself in suits brought against biosafe or in bringing suits against other parties related to patent matters 
in addition to patent protection  biosafe also relies on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technology which it seeks to protect  and confidentiality agreements with its collaborators  employees and consultants 
there can be no assurance that these agreements and other steps taken by biosafe will be effective to protect biosafe s technology against unauthorized use by others 
liquidity and capital resources to date  biosafe has financed its activities primarily through the issuance of equity securities and debt  including convertible notes and common stock warrants 
as previously mentioned  from inception through december   the company has raised cumulative net proceeds of  through private placements of equity securities and the issuance of long term debt 
the company has acquired  through a joint venture in which the company has an interest  a landfill located in moretown  vermont 
the current estimated available new capacity at this landfill  excluding remodeling  is in excess of million tons 
on september  the company received its final permit from the vermont department of natural resources to commence operations at the landfill at an average of tons per day tpd 
on october  the company began operations at the landfill and is currently operating at approximately tpd 
the company anticipates the operating level of the landfill to increase to approximately tpd by the end of the second quarter of the company intends to operate the landfill at that level until the company permits and constructs its next cell  at which time the company expects to increase the operating level to full capacity 
the company s total investment in the moretown landfill project was approximately million at december  the company estimates that the total cost to wpv of completing the moretown landfill project as planned  including the cost of completing the landfill and its remodeling  including amounts invested to date  will be approximately million 
on or about march  the company expects to close a project financing of million for additional development costs and working capital requirements of the moretown landfill project from a local bank  see note to the consolidated financial statements presented in item no assurance can be given that such financing can be obtained on terms satisfactory to the company 
on july  biosafe entered into a contract with the town of fairhaven  massachusetts to remodel the town s existing acre landfill 
on june   the company commenced operations and began accepting waste at the landfill utilizing existing capacity 
on october   a major modification permit was issued by the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep including an authorization to construct and remodel the initial cell at the landfill 
since then  the company has completed remodeling and constructed an initial cell at the landfill  and on august  the company received final authorization from the dep to operate the cell under the town s current existing permit at tpd 
on november  an action was brought against various parties including the company relating to the remodeling permits at the fairhaven landfill seeking among other things to appeal the permit that had been issued for remodeling the landfill 
see legal proceedings 
on september   pursuant to the massachusetts administrative procedures act  the action was heard by a bristol county superior court judge 
as of march  a ruling has not been issued 
the company  until the outcome of this litigation is determined  has ceased making additional capital investments in this project and has operated the landfill at a reduced capacity 
based on the extensive delays and additional operating costs to the project because of this litigation and other matters  resulting in the current uncertainty of the long term economic viability of the project  the company has decided to write off its capital investment in the project through december  of  included in the  is a reserve of  for additional litigation and ongoing site construction costs 
when the litigation is resolved  the company at that time will reassess the continued feasibility of the project 
the company has been chosen to remodel additional landfills in massachusetts 
see business landfill remodeling other landfill remodeling projects 
if the company is successful in raising additional capital to meet existing commitments and to support additional capital investments  the company intends to pursue and increase its landfill remodeling and operation business  and develop an integrated solid waste management company  therefore dramatically increasing its capital requirements during the next few years 
typically  the company expects to be required to incur substantial capital costs in connection with feasibility studies  contracting  permitting and initial development  and other due diligence costs ranging from  up to million  for any such landfill remodeling or operation project in the initial phases of the project 
after completion of these initial phases  the company will generally seek to obtain project level financing to recapture a part of its initial investment from such project financing 
the company will therefore be required to commit substantial capital resources from internal sources in the case of any landfill remodeling or operation project prior to being able to obtain outside financing or to derive material operating revenues from the project 
to the extent practicable  the company seeks in its projects to retain the flexibility to defer scheduled capital investments 
for example  the total investments required for a landfill project as described above assume completion of landfill remodeling over the entire site 
the company may stage remodeling investments over an extended period of time while still collecting projected project revenues from the utilization of existing space 
in summary  the company s total investment required to complete its current landfill projects  in addition to amounts already invested as of december   will be approximately million  subject to possible cost overruns which cannot be predicted 
furthermore  feasibility studies required under the company s contracts with the towns of south hadley and buckland are expected to cost approximately million  and if these projects are determined to be feasible  substantial investments  comparable to those required for the company s other landfill remodeling projects would be required to complete the project 
the company has under discussion and negotiation a number of additional landfill remodeling or operation projects or acquisitions  and any contracts resulting from these discussions and negotiations would increase the company s capital requirements accordingly 
in addition  the company requires cash to fund its corporate staff and other overhead expenses  which may grow significantly as the company expands the scope of its operations including the development of an integrated solid waste management company 
although the company has recently begun receiving cash revenues from operation of the moretown landfill  the company will require additional financing in order to satisfy its existing and pending commitments 
the company s alternatives under consideration in this regard include the raising of additional equity or long term debt financing  see item  business recapitalization  and certain prospects for bank financing in relation to specific projects 
there can be no assurance that all or any of these financing plans and expectations will be realized 
failure of the company to obtain required financing in the short term could have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operations 
inflation biosafe does not believe its operations have been materially affected by inflation
