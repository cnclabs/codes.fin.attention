item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company for the fiscal years ended october   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto  and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
overview the company s history began on july  when bronzebase acquired of the outstanding stock of versus technology uk and certain proprietary intellectual property rights  including rights to derived channel technology and the rights to market such technology in certain countries  including the united kingdom 
bronzebase acquired the remaining versus technology uk stock in september in february  as a result of a stock exchange  bronzebase and its subsidiary  versus technology uk  became subsidiaries of numerex corp 
for financial reporting purposes  the company s results of operations prior to the date of the stock exchange are those of bronzebase and its predecessor  versus technology uk 
in july  the company completed the stock for stock acquisition of da systems 
because the shareholders of the company and da systems were substantially the same prior to the acquisition  the historical financial statements for the company have been restated to combine the company with da systems for all periods subsequent to july   the date on which common control first existed 
in july and november  the company acquired the assets comprising its digilog and dcx systems subsidiaries  respectively 
these acquisitions were cash transactions and have been recorded under the purchase accounting method 
the company generates substantially all of its net sales from the sale of various equipment  systems and software products to its customers 
products are typically shipped soon after order placement 
therefore  sales order backlog historically has not been a meaningful indicator for the company 
the company presently generates a significant amount of its net sales from product sales to an established customer base  principally british telecom  the company s largest customer  and to an established network of alarm system distributors and installers 
the company currently publishes its consolidated financial statements in british pounds sterling  the functional currency of the country in which a substantial majority of the company s net sales are presently generated 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by selected items in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
years ended october  net sales derived channel systems intrusion alarm and network management products total net sales cost of sales inventory write downs gross profit selling  general  administrative and other special charges operating income loss net income loss fiscal years ended october  and net sales decreased to pounds million for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to pounds million in fiscal derived channel product sales declined by pounds million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the principal reason for the decline was a reduction in network equipment sales in the united kingdom  which was partially offset by increased sales in the united states market 
the company believes that the network equipment coverage in the united kingdom greater than will limit the potential for significant growth in the united kingdom for network equipment sales  although subscriber terminal unit stu sales in the united kingdom have remained strong throughout fiscal intrusion alarm and network management products declined by pounds million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  principally due to the elimination of certain underperforming products from the network management product line 
cost of sales increased to pounds million for fiscal year as compared to pounds million for fiscal the inventory write downs of pounds million represented a pre tax charge recorded in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal as a result of determining certain inventory items to be obsolete due to market conditions related primarily to network management and intrusion alarm products 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in the gross profit margin was primarily due to a shift in sales mix to lower margin products as network equipment a higher margin product sales to british telecom declined  inclusion of the inventory obsolescence charge  and  in addition  certain fixed costs related to manufacturing  which did not decline in conjunction with net sales  caused a further decrease in the gross profit margin 
selling  general  administrative and other expenses increased to pounds million for fiscal as compared to pounds million for fiscal the increase was principally related to a major expansion of company s sales and marketing efforts  product development expenses and an increase in legal and other expenses 
in addition  special charges of pounds million were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal these special charges related principally to fixed and intangible asset impairment provisions for certain obsolete products and settlement of litigation 
other income and expenses increased to pounds million for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to pounds million in fiscal the increase was principally the result of interest income earned from temporary investment of cash proceeds from a public offering 
in fiscal these temporary investments earned income for a full twelve months versus fiscal the year of the public offering  when the temporary investments earned income for a partial year 
the company recorded a tax provision of pounds million for fiscal despite the pre tax loss 
certain losses arising from united states operations were not deductible in fiscal  while earnings from united kingdom operations were fully taxable 
the company expects to generate a tax benefit from these losses in future periods 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal year was 
the decrease in net sales  the inventory obsolescence charges and special charges recorded in fiscal resulted in a net loss of pounds million as compared to net income of pounds million in fiscal weighted average shares increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  principally due to the new shares issued in conjunction with a mid year public offering being outstanding for a full year in fiscal fiscal years ended october  and net sales decreased to pounds million for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to pounds million in fiscal derived channel product sales declined by pounds million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the principal reason for this decline was a reduction in derived channel network equipment and customer premises equipment stus sales in the united kingdom 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in software sales  which include revenues of pounds million recognized on a long term software development contract 
network equipment sales  which declined in the third quarter  remained below historical levels for the duration of fiscal  while stu sales recovered from third quarter levels 
management believes fiscal sales were negatively affected by a slowdown in business within the uk alarm industry which resulted in a reduction in demand for derived channel products 
the sales decline was also partially offset by a pounds million increase in the intrusion alarm and network management products category  principally due to the inclusion of a full year of network management product sales in as compared to a partial year in following the acquisition of the subsidiary engaged in this business 
cost of sales increased to pounds million for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to pounds million for fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  declined to for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to in fiscal the decrease in the gross margin was primarily due to a shift in sales mix to lower margin products  particularly in the second half of fiscal  when network equipment sales a high margin product to bt was a smaller component of the sales mix and the cost of sales related to software sales increased  as a percentage of those sales  when compared to the first half of fiscal in addition  the inclusion of network management products for a full year  which due to a highly competitive market environment do not generate gross profit margins comparable to the company s derived channel system products  also contributed to the gross profit margin decline 
selling  general  administrative and other expenses increased to pounds million for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to pounds million in fiscal selling  general  administrative and other expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased to during the fiscal year ended october  as compared to in fiscal the increase was principally related to a major expansion of the sales and marketing effort and product development primarily at dcx systems acquired in november and digilog inc acquired in july and an increase in legal and other expenses 
operating income decreased to pounds million for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to pounds million in fiscal other income and expense increased to pounds million for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to pounds million in fiscal the increase was principally the result of additional interest income generated from temporary investment of cash proceeds from a public offering 
the effective income tax rate decreased to for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to in fiscal the decrease was attributable to changes in the periodic estimation of tax liabilities 
the slight decrease in net sales and the increase in both interest income and selling  general  administrative and other expenses resulted in a net income decline of to pounds million for the fiscal year ended october   as compared to pounds million in fiscal as a result of new shares issued in conjunction with a public offering the weighted average shares outstanding increased to million for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to million in fiscal selected quarterly financial data  seasonality the following table shows certain unaudited financial data of the company for each quarter of the last two fiscal years 
this information has been prepared from the books and records of the company in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information 
in the opinion of management  all adjustments including only normal  recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included 
interim results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period

liquidity and capital resources the company is presently able to fund its operations and working capital requirements from cash flow generated by operations and the proceeds from a public offering completed in april net cash provided by operating activities decreased to pounds million for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to pounds million in fiscal the decrease from was primarily due to lower earnings  increases in both accounts receivable and inventory levels and the payment of tax obligations due on the prior year s earnings 
net cash used in investing activities decreased to pounds million for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to pounds million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower purchases of fixed asset investments and capitalized software costs 
net cash used in financing activities was pounds million for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of pounds in fiscal the principal reasons for fiscal usage was the payment of dividends and the implementation of a stock buy back program 
in fiscal net cash increased principally due to the proceeds generated from the public offering 
the company had working capital balances of pounds million and pounds million as of october  and  respectively 
the company s business has not been capital intensive and  accordingly  capital expenditures have not been material 
to date  the company has funded all capital expenditures from cash provided by operating activities 
in order to fund an expansion of its derived channel system business including an effort to increase market penetration in north america  south america  western europe and australia and to acquire complementary businesses  products or services  the company may require significantly greater capital investments than it has in the past 
presently  other than one previously announced acquisition possibility  the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company believes that its anticipated cash flow from operations  together with its available cash  including the proceeds of its public offering completed in april  and funds available through an anticipated bank credit facility  will be sufficient to finance its operating and capital requirements at least through the fiscal year ending october  cash requirements for future expansion of the company s operations will be evaluated on an as needed basis 
the company does not expect that such expansion will have a materially negative impact on the company s ability to fund its existing operations 
effect of inflation inflation has not been a material factor affecting the company s business 
in recent years  the cost of electronic components has remained relatively stable due to competitive pressures within the industry  which has enabled the company to contain its production costs 
the company s general operating expenses  such as salaries  employee benefits  and facilities costs  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
foreign currency currently  the company s functional and reporting currency is british pounds sterling because a substantial majority of the company s net sales are presently generated in the united kingdom 
although the company does not have an ongoing currency hedging program in place  it occasionally hedges its operations selectively against fluctuations in foreign currency as needed 
this occasional hedging is done primarily because a portion of the company s production costs associated with its off shore contract manufacturing are denominated in us dollars while the bulk of its net sales are in british pounds sterling 
the company uses forward us dollar contracts which have a maximum term of six months and which are not material to the company 
the company anticipates that it may utilize additional foreign currency contracts as needed to hedge against fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound sterling 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or liquidity
