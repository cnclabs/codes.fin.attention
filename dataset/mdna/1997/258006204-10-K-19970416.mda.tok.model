other items affecting the company competition the apparel industry in the united states is highly competitive and characterized by a number of multi line manufacturers such as the company and a larger number of specialty manufacturers 
the company faces substantial competition in its markets from manufacturers in both categories 
apparel industry cycles and other economic factors the apparel industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variation  with consumer spending on apparel tending to decline during recessionary periods 
a decline in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects may affect consumer spending habits  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and its financial condition 
retail environment various retailers  including some of the company s customers  have experienced declines in revenue and profits in recent periods and some have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection 
to the extent that these financial difficulties continue  there can be no assurance that the company s financial condition and results of operations would not be adversely affected 
seasonality of business and fashion risk the company s principal products are organized into seasonal lines for resale at the retail level during the spring  summer  transition  fall and holiday seasons 
typically  the company s products are designed as much as one year in advance and manufactured approximately one season in advance of the related retail selling season 
accordingly  the success of the company s products is often dependent on the ability of the company to successfully anticipate the needs of the company s retail customers and the tastes of the ultimate consumer up to a year prior to the relevant selling season 
foreign operations the company s foreign sourcing operations are subject to various risks of doing business abroad  including currency fluctuations although the predominant currency used is the us dollar  quotas and  in certain parts of the world  political instability 
any substantial disruption of its relationship with its foreign suppliers could adversely affect the company s operations 
some of the company s imported merchandise is subject to united states customs duties 
in addition  bilateral agreements between the major exporting countries and the united states impose quotas  which limit the amount of certain categories of merchandise that may be imported into the united states 
any material increase in duty levels  material decrease in quota levels or material decrease in available quota allocation could adversely affect the company s operations
