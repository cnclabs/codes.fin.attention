overview the company is the entity resulting from the combination of ensys  ohmicron and sdi 
on august   ohmicron was merged with and into sdi  with certain ohmicron stockholders and note holders receiving shares of sdi common stock 
on december   sdi was merged with and into ensys 
the surviving entity was then renamed strategic diagnostics inc each of these transactions was accounted for as a purchase transaction with sdi as the acquiring company and  therefore  the surviving company for financial reporting purposes 
as a result  the historical financial information discussed includes the results of sdi for all periods presented and the actual results of ohmicron from august  and ensys from december  ensys was formed in to develop proprietary biotechnology based test systems designed for the fast and inexpensive detection of various chemicals in soil and water samples 
ensys raised approximately million in equity financing  including approximately million from the sale of  shares of ensys common stock in its initial public offering in october since  ensys commercialized eleven immunoassay test kits and four other test kits for the detection of various environmental contaminants 
ensys marketed and sold these test kits and other associated products and services to environmental consulting and engineering firms  hazardous waste processing firms  environmental testing laboratories  and various state and federal agencies through distributors and a regionally based direct sales force in the us ensys also marketed and sold its products in europe through ensys europe limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of ensys 
in march  ensys acquired from millipore certain assets  which consisted primarily of inventory  work in process  equipment  intellectual property rights  contract rights and customer lists related to millipore s envirogard tm product line for  and  shares of ensys common stock 
ohmicron was founded in and began marketing its rapid assay registered trademark products in to the same general market and in the same fashion as previously described for ensys 
since its inception in  sdi has focused on using proprietary technology and know how to develop  manufacture  and market immunoassay test kits for applications primarily in the water quality  industrial testing and agricultural markets 
commercial operations were initiated with a contract from the company s first corporate partner to develop an immunoassay test to detect certain corrosion causing bacteria 
this product was introduced in late and sdi purchased all rights and technology related to this product in in february  sdi entered into a million research and development partnership with em industries for the development and manufacture of a line of immunoassay test kits capable of identifying and quantifying targeted priority pollutants 
the first products under this agreement were introduced in through august  these products were manufactured by sdi and marketed by em industries 
in september  em industries and sdi reached an agreement whereby the february agreement was terminated  together with em industries marketing rights thereunder  in exchange for certain specified royalty payments to em industries and shares of sdi common stock 
the marketing activities with respect to such products are now the responsibility of the company 
since  sdi has entered into research and development agreements with multiple corporate partners that have led to the introduction of various products to the water quality  industrial testing  agricultural and other markets 
these agreements generally provide that sales and marketing costs associated with a new product are borne by the corporate partner 
in addition  the company currently sells directly other products which it has developed and or acquired 
results of operations as described above  the historical financial information discussed below includes the results of operations of sdi for all periods presented and the actual results of ohmicron from august  and ensys from december  year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased to  in from  in this  increase is the result of a  increase in product related revenues and a  increase in contract and other revenues 
product related revenues increased to  in from  in this was due to overall increased sales for certain of sdi s new products  especially the first of sdi s strip assays which was introduced in mid  improved priority pollutant sales over the prior year  and product related revenues generated by tsd in the fourth quarter of subsequent to its establishment as a wholly owned subsidiary of sdi 
the product revenues do not include any revenues from any of sdi s industrial testing kits in the fourth quarter of  since sdi licensed these products to ensys in october however  they do include approximately  in product revenues from the sale of sdi inventory  at cost  to ensys in connection with the license agreement 
product related revenues are expected to significantly increase in due to the mergers completed in and the inclusion of revenues of tsd for a full year 
contract and other revenues increased to  in from  in primarily due to a  license fee from ensys and  in revenues from one time contracting of sdi personnel services by ensys and ohmicron prior to and in connection with the mergers  which was offset by a  decrease in contract revenue received from em industries in due to the completion of the em industries contract 
while research and development contracts are anticipated to continue to be integral to the company s overall business strategy  the company anticipates little or no growth in overall contract revenues over the short term 
during  a significant portion of the company s revenues will be generated from the environmental remediation industry 
historically  remediation activities have followed seasonal patterns with lower levels of activity during the period from october to march 
therefore  the company s sales in a particular quarter in may not be indicative of its revenues for any subsequent quarter during the year 
manufacturing expenses 
manufacturing expenses increased to  in from  in this  increase was primarily a result of the overall increase in product related sales during the year versus the prior year  and  to a lesser extent  the assumption of the expenses associated with the former ohmicron manufacturing facility in september due to the anticipated post merger increase in product related sales in  manufacturing expenses are expected to increase accordingly 
the company s overall gross profit margins on product related sales are anticipated to improve due to an increase in sales of its products  efficiencies gained through consolidation and the elimination of product sales at cost to em industries and ensys that occurred in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to  in from  in this decrease was primarily the result of a reduction of research and development personnel and certain salaries and related expenses  beginning in the third quarter of due to planned internal research and development activities  in addition to research and development activities performed under contracts for third parties  overall research and development expenses are anticipated to slightly increase in acquired research and development expenses 
acquired research and development expenses were  in these expenses were entirely due to the merger transactions with ohmicron and ensys  which resulted in acquired research and development expenses of  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in this increase was primarily due to the salaries and related expenses associated with the additional hiring of sales and marketing personnel required in connection with sdi s acquisition of ohmicron and the company s direct selling of its products  as well as additional accounting and administrative support personnel necessitated by the mergers and the overall growth of the company 
it is anticipated that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase from levels during due to the inclusion of a full year of the selling expenses described above in  as well as increased general and administrative expenses associated with the company being a publicly held entity in interest income and interest expense 
interest income increased  to  in from  in due to increased cash balances from a january  preferred stock financing 
due to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities received in connection with the ensys sdi merger  overall interest income is expected to significantly increase in interest expense decreased to  in from  in primarily due to the conversion of  in notes payable and related interest to preferred stock in connection with a january financing 
due to interest expense on capital lease obligations assumed in connection with the mergers  overall interest expense is expected to increase nominally in equity in income of tsd bioservices 
equity in income of the tsd bioservices partnership increased  to  in from  in this increase was primarily due to a significant increase in revenues for the partnership during versus the prior year 
in october  the tsd bioservices partnership was dissolved and its assets were liquidated  in connection with which certain of the rights and assets of the tsd bioservices partnership were distributed to tsd bioservices  inc  a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of sdi 
as a result of the dissolution and the related distribution of certain of the partnership s rights and assets  revenues earned and expenses incurred after september  associated with the rights and assets so distributed were included in the revenues and expenses of sdi through tsd bioservices  inc provision for income taxes 
due to net operating loss carry forwards  the company has made no provision for income taxes for although net operating loss carry forwards were obtained in connection with the mergers discussed above  the use of these carry forwards  if any  will be limited in future years pursuant to the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue code

contract and other revenues decreased  to  in from  in due to a reduction of contract funding by em industries to  in from  in despite the reduction in funding from em industries during the year  overall revenues decreased by only  to  in from  in due to an overall increase in product related revenues and existing or new research contract programs outside of the em industries agreement 
manufacturing expenses 
manufacturing expenses increased  to  in from  in this increase was primarily the result of an increase in overall product sales  especially the em industries product line  and the cost associated with new product introductions 
under sdi s agreement with em industries  sdi s sales of product to em industries generally provided no profit margin in  except for royalties 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased  to  in from  in this decrease was primarily the result of a reduction of research and development personnel and certain salaries in the third quarter of  coupled with decreased field trial  consulting and other research and development expenses as products previously under development were completed and transferred to manufacturing 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  to  in from  in primarily due to a reduction in selling  general and administrative personnel and certain salaries in the third quarter of interest income and interest expense 
interest income decreased to  in from  in this decrease was primarily the result of less funds available during the year due to utilization of available cash and cash equivalents for operating needs 
interest expense increased to  in from  in primarily due to interest on bridge loans from stockholders and interest expense imputed on certain warrants issued in connection with the bridge loans 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital  which consists principally of cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt investments was  at december  versus a working capital deficit  at december  this increase was due to the sdi ensys merger on december  and the conversion of notes payable held by sdi stockholders to sdi preferred stock on january  cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt investments  which consist primarily of money market instruments  us corporate obligations and other securities of agencies of the us government were  at december  versus  at december  due to the sdi ensys merger 
the company considers all of its investments to be available for sale and plans to use the proceeds from sales or maturities of these investments to finance future operating needs 
the company s investment policy is to limit exposure at any one institution 
accounts receivable and inventory balances increased in over due to the mergers occurring in the company incurred a net loss in of  after exclusion of  in charges for acquired research and development incurred in connection with the mergers versus a net loss of  during this large decrease in the net loss is attributable to additional product related revenues generated in over and to cost reduction efforts begun in late the company used  in cash to fund operations in versus  in and purchased  in property and equipment during the company believes that its current cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt investments will be sufficient to meet its funding needs for at least the next months 
however  the company s ability to meet its long term working capital and capital expenditure requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the success of the company s current and future products  the focus and direction of the company s research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  future relationships with corporate partners  government regulation and the company s marketing and distribution strategy 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet these long term requirements
