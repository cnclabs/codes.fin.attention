item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information all forward looking information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on management s current knowledge of factors affecting mamsi s business 
mamsi s actual results may differ materially if these assumptions prove invalid 
significant risk factors  while not all inclusive  are the possibility of increasing price competition in the company s market place 
the possibility of state or federal budget related mandates that reduce premiums for medicaid or medicare recipients 
the potential for increased medical expenses due to increased utilization by the company s membership 
inflation of costs in the provider community 
federal or state mandates that increase benefits 
the possibility that the company is not able to expand its service territory as planned due to regulatory delays and or inability to contract with appropriate providers 
the possibility that the company is not able to increase its market share at the anticipated premium rates 
general during the three year period ended december   mamsi and its subsidiaries the company have experienced substantial revenue growth due to increased hmo and ppo membership 
the company has achieved its membership growth by expanding its product line  which includes point of service  small group  indemnity health  hybrid products  medicaid and medicare products and through expansion into new geographic markets 
premium rates during this time have remained at or near competitive levels for the company s marketplace 
prior to  operating margins remained positive due to the control of medical expenses and  accordingly  profits and earnings per share have increased 
during  due to increasing medical utilization and continued downward competitive pressures on premium rates  the company s consolidated operating margin turned slightly negative 
the company currently anticipates that there will be increases in premium rates during and that the company s operating margins will again be positive 
this is a forward looking statement  and the company s actual operating margins may differ from management s current expectation due to risk factors which may affect either the company s revenues or expenses 
see forward looking information above for a description of these risk factors 
the company generally receives a fixed premium amount per member per month while the majority of medical expenses are variable and significantly affected by spontaneous member utilization 
even with managed care controls  unusual medical conditions can occur  such as an outbreak of influenza or a higher than normal incidence of high cost cases such as premature births  complex surgeries  or rare diseases 
as a result  the company s quarterly results can be materially effected and irregular 
however  over the longer business cycle  the company believes that its managed care control systems  underwriting procedures when allowed and network of providers will result in continued profitability 
due to the continued escalation of health care costs and the inability of many individuals to obtain health care insurance  numerous proposals relating to health care reform have been made  and additional proposals may be introduced  in the united states congress and the legislatures of the states in which the company operates or may seek to operate 
recently  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  public law  commonly called the kennedy kassebaum bill for its primary sponsors  was enacted 
this bill establishes certain federal requirements for large group  small group  and individual health benefit plans  and applies not only to insurers and hmos but also to erisa plans 
kennedy kassebaum is intended to make coverage more portable and available by limiting pre existing condition requirements  providing special enrollment periods for employees who lose other coverage or whose family status changes  prohibiting group plans from denying an individual coverage or charging a higher premium based on the individual s health status or history  and by guaranteeing coverage availability and renewability in certain circumstances in the small group and individual markets 
kennedy kassebaum also allows for the establishment of medical savings accounts  increases the penalties for health care fraud and abuse  and calls for standardized health care information in order to reduce administrative costs 
the effect of kennedy kassebaum will differ from state to state 
in the group market  state laws remain in effect unless they prevent the application of the new federal requirements  and in the individual market  state law will govern if the health and human services secretary determines that it provides an acceptable alternative mechanism to the federal requirement 
this means that in those states like maryland  where state reforms have already been enacted  the legislation may have little  if any  effect in the small group market  but may have some effect on the individual market 
in other states  the legislation may have a greater effect 
state legislatures and regulators are hurriedly trying to understand the requirements and implications of the law 
most of the provisions of kennedy kassebaum will take effect on july   but some  like the provisions pertaining to medical savings accounts  take effect earlier and some  like administrative simplification  take effect later 
in recent years  state legislatures in the company s service area have been active in health care reform legislation targeted at the small group market  ie  usually for groups of to employees 
this small group reform is now in place in maryland  virginia  delaware and north carolina  but not in pennsylvania  washington  dc or west virginia 
although different in many of the details  this type of legislation generally requires all hmos and insurers that offer small group coverage to accept all small employers who apply for coverage and to guarantee coverage to their employees seeking coverage regardless of their health status 
the legislation also requires renewal of these small group employer plans  limits rate renewal increases  mandates adjusted community rating and eliminates pre existing condition limitations either entirely or within a short period of time  usually six months 
the company believes that the current political environment in which it operates will result in continued legislative scrutiny of health care reform and may lead to additional legislative initiatives 
the company is unable to predict the ultimate impact upon the company of any federal or state restructuring of the health care delivery or health care financing systems  but such changes could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial condition of the company 
the district of columbia  which has not previously regulated hmos  enacted legislation effective july  providing for regulatory oversight similar to that currently provided by other states 
the company does not anticipate any significant negative impact on its operations because of the new regulatory oversight in the district of columbia 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december results of operations consolidated net income loss of the company was  and  in and  respectively 
net earnings loss per share was 
in as compared to in the reduction in earnings is primarily attributable to a significant increase in the medical loss ratio for commercial products  continuing losses in the company s medicare product and lower earnings from the company s medicaid products 
the medical loss ratio increased principally due to increased member utilization 
the company has priced its health products competitively in order to increase its membership base and thereby enhance its strategic position in its marketplace 
the company currently has one of the largest hmo and managed care enrollments and also the largest network of contract providers of medical care in its service area which includes the entire states of maryland and delaware  the district of columbia  most counties and cities in virginia  and certain areas of west virginia  north carolina and pennsylvania 
revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately million or percent over the year ended december  a percent increase in net average hmo and indemnity enrollment resulted in an increase of approximately million in health premium revenue while the average monthly premium per enrollee  combined for all products  remained approximately the same 
management believes that commercial health premiums should increase over the next twelve months as new and renewing groups are charged higher premium rates due to legislatively mandated benefit enhancements and general pricing increases initiated by the company 
medicare premiums should increase due to the company initiated reduction in certain lower rate medicare service areas and the january increase in overall medicare premiums paid by the government 
this is a forward looking statement 
see forward looking information above for a description of the risk factors that may affect health premiums per member 
the company has implemented increased premium rates across essentially all of its commercial products which began to take effect in july  as the company s contracts are generally for a one year period  increased pricing cannot be initiated until a contract reaches its renewal date 
therefore  price increases cannot be made across the company s membership at the same time 
additionally  the company received an approximate percent premium rate increase in its virginia medicaid program and an approximate percent increase in its maryland medicaid program  both effective july  management believes that the commercial premium rate increases will have the effect of slowing down the company s future membership growth 
in addition  management reevaluated premium reimbursement rates with regard to its medicare and medicaid participation and reduced or eliminated certain service areas 
specifically  effective january   counties and cities were eliminated from the company s medicare service area 
also effective january   the company no longer participates in the mandated portion of the virginia medicaid program which serves medicaid eligibles in the tidewater area of virginia 
in addition  the company has withdrawn from the maryland medicaid program due to changes to premium and benefit levels and other requirements made by the state of maryland after it obtained an waiver and became a mandated state 
as the company is the largest provider of managed care medicaid in maryland  the company will continue to provide services in until an orderly transition can be accomplished 
the company will be compensated during the transition period at a rate higher than the mandated program allows but lower than historical reimbursement 
in  the company became licensed to serve portions of the medicaid populations in west virginia and north carolina 
the company s future membership growth depends on several factors such as relative premium prices and product availability  future increases or decreases in the company s service area  increased competition in the company s service area and changes in state mandated enrollment in medicaid hmo programs in which the company participates 
enrollment may also decrease if the company determines that premium reimbursement rates related to certain state medicaid programs and the medicare program are inadequate which might cause the company to voluntarily withdraw from participation 
service revenue from non mamsi affiliated entities earned by the company s home health care subsidiaries contributed million in revenue in as compared to million for this increase is the result of increasing business volume for these subsidiaries  particularly in the home infusion area  which is largely offset by an increasing relative percentage of business conducted for mamsi hmo and indemnity members which is eliminated in consolidation 
revenue from life and short term disability products contributed million in as compared to 
million in during the second quarter of  the company received a letter from the health care financing administration hcfa proposing a marketing sanction in connection with the administration of its medicare product  asserting that the company did not comply with certain hcfa requirements 
the company contested the assertions made by hcfa and was informed early in november  that  after reviewing the company s response to the allegations  hcfa will not pursue the imposition of sanctions as proposed in their initial letter 
in  mamsi invited the national committee for quality assurance ncqa  a private  non profit organization  to evaluate the company s methodologies in an effort to receive ncqa accreditation 
ncqa accreditation is a voluntary process 
the company did not meet certain of ncqa s criteria and  therefore  did not receive ncqa accreditation 
mamsi believes that it has adopted methodologies and programs designed to respond to concerns and questions raised in ncqa s assessment 
the company currently believes that  based on its success with large group sales since the denial of accreditation  the failure to receive ncqa accreditation has not had a significant adverse effect on its business or financial condition to date although certain large group customers have frozen their enrollment in mamsi until accreditation is obtained 
the company believes that increasing public awareness of the various accreditation processes will potentially cause them to have more significance in the purchase and enrollment decisions which could be detrimental to the company if ncqa accreditation is not obtained 
the company has been reviewed again for accreditation in december of although the company believes that the likelihood of ncqa accreditation is good  there can be no assurance that accreditation will be received or that mamsi will not experience disenrollment if accreditation is not ultimately received 
the company has implemented the health plan and employer data and information set hedis which represents a core set of performance measures developed by ncqa to serve the employer as a purchaser 
medical expenses as a percentage of health premium revenue medical loss ratio increased to percent in as compared to percent for and  on a per member per month basis  medical expenses increased percent 
this significant increase is due to a combination of factors including lower commercial premiums charged due to competitive forces  higher than expected utilization by commercial members  cost increases due to legislatively mandated benefits and extremely high medical expenses related to the company s medicare enrollment 
the medical cost factor of total medical costs may stabilize or only increase slightly from the current level over the next twelve months due to continuing efforts by the company to implement product specific cost containment controls  expanded activity in specialized subrogation areas and claims review for dual health coverage  the adoption of regionalized and product specific fee maximums for health services  and the identification and possible termination of certain providers and specialists from the delivery network following a continuing  intensified peer review analysis 
additionally  the company has greatly expanded its initial health assessments of new medicare members after they have enrolled and also increased its medicare case management personnel 
the company has also reduced the service area in which it offers its medicare risk plan 
this reduction in service area  effective january   primarily targets those areas where the current medicare reimbursement is insufficient to support the company s participation 
these initiatives should help to control and reduce the cost of high cost cases which are driving the excessive medical loss ratio in the medicare line of business 
the overall medical loss ratio is expected to stabilize and decrease slowly from the current level over the next twelve months due to the combined effects of expanded utilization and case management efforts  continuing cost containment efforts  increases in health premiums  and the continuing analysis of expansion area and product line profitability 
the statements in this paragraph regarding future utilization rates  cost containment initiatives  total medical costs and future increases in health premiums per member are forward looking statements 
see forward looking information above for a description of risk factors that may affect medical expenses per member and the medical loss ratio 
the administrative expense ratio for increased to percent as compared to percent for this increase is due primarily to increased salaries and expenses in certain administrative areas of the company  including utilization management and customer service departments  as well as additional sales expenses in new expansion areas in management believes that the administrative expense ratio will exceed the current level over the next year due to the continued expansion of utilization management and other personnel 
management s expectations concerning the administrative expense ratio are forward looking statements 
the administrative expense ratio is affected by changes in health premiums per member  development of the company s expansion areas and increased administrative activity related to business volume 
investment income increased million or percent primarily due to an increase of million in realized gains on sales of marketable equity securities 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences that  in management s opinion  are more likely than not to be realized in the current or future periods 
the company s history of operating revenue and income growth  and expectation of future operating income  provides strong positive evidence that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for net operating loss carry forwards generated by certain subsidiaries that are not deductible on a consolidated tax return 
management intends to continue to monitor the realizability of deferred tax assets in light of future circumstances and assess the reasonableness of the valuation allowance 
the net margin rate decreased from percent in to 
percent in this decrease is primarily due to the increase in the medical loss ratio 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december results of operations consolidated net income of the company was  and  in and  respectively  an increase of percent 
earnings per share increased percent from in to in the increase in earnings is primarily attributable to an increase in membership  increased investment income from higher invested balances and realized gains  and a reduction in per member per month medical expenses principally due to a reduction in the return of physician withhold  partially offset by a reduction in premiums per enrollee and an increase in administrative expenses principally due to additions to the company s internal sales force  expansion into new geographic territories and the operations of the home health care subsidiaries that were purchased in late revenue in increased percent to million from million in a percent increase in net average hmo and indemnity enrollment resulted in an increase of approximately million in health premium revenue and a percent decrease in average premiums per hmo and indemnity enrollee reduced health premium revenue by approximately million 
health premiums per enrollee declined due to the combined effects of an increasing relative percentage of virginia medicaid hmo members with lower per enrollee revenues and the volatility of revenues from groups with alternative funding arrangements ie  revenues vary in a more direct way with medical expense coupled with management s plan to price its commercial products competitively 
medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenue medical loss ratio increased to percent in as compared to percent in  principally due to a decrease in average premiums per enrollee and also higher than anticipated medical expenses in the company s medicare risk product 
on a per member per month basis  medical expenses declined approximately 
percent over the same period due to a reduction in the return of physician withhold  the effect of which was mostly offset by higher member utilization  particularly in the medicare product 
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue administrative expense ratio increased to percent in as compared to percent in administrative expenses increased percent  from million in to million in the increase in the administrative expense ratio is primarily attributable to expenses of the company s home health care subsidiaries  which were purchased in late  the company s territorial expansion into additional service areas within currently served states as well as into the new states of north carolina  south carolina  and pennsylvania  the continued implementation of its plan to significantly increase its employee sales force and the higher costs of administering the medicaid product  which became a more significant line of business for the company in effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities statement no 

statement no 
requires that investments in all debt securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair values be classified into categories  which then establish the appropriate accounting treatment 
at january   the company s entire short term investment portfolio was classified as available for sale and  as a result  the net unrealized gain associated with these securities of million  net of tax  was recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
also on the same date  the company s statutory deposits  which consist of investments held in custodial accounts by state regulatory agencies  were classified as held to maturity and will continue to be carried at amortized cost 
the net margin rate decreased from percent in to percent in this decrease is primarily due to lower premium rates on certain products and increased administrative expense 
liquidity and capital resources the company s business is not capital intensive and the majority of the company s expenses are payments to health care providers  which generally vary in direct proportion to the health premium revenues received by the company 
although medical utilization rates vary by season  the payments for such expenses lag behind cash inflow from premiums because of the lag in provider billing procedures 
in the past  the company s cash requirements have been met principally from operating cash flow and it is anticipated that this source  coupled with the company s operating line of credit  will be sufficient in the future 
the company s cash and short term investments decreased from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to purchases of mamsi common stock under the company s stock repurchase program  the company s net loss and the acceleration of claims payments 
accounts receivable increased from million at december  to million at december  this million increase is primarily due to the increase in membership during combined with a lower than normal balance in receivables at december  due to a higher relative volume of payments made by employer groups during the last month of the year 
prepaid expenses  advances and other current assets increased from million at december  to million at december   principally due to estimated tax refunds for net operating loss carrybacks available for certain mamsi subsidiaries and other reductions in estimated tax liabilities related to the net loss for the year plus certain other tax deductions not related to book income 
statutory deposits decreased from million at december  to million at december  due to the release by state regulatory authorities of certain deposits related to an affiliated hmo that was merged into md ipa in short term investments are marked to market at the end of every quarter and the resulting unrealized gain or loss is reflected in the ending stockholders equity balance 
accordingly  stockholders equity at december  reflects an unrealized gain of 
million  net of tax  on the company s short term investments primarily due to the impact of falling interest rates on the market value of the company s debt securities 
medical claims payable increased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to increased membership  increased member utilization and related claims accruals 
additional paid in capital increased from million at december  to million at december   principally due to the establishment of a stock compensation trust 
this trust is used to provide shares of the company s stock to meet its stock option plan obligations 
amounts recorded for treasury stock increased in by approximately million due to stock purchases under the company s stock repurchase program 
the company currently has access to total revolving credit facilities of million  which is used to provide short term capital resources for routine cash flow fluctuations 
at december   approximately million was drawn against these facilities 
following is a schedule of the short term capital resources available to the company december in thousands cash and cash equivalents   short term investments   working capital advances to maryland hospitals   total available liquid assets   credit line availability   total short term capital resources   certain mamsi subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by state insurance departments must notify state regulators before the payment of any dividends to mamsi and  in certain circumstances  must receive positive affirmation prior to such payment 
the company does not perceive these requirements to be a significant restriction on the subsidiaries ability to pay appropriate future dividends to the parent company 
the company does not anticipate any adverse impact on future liquidity due to medical malpractice issues because the company carries substantial professional liability insurance 
the company believes that cash generated from operations along with its current liquidity and borrowing capabilities are adequate for both current and planned expanded operations 
certain capital expenditures will be made over the next year to enhance the company s computer systems  to establish additional sales offices and to make necessary improvements to existing administrative offices
