the comparable period of included the same number of days for the southern california  wisconsin  and northern california faires  but did not include the new york or virginia faires 
the new york faire was acquired on february   and although accounted for as a pooling of interest and therefore included in the fiscal year ended march   the entire twelve month results of operations for the calendar year ended december  were reflected in the operating results for the january  through march  quarter and not in the nine month period ended december  the virginia renaissance faire  which was under construction as of december   did not generate any revenues during the nine month period ended december  thus  these financial statements include the results of five operating faires for the period in  but only three faires for the same period in revenue increased from  for the nine month period ended december  to  for the nine month period ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase in revenues resulted from the additional operations of the virginia and new york faires for the period ended december   as compared to the same period of the increased revenues from the new faires were partially offset by a decrease in revenues for the southern california faire as compared to the same period of unusually inclement weather in virginia  new york and southern california reduced the expected revenues from faire operations 
the virginia faire  as is typical of new faires  operated at a loss in  its first year of operation  and is expected to incur a small operating loss in the faire season 
during the season the bristol renaissance faire revenues increased 
this was the eighth consecutive year that attendance increased at this faire 
faire operating expenses expenses directly related to faire operations  such as rent  grounds maintenance  contract services  contract entertainment  food  beverage and merchandise costs increased  or  from  in the period to  in the period

the company recognized as expense in the nine month period ended december    of costs to be incurred in  which costs are the result of changing conditions at the company s northern california faire  which became apparent to the company in other operating expenses all other general and administrative expenses of the company increased  or  from  in to  in this increase is primarily the result of operating expenses resulting from the two additional faires  and also greater overhead costs at each faire site plus other corporate activities which support faire operations and pursue new ventures 
as a result of the foregoing  net operating income before interest charges and other income decreased  from  in to a loss of  in a decrease in interest income from  in to  in resulted from the substantially decreased cash position of the company throughout the period as compared to the same period of a increase in interest expense from  in to  in resulted from a large increase in the company s borrowing levels throughout the period as compared to combined net interest expense interest expense less interest income reflected an increase of  for the period  from  in to  in miscellaneous expenses decreased from  in to  in combining net operating income with other income resulted in a  decrease in net income before taxes  from income of  in the period to a loss of  in the period

results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal comparisons of the fiscal year ended march  with the fiscal year ended march  include creative faires  ltd 
owner of the new york renaissance faire acquired february  the acquisition has been accounted for as a pooling of interests  which means that the financial results of creative faires  ltd 
have been retroactively merged into those of the company 
accordingly  the company s results of operations for fiscal and fiscal include the results of creative faires 
because the company s fiscal year previously ended on march and creative faires fiscal year ended on december  the income statements of creative faires for the fiscal years ended december  and december  have been consolidated into the company s income statements for the fiscal years ended march  and march   respectively 
results of operations for creative faires  ltd 
includes three crafts shows and a halloween forest of fear in addition to the new york renaissance faire  although the faire represents most of its revenue 
the results of operations of the company for the fiscal year ended march  reflect the nineteen day run of the los angeles faire  the eighteen day run of the wisconsin faire  the fifteen day run of the san francisco faire  and the seventeen day run of the new york faire 
the comparable period of fiscal included the same number of days for los angeles  wisconsin and new york faires  but included an additional three days for the san francisco faire 
the virginia renaissance faire  under construction as of march   did not generate any revenues during fiscal thus  these financial statements include the results of four operating faires and one faire under construction during fiscal  as against four operating faires during fiscal as a further note  as a result of the acquisition of the los angeles faire on april   the comparable figures for the fiscal year do not reflect advance ticket sales and certain prepaid expenses of the los angeles faire which were recognized by the prior owner 
revenue increased modestly from  for the fiscal year ended march  to  for the fiscal year ended march   an increase of  or 
during fiscal beverage operations for the los angeles and san francisco faires were handled by an outside contractor  and accordingly only the fee earned from that contractor was reported as revenue  whereas in fiscal the company ran the beverage operation itself and recorded all revenue 
faire operating expenses expenses directly related to faire operations  such as rent  grounds maintenance  contract services  contract entertainment  food  beverage and merchandise costs increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase is partially due to the inclusion of beverage costs for the los angeles and san francisco faires  which were not reported during the previous period when handled by an outside contractor  plus higher overall costs related to faire operations 
the gross profit  representing operating income from faire operations before overhead expenses  decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease is attributable to the shorter run of the san francisco faire in fiscal and growing operating costs which were not offset by increased attendance 
operating expenses year round operating costs and corporate overhead increased  or  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal of these amounts  salaries increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  representing a modest expansion of staffing levels company wide 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase is largely the result of the company s increased investment in property and equipment for the expanded wisconsin faire  as well as investment in furniture and equipment for the corporate office  which moved to new quarters in april substantial investment in buildings and improvements to the virginia property were not subject to depreciation in fiscal  because at march  the virginia faire had not yet opened 
under accounting rules those assets categorized on the balance sheet as construction in progress were not yet depreciable 
advertising expenditures increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal other operating expenses all other general and administrative expenses of the company increased  or  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal this increase is the result of greater overhead costs at each faire site plus other corporate activities which support faire operations and pursue new ventures 
for example  during the fiscal year  approximately  was spent developing new products and distribution opportunities 
second  approximately  in product design costs  which had been capitalized during the fiscal year  had to be expensed when changing circumstances required a different accounting treatment of that transaction 
third  approximately  in expenses were incurred searching for and negotiating for the rights to new sites for the los angeles and san francisco faires 
management believes that those faires have the potential to be more profitable once they are located on long term sites with permanent structures  since the substantial costs of re establishing the faires each season will be eliminated and also  the opportunity for revenue enhancement will improve in conjunction with additional improvements to the property 
fourth  the company expensed approximately  in overhead costs during construction of the new site in virginia  including such costs as salaries  office rent and overhead costs related to overseeing construction 
as a result of the foregoing  net operating income before interest charges and other income decreased  from  for fiscal to a loss of  for fiscal a increase in interest income from  in fiscal to  in fiscal resulted from the investment of cash proceeds from the january stock offering 
offsetting this was a increase in interest expense from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was due to a new  mortgage and  note on the virginia property  plus a larger mortgage on the wisconsin property 
combining interest income with interest expense resulted in an increase in net interest expense from  in fiscal to  in fiscal miscellaneous expenses primarily loss on sale of assets of  in fiscal changed to  in miscellaneous income rental income and vendor refunds in fiscal combining net operating income with other income resulted in a  decrease in net income before taxes  from income of  for fiscal to a loss of  in fiscal since the company incurred a net loss for the fiscal year  it applied that loss against taxable income during the previous fiscal year  resulting in a credit of  in taxes previously booked

during the fiscal year  a year of net income  income tax expense of  was incurred 
net income to common stockholders decreased  from  in fiscal to a loss of  for fiscal net income to common stockholders for fiscal is net of  paid in dividends on preferred stock

the company has historically relied upon various revolving credit facilities to meet its working capital requirements during this period 
at december   the company had outstanding  in short term line of credit borrowings which was the maximum amount available under the lines and did not  therefore  have any unused credit available for the faire season 
subsequent to year end  the company has entered into a loan workout agreement with respect to the lines of credit which will permit the company to pay these lines from operations 
since december   the company has also raised  of working capital through issuance of convertible debt to an officer of the company and a related party and obtained a commitment for  of working capital from the sale of convertible notes to a number of private investors 
the notes are to be secured by a mortgage on the company s kenosha  wisconsin faire site and will be convertible into shares of common stock of the company at a maximum of per share 
management believes that the company needs to raise an additional  to fund the opening of the faire season 
in addition  management believes that the company should raise additional working capital in order to more adequately fund its operations 
the company is pursuing various funding alternatives 
however  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to the company or  if available  available on terms acceptable to the company
