item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the company s revenues are derived from the production and sale of its proprietary grain belt  pig s eye  landmark  yellow belly  and brewers cave beers  its contract production of beers and other beverages for other companies and its production of proprietary beers for sale under different brand names by private label customers 
results of operations the table below sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of net sales represented by items included in the company s statement of operations year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit advertising sales and marketing administrative provision for doubtful accounts operating income loss interest expense income tax benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to net sales for were  a decrease from the net sales reported for of  total barrels sold in were  compared to  barrels in resulting in a decrease in barrelage sales 
due to product mix and because the company s contract customers purchase all or part of their own packaging materials  the percentage decrease in barrels can vary from the percentage decrease in net sales 
sales of proprietary brands increased from barrelage of  to barrelage sales of  the improvement was attributable to the continuing increase in sales of grain belt premium  the company s leading brand 
in addition  the introduction of the lemon flavored malt ale yellow belly during the year accounted for part of the increase  while the company s pig s eye brand declined slightly 
the company anticipates that in sales of its proprietary products will continue to increase supported by its marketing efforts  bolstered by the increased sales of its products introduced in yellow belly and brewers cave  and additional new products being brought to the market in proprietary sales for were also adversely affected when its two major distributors sold their businesses as of september  these transactions and the resultant consolidation of distributors in the fourth quarter of caused proprietary sales to fall below company forecasts for and the annual percentage increase to decline from levels attained during the first six months of the year 
the company believes the successor distributors are well positioned to further expand the company s sales in the future 
export sales decreased from  barrels in to  barrels in the decrease was attributable to a shift in the foreign exchange rate and the imposition of impractical product coding requirements on a major export account 
the company anticipates that it will experience an increase in export sales during based upon its existing accounts 
because the company sells its export brands at prices lower than domestic sales  these export sales are a lower percentage of net sales than a percentage of barrelage 
sales from brewing agreements and contract packaging decreased  barrels in total from  in to  barrels in for a decrease 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the loss of the company s largest contract account in  pete s brewing company  which accounted for  barrels of sales in excluding the impact of the pete s brewing company sales  other contract sales increased  barrels or from  barrels in to  barrels in this increase reflects the company s efforts to rebuild contract sales after the loss of the pete s account 
the company continues to replace this volume from existing accounts and the addition of new contracts 
while net sales decreased in  costs of goods sold only decreased from million to million 
the smaller percentage decrease in cost of goods sold versus the decrease in net sales was attributable to the fixed level of plant operating overhead which remained relatively stable even though the third and fourth quarter sales fell short of company expectations 
therefore  the company experienced a decline in its gross margin from in to in principally from a shortfall in sales

the company incurred losses in and  its first two years of operations  totaling approximately million 
these losses were used  in part  to offset  and taxable income 
the company has million net operating loss carryforwards from the loss period that can be utilized to offset future taxable income to an approximate annual limitation of  these carryforwards expire if not utilized by the year ended the company s approximate tax loss of million in can be used to offset future taxable income without limitation  this carryforward expires in if not used prior to that time 
during  the company operated significantly below its production capacity 
therefore  in order to attain a profitable level of operations  the company must increase its sales and production volume 
management continues to seek out opportunities to increase sales volume 
during and early  the company entered into agreements with several new contract customers 
certain of these new accounts provided sales volume in however  because most of these accounts were added in late and early  their full impact will not be realized until fiscal in addition  management anticipates growth in both its proprietary products and export sales

this payment was netted against cost of goods sold and was used by the company to cover costs incurred in the wind down of the pete s contract 
operating expenses were  greater in than of this amount advertising expenses were  less in than in reflecting a restructured advertising campaign for pig s eye beer and a re focused grain belt premium campaign to capitalize on receipt of the gold medal at the october great american beer festival
