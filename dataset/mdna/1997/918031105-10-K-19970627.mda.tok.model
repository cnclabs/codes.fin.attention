fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
consolidated revenues increased  due to a increase in revenues from north american flowmole operations and a increase in north american cablecure revenue  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from the company s international operations 
total revenues from north american operations in fiscal were million 
revenues from electric utilities  gas utilities and telephone companies constituted  and  respectively  of such fiscal revenues 
revenues from electric utilities  including cablecure revenues  increased substantially in fiscal  primarily due to growth from test  treat or replace customers 
revenues from gas utilities also increased substantially in fiscal due to expansion of the company s ability to offer traditional trenching services and full service installations  including gas pipe fusion 
flowmole revenues in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal and include both revenue from trenchless and conventional trenching methods of installation and replacement of underground utilities 
flowmole operations accounted for and of consolidated revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in revenue from flowmole operations in fiscal was primarily a result of increased demand for the company s services 
the company s test  treat or replace service option has generated significant increases in replacement work from electric utility customers who were not major flowmole customers in prior years 
in addition  the company has significantly increased its capabilities to perform gas pipe fusion and to perform installation and replacement services using conventional trenching methods 
as a result  revenues from gas utilities contributed a significant portion of the increase in flowmole revenues 
the company s average price per foot installed or replaced increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting the increased complexity of work performed by the company 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company did not experience the severe winter weather throughout the eastern united states that adversely affected the company s flowmole revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal consequently  flowmole revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  compared to million in the same period of fiscal as a result of the above factors  the weighted average number of fully utilized flowmole drilling systems in operation during fiscal was  compared to in fiscal cablecure revenues in north america increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the total cable injected in north america increased to over million feet in fiscal  compared to million feet in fiscal much of this increase is attributable to increased revenues from customers choosing a test  treat or replace contract 
under such a contract  the company is assigned certain spans of cable which are tested for splices or corrosion  and either injected with cablecure fluid or replaced by the company s flowmole crews 
most cable can be injected  and the company attempts to schedule the replacement portions of such work in a manner that affords maximum productivity 
revenue from the company s international operations decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal total revenues from equipment sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company substantially sold its inventory of new equipment in the first half of fiscal  and its ability to market new equipment for sale will continue to be limited until newly manufactured equipment is obtained later in fiscal revenue from service operations in europe increased fiscal  partially offsetting the decline in revenue from equipment sales 
gross profit 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenues increased to of total revenues in fiscal  compared to of total revenues in fiscal the fixed costs of flowmole operations are a significant component of total costs  and therefore gross profit as a percentage of revenue improved in fiscal due to higher revenue levels 
also  the company restructured its cablecure hiring and training practices in fiscal  and crews began to achieve a high level of improved productivity  measured in terms of feet injected per day  during the second quarter of fiscal  which served to boost profit in the second half of fiscal and in all of fiscal the company experienced an increase in gross profit percentage in its international operations in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a change in the mix of revenues 
the company generates a higher margin on international services and international spare parts sales than on sales of equipment 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal research and engineering expenses increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the company s restructuring announced on april  which allowed the elimination of a number of corporate staff positions and a million reduction in overhead expenses 
the company achieved its cost reduction objectives 
the savings were partially offset by higher royalty payments to dow corning under the company s exclusive cablecure license agreement 
due to the growth in revenues and gross profit from worldwide cablecure operations  the provisions for such royalty payments increased to approximately  in fiscal provisions for such payments amounted to approximately  in fiscal the higher research and engineering expense levels in fiscal reflect the prototype testing of the series g drill and enhanced electronics guidance systems 
operating income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company reported operating income of  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to an operating loss of  or of revenues  in fiscal other income and expense 
net interest income expense was income of  in fiscal  compared to an expense of  in fiscal  due to lower levels of borrowing on the company s line of credit during fiscal other income expense  net includes foreign exchange losses  resulting primarily from operations in germany  which increased in fiscal compared to fiscal income tax benefit 
the company reported a provision in fiscal to provide a valuation allowance against the full amount of its net deferred tax assets 
the company had no federal or state income tax provision related to united states operations in fiscal due to realizing the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets 
in addition  the company reported an  income tax benefit in fiscal due to additional refunds from prior years generated as a result of a favorable conclusion of an internal revenue service examination of its fiscal federal tax return 
also  the company recognized  in tax refunds associated with fiscal tax losses incurred by its european subsidiary 
on an ongoing basis  the company would typically expect an effective income tax rate of approximately due to state income taxes and the impact of nondeductible expenses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item net income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company reported net income of  in fiscal  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
consolidated revenues decreased  due to a decrease in revenues from flowmole drilling activities in north america offset by a increase in north american cablecure revenue and a increase in revenue from the company s international operations 
flowmole revenues in fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal flowmole operations accounted for and of consolidated revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue from flowmole operations in fiscal was primarily a result of a planned crew reduction which occurred between april and july  in addition to the continued impact of competition on pricing and on the company s ability to obtain work 
as a result of the crew reductions  the company experienced periods of limited capacity during much of fiscal  and did not rebuild its crew count to the prior year level until november in addition  severe winter weather throughout the eastern united states adversely affected the company s flowmole revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal flowmole revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  compared to million in the same period of fiscal as a result of the above factors  the weighted average number of fully utilized flowmole drilling systems in operation during fiscal was  compared to in fiscal cablecure revenues in north america increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the total cable injected in north america increased to million feet in fiscal  compared to approximately  feet in fiscal much of this increase is attributable to increased revenues from customers choosing a test  treat or replace contract 
revenue from the company s international operations increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  due to increased revenues from service operations and spare parts sales in asia 
increased sales of equipment in asia offset decreased sales of equipment in europe 
total revenues from equipment sales was unchanged at million in both fiscal and fiscal gross profit 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to of total revenues in fiscal  compared to of total revenues in fiscal gross profit from flowmole operations was adversely affected by the lower revenue levels and increasing customer requirements for additional ancillary services under drilling contracts 
the fixed costs of flowmole operations are a significant component of total costs  therefore gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined significantly in fiscal this effect was partially offset by higher gross profit levels from increased cablecure activities 
the company restructured its cablecure hiring and training practices in fiscal  and crews began to achieve a high level of improved productivity  measured in terms of feet injected per day  during the second quarter of fiscal  which served to boost gross profit 
the company experienced an increase in gross profit percentage in its international operations compared to fiscal the company generates a higher margin on international services and international spare parts sales  so the increased mix of services and spare parts revenue aided overall gross profit 
average profit margins on equipment sales improved slightly as well 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal research and engineering expenses decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to having a full year of expenses in fiscal from sales and administrative positions added during fiscal  as well as a  provision for severance and outplacement benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decreased research and engineering costs in fiscal reflect the completion of the company s fiscal efforts to refine and improve its series f drill and fpu  as well as a reduction in the level of contracted research expenses performed in connection with its cablecure activities 
operating income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company reported an operating loss of  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to an operating loss of  or of revenues  in fiscal other income and expense 
net interest income expense was an expense of  in fiscal  compared to income of  in fiscal  due to higher levels of borrowing on the company s line of credit during fiscal in fiscal  the company reported an expense of  due to its share of the startup losses of its environmental joint venture  flowmole environmental services corporation fesc 
in fiscal  the company reported a gain of  from the operations of fesc  which ceased operations in december see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item income tax benefit 
the company reported a provision of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal to provide a valuation allowance against the full amount of its net deferred tax assets 
excluding this charge  the company s income tax benefit for fiscal would have been  and the effective federal and state tax rate would have been in fiscal  compared to in fiscal in fiscal and  nondeductible expenses reduced the company s income tax benefit and were the primary causes of the low effective tax rate in comparison to the federal tax rate 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item net loss 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company reported a net loss of   before the provision for a deferred tax valuation allowance in fiscal  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company funded its early growth and the commercial introduction of its services through equipment sale leaseback financing  and the issuance of debt and equity securities  including the sale of common stock in an initial public offering in march since its initial public offering  the company has primarily financed its operations through cash flow from operations  cash reserves  operating leases and periodic usage of its line of credit 
the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled  at march  during fiscal  the company incurred capital expenditures of approximately  primarily for upgrades and additions to its fleet of drilling equipment and purchases of conventional and other equipment in order to respond to its customers requests for expanded service capabilities 
the company expects to continue the periodic use of its line of credit to meet its short term financing needs  due to seasonal and other factors which impact the carrying amounts of accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
at march   the company had an available bank credit facility of  and an outstanding balance on the facility of  the credit facility expires on june   however  the company expects to be able to obtain a renewal of the facility 
review and outlook installation and replacement services 
the company currently owns equipment to field flowmole systems  and conventional trenching crews 
the company typically plans for excess equipment to allow time for preventive maintenance  matching of equipment to job types  mobilization time  or other equipment downtime factors 
the company has ordered new drilling systems to be purchased in fiscal and at least of those systems will be configured for north american flowmole operations 
the company expects to sell some portion of the remaining units to international customers and has flexibility to adjust delivery schedules and to quickly place new systems into service operations if demand arises 
the company also expects to acquire significant amounts of conventional trenching equipment in fiscal  but will use short term rentals to supplement its equipment needs until it chooses to acquire new or used equipment of its own 
the company currently plans to increase its personnel to add additional installation and replacement capabilities in fiscal however  the company s revenue levels  and the weighted average number of crews in operation on any given day  are also affected by factors which include weather  pricing  competition  customer work release practices  soil and other work difficulty determinants  and permitting 
see also the discussion under competition  seasonal factors and utilities budgetary considerations included under risk factors  below 
repair and restoration services 
the company expects a continuation of the trend towards increased customer acceptance of the cablecure process  including an increased level of work under test  treat or replace contracts 
the company is also beginning to offer traditional repair and maintenance services to gas and other utility customers  as part of its strategy to package multiple services 
the company anticipates that the trend towards lower pricing for cable replacement will continue to place downward pressure on the price for cablecure services 
see competition under part i  item i 
the company s ten largest cablecure customers account for the majority of the company s cablecure revenues 
the company expects to see increased volumes from new customers in calendar  and some increased volumes from existing customers  but expects to continue to be dependent upon a small number of customers 
the company s goal is to reduce this dependency through growth 
because the company s customers can typically cancel their work on short notice  a certain degree of uncertainty always exists in the company s future revenue levels 
see also the discussion under competition  seasonal factors  utilities budgetary considerations and dow corning corporation included under risk factors  below 
international operations 
the company intends to emphasize its service businesses and continuation of its spare parts revenues in future international operations 
the company operated five drilling crews in the united kingdom in fiscal compared to three in fiscal and has plans for further expansion 
revenues from drilling operations in the united kingdom were and of revenue from international operations in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
customer orders for united kingdom drilling services are typically of very short duration  so sudden unanticipated changes in the level of competition or customer demand could have an immediate adverse impact on the company s operations 
cablecure services in europe have been concentrated in germany and austria 
the company also has current licensees operating in korea and scandinavia 
international cablecure revenue levels  primarily from german operations  were approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal the company is in the process of adding personnel to support expected growth in european cablecure services 
customer acceptance of the cablecure process  however  is proceeding slowly in europe  as it did in past years in the united states 
the company plans to continue expanding its sales efforts throughout europe and asia 
spare parts sales accounted for and of revenue from international operations in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company expects to be able to maintain or increase its spare parts sales  due to the sales of additional new equipment in fiscal and any such sales in the future 
the company currently has sold virtually all of its inventories of new equipment 
because the company has yet to sell any equipment purchased from its new vendors  it cannot predict the level of any future equipment sales  and risk exists that its potential equipment customers and existing spare parts customers may award their business to competitors 
however  the company has begun quoting new systems for delivery in fiscal based on its planned delivery dates for new systems 
operating expenses 
the company substantially reduced its operating expenses in fiscal through the elimination of several positions at its corporate headquarters 
the company expects to reduce the size of its leased space for corporate offices but does not expect material savings before fiscal the company plans to add resources for recruiting  training  sales and marketing  and enhanced information systems during fiscal to support the planned growth in the company s operations  and accordingly expects operating expenses to increase in fiscal the exact amount of such increases cannot be projected with certainty 
the company has determined that some of its management information systems do not accurately adjust for the year  and has begun to evaluate its options for implementing new information systems in fiscal and fiscal that will replace the older systems 
no current estimate is available for the cost of the new information systems 
the company does not anticipate any material charge to earnings associated with writing off the net book value of capitalized hardware and software costs 
the company is required to pay a royalty to dow corning based on the net profits from worldwide cablecure services  as defined in the underlying exclusive license agreement 
the level of such provisions for royalty expenditures will continue to increase if the projections of improving levels of cablecure revenues are achieved 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item capital expenditures and other matters 
the company expects to continue to require substantial levels of capital spending 
in fiscal  capital spending will emphasize acquisition of new drilling systems  upgrading of existing field power units to support existing series d drills and future production of series g drills  as well as the purchase of additional conventional equipment  such as backhoes  to support customer requirements for increased turnkey capabilities 
the company s line of credit expires on june  the company expects to be able to negotiate an extension of this credit facility  or obtain a replacement facility from another financial institution  at similar terms and interest rates 
the company s financial performance and the interest rate environment at the time of renewal will be factors in determining the company s ability to achieve the renewal without an increase in borrowing costs 
the company expects to be able to finance its capital expenditures through cash generated by operations  together with lease financing and the periodic use of its line of credit 
however  there can be no assurance that such sources of financing will be available on acceptable terms  and the company may be forced to delay or reduce its capital spending as a result 
other matters 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standard no 
 earnings per share 
this statement will change the computation  presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings per share eps 
the statement will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december  this statement will replace primary eps with basic eps  the principal difference being the exclusion of common stock equivalents in the computation of basic eps 
in addition  this statement will require the dual presentation of basic and diluted eps on the face of the consolidated statement of operations 
eps computed pursuant to the statement is not expected to be materially different from the historical net income per share previously presented 
forward looking information 
this fiscal form k contains forward looking statements  in addition to those under the caption review and outlook 
such statements are subject to substantial risk 
actual results may vary materially due to risks and uncertainties inherent in the company s business  including those described under review and outlook and those described under risk factors  below 
risk factors competition 
the company has experienced a long term trend of declining prices for guided boring services  particularly for smaller diameter utility installations  due to competitive pressures and changes in utility bidding practices 
this trend has also caused the company to lower its prices for cablecure injection services  which are priced at a discount to replacement costs  including replacement via guided boring 
in addition  the company s utility customers are increasing their requests for turnkey installation  replacement and restoration services  requiring their drilling contractors to take responsibility for switching circuits  terminating circuits  and other non incidental tasks 
these tasks require additional equipment and labor  and the cost increases can offset any price increase the company is able to negotiate for the expansion of its services 
the company s average price per foot drilled or injected in fiscal increased slightly over its fiscal results due to increased work difficulty 
the overall trend of falling prices for guided boring services is expected to continue into the future  as more customers award work based on competitive bidding  more customers require their drilling contractors to perform additional tasks as part of the drilling contract  and more conventional contractors acquire drilling capabilities in order to enter into this segment of the construction industry 
this trend will continue to put downward pressure on the market price for cablecure services 
the company cannot predict the ultimate duration or the magnitude of these decreases 
seasonal factors 
weather and other seasonal factors may decrease the company s revenues and profits in any given period 
adverse weather may preclude the company from operating its flowmole drilling systems or providing its cablecure services at certain times of the year 
in addition  the company believes that the regular budgetary cycles of certain of its north american utility customers tend to concentrate demand for the company s services during the third quarter of its fiscal year the fourth quarter of the calendar year  although other budgetary factors described below may override this trend in any given quarter 
as a result of these factors  results of operation in any given fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results in any other fiscal quarter 
utilities budgetary considerations 
budgetary considerations  arising from unfavorable regulatory determinations on matters such as rate setting  capitalization of services performed by the company  or siting of power production facilities  or from reductions in new housing starts  reductions in electric utility revenues due to mild weather  and general economic downturns have affected the ability of some of the company s utility customers to sustain their cable replacement or other maintenance programs and accordingly adversely impact the company s revenues and profits 
although the company has broadened its customer base  three customers generate a significant portion of the company s consolidated revenues  and a small number of customers generate more than half of its cablecure revenues 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item because cable replacement  restoration and other maintenance programs are  to a substantial extent  deferrable and the company s contracts with its utility customers permit termination of orders on relatively short notice  postponement or cancellation of such programs by customers can interject substantial volatility into the company s revenues and profits 
dow corning corporation 
the company purchases its cablecure fluid exclusively from dow corning 
in may  dow corning filed for protection under chapter while the company has been informed by dow corning that it intends to continue the cablecure business  there can be no assurance that dow corning or the bankruptcy court will not take action to amend or terminate the cablecure license agreement 
see the discussion under the cablecure service in part i  item florida subcontract negotiations 
the company is party to an agreement which requires it to utilize a single florida based subcontractor for performance of certain cablecure injection tasks for florida power light through january the agreement requires the company to pay the subcontractor a percentage of the amount charged to florida power light for certain services defined in the agreement 
the company is in the process of negotiating new terms of its subcontract  effective april   based on new pricing agreed to between the company and florida power light 
an interim agreement  subject to retroactive adjustments  was entered into for the period april  to may  there can be no assurance that the final price settled upon for payments to subcontractor will not result in an adverse effect on the gross profit realized by the company under its contract with florida power light 
impact of inflation and changing prices 
inflation has had only a minimal effect on the company s revenues and expenses and is not expected to have a significant impact on revenues or expenses in fiscal foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s financial results are affected by fluctuations in certain foreign currencies  particularly the british pound sterling
