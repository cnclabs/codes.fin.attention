additionally  the company spent approximately  on capital equipment  primarily for management information systems and engineering equipment  and facilities expansion 
the company anticipates spending approximately  on capital purchases through the end of fiscal cash provided by financing activities of  was due primarily to proceeds from the exercise of common stock options 
the company s working capital decreased by  from march  to  at march  in addition to cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  the company has  available under an unsecured revolving line of credit 
the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime rate and expires on july  the company anticipates that this line of credit will be renewed 
as of march   the company had no borrowings outstanding 
management believes that existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  available bank borrowings and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s cash and investment requirements through at least fiscal factors that may affect future results of operations except for the historical information contained in this annual report  the matters discussed herein are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including those related to management of growth  quarterly fluctuations of operating results  sales of windows and macintosh products  impact of competition  the developing multimedia  internet and on line services markets  and the other risks detailed below  and from time to time in the company s other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the actual results that the company achieves may differ materially from any forward looking statements due to such risks and uncertainties 
fluctuations of operating results  product introduction delays 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on the timing of new product introductions and enhancements by the company 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues are derived from its three key products director  freehand and authorware  in both standalone and studio format 
the company has in the past experienced delays in the development of new products and enhancement of existing products  and such delays may occur in the future 
if the company were unable  due to resource constraints or technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce such products in a timely manner  this inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
for instance  results for the third quarter were significantly affected by the shipment of a new version of freehand and the freehand graphics studio and by a decline in sales of director in anticipation of a new version which was originally expected to be released in the fourth quarter of fiscal the release of the new version of director was delayed in order for the company to perform additional quality assurance testing before releasing the product to the market  causing a significant decline in expected fourth quarter revenue 
if the company does not ship new versions of its products as planned  or sales of existing versions decline  the company s results of operations in a given quarter could be materially adversely affected 
the company s quarterly results of operations also may vary significantly depending on the timing of product introductions by competitors  changes in pricing  execution of technology licensing agreements and the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
the future operating results of the company may fluctuate as a result of these and other factors  including the company s ability to continue to develop or acquire innovative products  its product and customer mix and the level of competition 
the company s results of operations may also be affected by seasonal trends 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is relatively fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
as a result  if revenues do not meet the company s forecasts  operating results may be materially adversely affected 
for example  in fiscal  actual revenues were lower than plan revenues 
since operating expenses were budgeted based on plan revenues and the revenue shortfall was not mitigated by a decline in operating expenses  the company experienced a substantial loss for fiscal dependence on macintosh platform 
a majority of the company s revenues has been derived from its products for the macintosh 
although sales of the company s products for windows accounted for approximately of total revenue for fiscal and are expected to become an increasingly important component of the company s revenues  the company remains heavily dependent on the sale of products for the macintosh platform 
apple computer  inc continues to report declining sales of its macintosh computers  substantial losses and additional restructurings 
a continuing leveling off or decline in the sales rate of multimedia capable macintosh computers or shifts in mail order or other distribution mechanisms for macintosh products could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
dependence on distributors 
a substantial majority of the company s revenues is derived from the sale of its products through a variety of distribution channels  including traditional software distributors  educational distributors  vars  oems  hardware and software superstores  retail dealers  mail order  and direct sales 
domestically  the company s products are sold primarily through distributors  vars  and oems 
in particular  one distributor  ingram micro  inc  accounted for  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
internationally  the company s products are sold through distributors 
the company s resellers generally offer products of several different companies  including in some cases products that are competitive with the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company s resellers will continue to purchase the company s products or provide them with adequate levels of support 
in addition  the company believes that certain distributors are reducing their inventory in the channel and returning unsold products to better manage their inventories 
in addition  distributors are increasingly seeking to return unsold product  particularly when such products have been superseded by a new version or upgrade of a product 
if the company s distributors were to seek to return increasing amounts of products  such returns could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and results of operations 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in sales volume to  a significant reseller could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
risks associated with acquisitions 
macromedia has grown in part because of combinations with other companies 
in january  macromedia acquired altsys corporation  which developed the freehand graphic design and illustration product whose revenues prior to that date consisted primarily of royalties from aldus corporation  which had marketed freehand until january  and revenues from fontographer  software for creating and modifying fonts 
in august  the company acquired fauve software  inc  a developer of image editing software 
in december  the company acquired osc  a developer of digital audio production software 
in march  the company acquired iband  inc  a developer of internet web site development tools 
in december  the company acquired futurewave software  inc  a developer of internet graphics and animation software 
except for freehand  none of the acquired products has accounted for a significant portion of the company s revenues to date 
additionally  there are integration risks associated with merging two companies including financial  administrative and cultural concerns 
there can be no assurance that sales of the company s existing products will either continue at historical rates or increase  or that new products introduced by the company  whether developed internally or acquired  will achieve market acceptance 
the company s historical rates of growth should not be taken as indicative of growth rates that can be expected in the future 
intense competition 
the markets for the company s products are highly com petitive and characterized by pressure to reduce prices  incorporate new features  and accelerate the release of new product versions 
for example  the decrease in price of the authorware interactive studio in the second quarter of fiscal led to an increase in unit sales but resulted in a decrease in revenue as the unit increase was not sufficient to offset the price decrease 
a number of companies currently offer products that compete directly or indirectly with one or more of the company s products 
these companies include adobe systems incorporated adobe  aimtech corporation  apple computer  inc  asymetrix corporation  autodesk  inc  corel corporation corel  microsoft corporation microsoft and strata incorporated 
as the company competes with larger competitors such as adobe  corel and microsoft across a broader range of product lines and different platforms  the company may face increasing competition from such companies 
rapidly changing technology 
the developing digital media  internet and online services markets  and the personal computer industry in general  are characterized by rapidly changing technology  resulting in short product life cycles and rapid price declines 
the company must continuously update its existing products to keep them current with changing technology and must develop new products to take advantage of new technologies that could render the company s existing products obsolete 
the company s future prospects are highly dependent on its ability to increase functionality of existing products in a timely manner and to develop new products that address new technologies and achieve market acceptance 
shorter product life cycles may lead to inventory obsolescence problems 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company was adversely affected by the delay in the release of the upgraded version of director from the fourth quarter of fiscal to the first quarter of fiscal new products and enhancements must keep pace with competitive offerings  adapt to new platforms and emerging industry standards and provide additional functionality 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts 
risks of international operations 
for the twelve months ended march   the company derived approximately of its total revenues from international sales 
the company expects that international sales will continue to generate a significant percentage of its total revenues 
the company relies on distributors for sales of its products in foreign countries and  accordingly  is dependent on their ability to promote and support the company s products  and in some cases  to translate them into foreign languages 
international business is subject to a number of special risks  including foreign government regulation  general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability  hostilities with neighboring countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  more prevalent software piracy  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  foreign currency risk  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
as of april   the company s revenues generated through international sales in certain european countries are denominated in local currency  while expenses continue to be denominated in the local currency of the countries in which the company has offices 
as a result of this program  the company has entered into hedging contracts to protect it from exchange rate fluctuations 
as of march   the contracts outstanding totaled  these contracts are of a short term duration and the fair value of such contracts equals the market value as of march  item a
