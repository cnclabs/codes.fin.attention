overview the company experienced its most successful year during fiscal all regions have increased equipment use because of higher oil and gas prices  increased emphasis on horizontal drilling  lower production costs for major and independent oil and gas producers  renewed focus on domestic production and the effects of several new alliances the company entered into with its customers 
fluctuations in well servicing activity have had a strong correlation with fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
if oil and gas prices were to drop significantly from current levels  the company would expect a decrease in demand for drilling and services which would negatively affect the company s operating performance

liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents increased by million for the year ended june  from million as of june  to million as of june  this increase was primarily the result of proceeds from the bank credit agreement 
the company has projected million for oilfield service capital expenditures for fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively
