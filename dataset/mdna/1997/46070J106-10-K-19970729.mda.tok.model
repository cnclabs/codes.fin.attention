factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k may contain forward looking information within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities and exchange act of  and is subject to the safe harbor created by those sections 
the company assumes no obligation to update the information contained in the following section or any other portion of this form k 
the development tools market is characterized by rapid changes in technology and user needs 
compatibility of the company s products with customers preferred operating systems and database management systems are important to future results of the company 
the current market trend appears to be weighted towards building client server and cooperative applications using a changing mix of operating systems 
in addition  the development tools must function within the internet and intranet environments 
the company has introduced new products  such as its allegris series and the qualityworks series in late fiscal the company has also discontinued marketing selected products across its different product lines and closely evaluate other non strategic products  such as appmaster designer 
in fiscal  revenue growth from the company s primary solution areas more than offset revenue declines from non strategic products 
because of the rapidly changing market  there is no assurance that this substantial growth from the primary solution areas will continue 
future operating results could be affected by the market s acceptance of the company s existing and new products in this rapidly changing market 
competition in the software development tools market is very intense 
new and established companies continue to develop and market competitive products 
principal factors affecting competition are product performance and functionality  compatibility with the customer s operating environment  ease of use  price and quality of customer support  documentation and services 
the company anticipates that it will continue to experience competition from current vendors and new firms entering the market 
the company s service fee revenues have continued to grow in fiscal continued growth of service revenues is dependent upon acceptance of the company s products within the market and the company s ability to recruit  train and retain sufficiently skilled personnel to deliver the services 
the demand for personnel with information technology skills is very strong  accordingly the company must compete with numerous other companies when recruiting personnel 
the company has received and anticipates receiving additional contracts as part of its year renewal solution offerings 
certain contracts may be large  multi year service contracts with staged payment terms 
a delay in receiving these contracts  as compared to the company s expected date  could impact the results for the quarter 
there is also a risk of successfully managing a larger project and the risk of a material impact on results because of unanticipated problems or delays  suspensions  renegotiations or cancelllations of large projects  which could adversely impact the expected profitability of the contract s 
the company markets and sells its products directly through its own operations in the united states  united kingdom  germany  france  belgium  japan and australia and through a network of dealer distributors in other countries 
consequently  the company s results are affected by changes in the global economies and foreign currency exchange rates 
although the company does not believe that its business is subject to seasonal variations  sales historically tend to be strongest during the fourth quarter of a fiscal year 
as a result  the company typically experiences lower revenues for the first quarter of a fiscal year than in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
the company s experience has also been that a major portion of its revenue is recognized during the last month of a fiscal quarter and that fluctuations in revenue and earnings may occur due to the timing of orders 
quarterly results therefore can vary to the extent that sales for a quarter are delayed  particularly since a large portion of the company s expenses do not vary with revenues 
inflation has not had a material effect on the past results of the company  however  there can be no assurance that the results of operations will not be affected in the future
