net interest income during  the company experienced a decline in lower cost savings account balances and a decrease in earning asset yields 
these trends were partially offset by an increase in average earning assets  including an increase in the tax free investment securities and loan balances 
the combination of these items resulted in an overall decrease in the company s net interest income levels from comparing to  the company was able to increase net interest income levels  as increases in earning asset yields offset the decline in average earning assets and lower cost deposits

investment portfolio the company maintains a securities portfolio consisting of u 
s treasury  us government agencies and corporations  state and political subdivisions  asset backed and other securities 
investment securities are held in safekeeping by an independent custodian 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued a special report  a guide to implementation of statement no 
 on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities questions and answers the special report 
the special report allowed companies to reassess the appropriateness of the classifications of all securities and account for any reclassification at fair value 
the company adopted the reclassification provision stated in the special report prior to december  and transferred million of securities held to maturity into available for sale 
the unrealized pretax gain upon transfer was million as of december  the objective of the investment securities held to maturity is to strengthen the portfolio yield  and to provide collateral to pledge for federal  state and local government deposits and other borrowing facilities 
the investments held to maturity had an average term to maturity of months at december  and  on the same date  those investments included million in fixed rate and  in adjustable rate securities 
investment securities available for sale are generally used to supplement the banks liquidity 
unrealized net gains and losses on these securities are recorded as an adjustment to equity  net of taxes  and are not reflected in the current earnings of the company 
if a security is sold  any gain or loss is recorded as a charge to earnings and the equity adjustment is reversed 
at december   the banks held million classified as investments available for sale 
at december   an unrealized gain of million  net of taxes of million  related to these securities was held in shareholders equity 
the company had no trading securities at december  for more information on investment securities  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements

asset quality the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations 
the company continues its strategy to control its exposure to loans with higher credit risk and increase diversification of earning assets into less risky investments 
asset reviews are performed using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies 
assets receiving lesser grades fall under the classified assets category  which includes all non performing assets and potential problem loans  and receive an elevated level of attention to ensure collection 
the following is a summary of classified assets on the dates indicated at december  in millions classified loans other classified assets total classified assets classified loans at december  decreased million or percent to million from december  reflecting improvements in the borrowers financial condition and satisfaction of debt 
the improvement is primarily due to repayments and charge offs of classified loans with real estate collateral 
other classified assets increased million from the prior year  due to the net effect of new foreclosures on loan collateral  and sales and write downs of properties acquired in satisfaction of debt other real estate owned 
non performing assets non performing assets include non accrual loans  loans or more days past due as to principal or interest and still accruing and other real estate owned 
loans are placed on non accrual status upon reaching days or more delinquent  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
interest previously accrued on loans placed on non accrual status is charged against interest income 
in addition  loans secured by real estate with temporarily impaired values and commercial loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties are placed on non accrual status even though the borrowers continue to repay the loans as scheduled 
such loans are classified by management as performing non accrual and are included in the total non performing assets 
performing non accrual loans are reinstated to accrual status when improvements in credit quality eliminate management s doubt as to the full collectibility of both principal and interest and the loan is brought current 
when the ability to fully collect non accrual loan principal is in doubt  cash payments received are applied against the principal balance of the loan until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected 
any additional payments received after that point are recorded as interest income on a cash basis 
the following summarizes the company s non performing assets for the periods indicated at december  in millions performing non accrual loans non performing non accrual loans total non accrual loans loans or more days past due and still accruing total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets reserve for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans performing non accrual loans increased million to million at december   while non performing non accrual loans decreased million to million at december   due to loan collections  write downs  payoffs and sales 
the increased other real estate owned balance during was due to higher foreclosure on loans with real estate collateral  net of write downs and liquidations 
the decreased other real estate owned balance during from was due to asset write downs and liquidations 
the amount of gross interest income that would have been recorded for non accrual loans for the year ended december   if all such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms while outstanding during the period was  compared to  and million in and  respectively

the reserve is allocated to segments of the loan portfolio based in part on a quantitative analysis of historical credit loss experience 
criticized and classified loans balances are analyzed using a linear regression model or standard allocation percentages 
the results of this analysis are applied to current criticized and classified loan balances to allocate the reserve to the respective segments of the loan portfolio 
in addition  loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines due to their small balances and numerous accounts  are analyzed based on the historical rate of net losses and delinquency trends grouped by the number of days the payments on those loans are delinquent 
management continues to evaluate the loan portfolio and assess current economic conditions that will dictate future reserve levels

the increase in the allocation to commercial loans from december to december is primarily due to the inclusion of reserves allocated to certain loans acquired through the company s mergers 
the unallocated component includes management s judgmental determination of the amounts necessary for concentrations  economic uncertainties and other subjective factors 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures sfas 
under sfas  a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impairment may be based on i the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the observable market price of the impaired loan or iii the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan 
sfas as amended by sfas does not apply to large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
in measuring impairment  the company reviews all impaired commercial and construction loans classified substandard and doubtful that meet materiality thresholds of  and  respectively 
all loss classified loans are fully reserved under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology 
the company considers classified loans below the established thresholds to represent immaterial loss risk 
commercial and construction loans that are not classified  and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans such as installment  personal revolving credit  residential real estate and student loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology and are  therefore  excluded from the provisions of sfas the company generally identifies loans as impaired when such loans are in non accrual status or are considered troubled debt restructurings due to the granting of a below market rate of interest or a partial forgiveness of indebtedness on an existing loan 
the following summarizes the company s impaired loans for the periods indicated at december  in thousands non accrual loans   other  total impaired loans   specific reserves  the million increase in loans classified as impaired as of december   other than non accrual loans  is due to the addition of two commercial real estate loans  included in classified loan balances  with collateral exposure as to which management has doubt concerning whether the company will be able to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual agreements 
the average balances of the company s impaired loans for the year ended december  was million compared to million in in general  the company does not recognize any interest income on trouble debt restructurings or loans that are classified as non accrual 
for other impaired loans  interest income may be recorded as cash is received  provided that the company s recorded investment in such loans is deemed collectible 
asset and liability management the fundamental objective of the company s management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk 
the primary analytical tool used by the company to gauge interest rate sensitivity is a simulation model used by many major banks and bank regulators 
this model is used to simulate  based on the current and projected portfolio mix  the effects on net interest income of changes in market interest rates 
under the company s policy and practice  the projected amount of net interest income over the ensuing twelve months is not allowed to fluctuate more than ten percent  even under alternate assumed interest rate changes of plus or minus basis points 
the results of the model indicated that the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december  would not result in a fluctuation of net interest income exceeding percent 
the company considers various methods of interest rate risk management including interest rate swaps  utilized to hedge the impact of interest rate fluctuations on interest bearing assets and liabilities in the current interest rate environment 
interest rate swaps are agreements to exchange interest payments computed on notional amounts  which are used as a basis for the calculations only and do not represent exposure to risk for the company 
the risk to the company is associated with fluctuations of interest rates and with the counterparty s ability to meet its interest payment obligations 
the company minimizes this credit risk by entering into contracts with well capitalized money center banks and by requiring settlement of only the net difference between the exchanged interest payments 
at december  and  no interest rate swap contracts were outstanding 
during august  two contracts  with notional amounts totaling million expired 
the company paid a variable rate based on three month libor and received an average fixed rate of percent 
during  the company was engaged in four interest rate swaps  with notional amounts totaling million 
two swaps  with notional amounts totaling million expired in november and december  the effect of entering into these contracts resulted in reductions of net interest income of  and  in and  respectively 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the following table summarizes the interest sensitivity gaps inherent in the company s asset and liability portfolios at december  repricing within over one non in millions days days days days year repricing total assets investment securities loans  other assets total assets   liabilities non interest bearing interest bearing transaction money market savings passbook savings time short term borrowings long term debt other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity  net liabilities assets subject to repricing  cumulative net liabilities assets subject to repricing the repricing terms of the table above do not represent contractual principal maturity  but rather principal cash flows available for repricing 
the interest rate sensitivity report shown above categorizes interest bearing transaction deposits and savings deposits as repricing within days 
however  it is the experience of management that the historical interest rate volatility of these interest bearing transaction and savings deposits can be similar to liabilities with longer repricing dates  depending on market conditions 
moreover  the degree to which these interest bearing transaction and savings deposits respond to changes in money market rates usually is less than the response of interest rate sensitive loans 
these factors cause the cumulative net liability position shown above to indicate a much greater degree of liability sensitivity than management believes really exists based on the additional analysis previously discussed 
liquidity the principal sources of asset liquidity are marketable investment and money market securities available for sale 
at december   investment securities available for sale totaled million 
changing the pattern from the last two years  gross loan balances grew million from  compared to more moderate increases of million and million in and  respectively 
these increases were in part funded by the cash generated by financing activities represented  in  by a million increase in deposits and the issuance of million of the company s senior notes  partially offset by a decrease of million in purchased funds 
these compare with decreases in deposits of million and million during and  respectively  and reductions of million and million in long term notes payable for the same periods  offset by million and million increases in purchased funds for and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities was also used to fund the investment securities portfolio which increased million in and million and million in and  respectively 
the company generates significant liquidity from its operating activities 
the company s profitability in  and generated cash flows provided by operations of million  million and million  respectively 
it is the intention of the company to continue to increase loan volume without jeopardizing credit quality 
management of the company anticipates the company will increase its cash levels through the end of mainly through increased profitability and retained earnings  although some adverse impacton the company s results of operations is expected to occur during the calendar quarter in which its acquisition of vallicorp holdings  inc closes due to merger related costs 
for the same period  it is anticipated that the investment securities portfolio and demand for loans will continue to moderately increase 
growth in deposit balances is expected by management to follow the anticipated growth in loan and investment balances through the end of acquisition as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on november   the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire by merger with vallicorp holdings  inc it is expected that this merger will be consummated in the second quarter of and accounted for according to the pooling of interests method 
capital resources the current and projected capital position of the company and the impact of capital plans and long term strategies is reviewed regularly by management 
the company s capital position represents the level of capital available to support continued operations and expansion 
the company s primary capital resource is shareholders equity  which increased million or percent from the previous year end and increased million or percent from december  the ratio of total risk based capital to risk adjusted assets was percent at december   compared to percent at december  tier i risk based capital to risk adjusted assets was percent at december   compared to percent at december  capital to risk adjusted assets minimum regulatory capital at december  requirements tier i capital total capital leverage ratio the risk based capital ratios declined in as the increase in total assets outpaced the growth in equity 
in addition  the level of risk adjusted assets increased  as loan growth exceeded the growth in investment securities 
capital ratios are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that capital exceeds the prescribed regulatory minimums and is adequate to meet the company s future needs 
all ratios are in excess of the regulatory definition of well capitalized 
beginning in  the the company commenced to repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time  subject to appropriate regulatory and other accounting requirements 
these purchases were made periodically in the open market and reduced the dilutive impact of issuing new shares to meet stock performance  option plans  acquisitions and other requirements

due to aggressive policies in place  the company was able to increase its deposit totals to an all time high of  million  representing an increase of million or two percent over prior year 
the following table sets forth  by time remaining to maturity  the company s domestic time deposits in amounts of  or more in thousands at december  three months or less  over three through six months  over six through twelve months  over twelve months  total  short term borrowings the following table sets forth the short term borrowings of the company for the periods indicated at december  in thousands federal funds purchased   other borrowing funds retail repurchased agreements    other    total other borrowing funds    total funds purchased    further detail of the other borrowed funds are as follows in thousands outstanding average for the year    maximum during the year    interest rates average for the year average at period end non interest income components of non interest income in millions deposit account fees credit card merchant fees mortgage banking income financial services commissions trust fees other income total non interest income was million in   higher than credit card merchant fees and financial services commissions were approximately  and  respectively  higher than prior year due to increased volume of activity 
deposit account fees were  higher than partially offsetting these increases  mortgage banking income was  lower than  due to reduced servicing income and trust fees were  lower than prior year 
non interest income was million in  million lower than lower mortgage banking income due to reduced refinancing volumes resulting in lower income from sales of loans  lower deposit account fees and lower trust fees  account for the majority of the decrease

these were the major reasons for the decreases in almost all non interest expense categories  including million lower employee related costs  a million reduction in professional fees  million lower occupancy and equipment expenses   lower other real estate owned costs   lower insurance expense and  each  lower data processing costs  advertising and public relations expenses and operational losses 
in addition  the company benefited from the elimination of fdic premiums  contributing million to the total decrease in non interest expense from non interest expense decreased million or percent in compared with lower expenses in reflect the company s improved efficiency and exercise of cost controls  plus the effect of consolidating operations after the merger activity 
the combination of these effects is the main reason for the million decrease in personnel related expenses  million reduction in loan related expenses  and other reductions in most non interest expense categories 
in addition  a million reduction in fdic insurance expense  resulting from reduced premiums  contributed to the overall year to year decreases 
the ratio of average assets per full time equivalent staff was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the company s strategy to improve efficiency and consolidate operations after merger activity can be seen in the reduction of the average number of full time equivalent staff from  in to and in and  respectively 
provision for income tax the provision for income tax increased by million in mainly as a direct result of higher pretax income partially offset by an increase in tax exempt interest income from municipal securities 
the provision of million reflects an effective tax rate of percent compared to provisions of million in and million in  reflecting effective tax rates of percent and percent  respectively
