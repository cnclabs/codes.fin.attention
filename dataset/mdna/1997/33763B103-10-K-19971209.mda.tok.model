gain after commissions earned  premiums paid and recognition of provision for possible credit losses 
the company s increase in securitization activity is related to the increased origination of high ltv loans from fiscal to fiscal  due to the following reasons the company increased the size of its correspondent network during this time period  both numerically to for the fiscal year and geographically states versus states during the respective fiscal years  the company increased its production of direct to consumer loans from million to million during the respective fiscal years  the company paid net loan premiums of million in fiscal  compared to net loan premiums of million in fiscal  representing an average loan purchase price of of par for fiscal  and of par for fiscal this increase resulted from the company s purchase of loans with relatively higher fico scores in fiscal loan purchase prices are directly related to the quality of the loans purchased  the face interest rate of the acquired loans  the quantity of loans that the correspondent commits to sell  the nature and longevity of the relationship that the company maintains with the correspondent and competitive pressures 
the company increased the number of whole loan sales during fiscal through the sale of title i loans and conforming first lien loans to government agencies and home equity loans to other finance companies 
interest only strips interest income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase is the result of the company having an increased amount of securitizations that produce more interest income 
interest income increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase is a result of the increased loan production during fiscal and the company s ability to hold loans on its balance sheet for longer periods of time prior to securitization  thereby increasing the average loans held for sale balance 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company s average monthly balance of loans held for sale was million and billion  respectively  an increase of million  or  respectively 
servicing fee income increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of a significant increase in the average balance of the serviced loan portfolio from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal  an increase of billion  or 
this increase in the company s average serviced loan portfolio was the result of the company s increase in securitizations during fiscal origination income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the company collects origination fees on direct to consumer loan originations 
the origination fees are deferred and recognized when the loans are securitized  based on an average allocation methodology 
the increase in origination income is the result of direct to consumer loan originations increasing from to of total high ltv loan production in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
other income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
a large component of this increase is due to the increase of insurance related premiums 
the increase in direct to consumer loans provides the company with the opportunity to sell add on products such as credit related policies

although the number of employees increased  the company s employees were able to originate  securitize and service a proportionately larger loan volume  thereby generating proportionately larger revenues per employee 
the company earned  of revenue per employee for fiscal  compared to  of revenue per employee for fiscal interest expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
interest expense increased primarily because there were significant increases in borrowings under the company s various facilities during fiscal and subordinated debt was outstanding for all of fiscal  while it was outstanding for only months during fiscal as of september   the company s warehouse debt totaled million and bore interest at a weighted average rate of approximately 
as of september   the company s warehouse debt totaled billion and bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
other operating expenses increased as the company accommodated the significantly expanded loan origination  securitization and servicing volumes during the respective fiscal years 
other operating expenses consist primarily of rents  professional fees and the costs associated with marketing  underwriting  administration and servicing 
the company expects to incur significantly greater marketing expenses in fiscal due to its continued strategy of increasing its brand name recognition and its goal of generating significantly larger amounts of direct to consumer loans 
the provision for possible credit losses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase reflects the growth in the loans held for sale portfolio during fiscal  as well as the impact of holding the loans on the balance sheet for longer periods of time during fiscal fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  the company s total revenues increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of increases in the company s net gain on securitized loan sales  although the company also experienced significant increases in its servicing related income  interest income and other income during this time period

gain after commissions earned  premiums paid and recognition of provision for possible credit losses 
the company s increased securitization activity relates to the increased origination of high ltv loans for fiscal the company was able to increase its production of high ltv loans from fiscal to fiscal  for the following reasons the company increased the size of its correspondent network during this time period  both numerically to during the respective fiscal years and geographically states to states during the respective fiscal years  the company increased its production of direct to consumer loans from  to million during the respective fiscal years  the company decreased its production of loans originated through home improvement contractors  which are generally of lower quality  from million to million during the respective fiscal years  and the company acquired first security mortgage corp 
which the company operates as its firstplus east division in december in a purchase transaction and firstplus west in may in a pooling transaction 
during fiscal  firstplus east and firstplus west originated a total of million of strategic loans 
during fiscal  the company originated and securitized a greater percentage of non title i loans  when compared to fiscal this continued increase in non title i loan emphasis was a result of the relatively small size of the title i loan market and the company s desire to meet the needs of its customers  who generally request higher loan amounts and more flexible loan proceeds utilization than the title i program offers 
although non title i loans require the company to reserve greater amounts for anticipated losses than do title i loans  title i loans generally produce lower gross revenues due to the increased premiums paid in acquisition 
the company s profit margin on securitized loans sold increased from a weighted average of for fiscal to for fiscal a portion of this increase was due to the fact that the company was contractually required to share its securitization gains in its and securitizations  which closed in december and june  respectively 
while the company was not required to share any securitization gain for any securitizations closed during fiscal  million of loans delivered in october  that were attributable to the securitization were subject to the sharing arrangement 
profit margin increases also resulted from the favorable interest rate environment during the period from october to january  and from increases in interest paid over the life of the loan 
the company s gain on securitized loan sales  net  profit margin decreased during fiscal  from in the first quarter to in the fourth quarter 
the decrease was primarily due to the sharp increases in general interest rates from february to june the company received net loan discounts of  for fiscal  compared to million of net loan premiums paid for fiscal this represented an average loan purchase price of of par for fiscal  compared to of par for fiscal this increase resulted from the company s purchase of loans with relatively higher fico scores and from increased competition for title i loans 
loan purchase prices are directly related to the quality of the loans purchased  the face interest rate of the acquired loans  the quantity of loans that the correspondent commits to sell  the nature and longevity of that the relationship the company maintains with the correspondent and competitive pressures 
interest only strips interest income increased from none in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was the result of the company having no interest only strips outstanding in fiscal interest income increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of a significant increase in the company s average balance of loans held for sale 
the company securitizes its loans on a regular basis  however  it earns interest income on the loans it originates prior to such securitizations 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company s average monthly balance of loans held for sale  including non strategic loans  was million at par and million at par  respectively  an increase of million  or 
servicing fee income increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of a significant increase in the average balance of the serviced loan portfolio from million for fiscal to billion for fiscal  an increase of billion  or 
this increase in the company s average serviced loan portfolio was the result of the company s increases in loan originations and securitizations during the respective fiscal years 
remaining revenue items increased from  for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
remaining revenue items consist primarily of loan origination fees that are funded by borrowers at closing 
the following table sets forth information regarding the components of the company s expenses for fiscal and fiscal year ended september amounts in thousands salaries and employee benefits   interest expense   other operating expenses   provision for possible credit losses  total   salaries and employee benefits increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the company employed approximately persons as of september   compared to approximately persons as of september   an increase of 
however  during the same time  total revenues increased from million to million  an increase of million  or 
although the number of employees increased  the company s employees were able to originate  securitize and service a proportionately larger amount of loan volume  thereby generating proportionately larger revenues per employee 
the company earned  of revenue per employee for fiscal  compared to  of revenue per employee for fiscal interest expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
interest expense increased primarily because of the significant increases in borrowings under the company s warehouse facilities that were incurred during fiscal  partially offset by more favorable interest rates 
as of september   the company s warehouse debt totaled million and bore interest at a weighted average rate of approximately 
as of september   the company s warehouse debt totaled million and bore interest at a weighted average rate of approximately 
other operating expenses increased as the company accommodated the significantly expanded loan origination  loan servicing and loan securitization volumes during the respective fiscal years 
other operating expenses consist primarily of title i program insurance premiums paid upon the origination of title i loans  professional fees  rents and the costs associated with marketing  underwriting  administration and servicing 
the provision for possible credit losses on securitized loan sales increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in volume of loans securitized from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and to the fact that a greater amount of securitized loans in fiscal were non title i loans  which require the company to provide for a higher level of losses  as compared to insured title i loans 
to a lesser extent  the increase is the result of i an increase of million taken because the default rate for a pool of bulk purchased loans included in the securitization exceeded the estimates made at the time of the securitization  which adjustment was determined in conformity with the company s current estimation methodology  ii an increase of million taken for the increased amount of loans held for sale on the company s balance sheet and iii the company s change from a constant default rate to default curves commencing in the fourth quarter of fiscal income tax expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the income tax expense was recorded at statutory rates 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operations require continued access to financing sources 
the company s primary operating cash requirements include the funding of i loan originations  ii reserve accounts  overcollateralization requirements  fees and expenses incurred in connection with its securitization transactions  iii television  radio and direct mail advertising and other marketing and iv administrative and other operating expenses 
the company has been able to utilize a new securitization structure for the and securitizations that does not require an attendant monoline insurance policy 
this structure allows the company to issue the bonds without initial overcollateralization requirements 
overcollateralization requirements are met by future excess cash flows of the specific securitizations 
the company expects to continue to utilize this structure in future securitization transactions 
in october  the company increased a warehouse line facility with bank one  texas  na bank one facility from million to million 
in august  the company increased a repurchase facility with bear stearns home equity trust bear sterns facility from million to million 
at september   the company had million outstanding under the bank one facility and million outstanding under the bear stearns facility 
in november  the company entered into the million term line with bear stearns and co 
inc bear stearns term line 
the bear stearns term line may be utilized by pledging as collateral the interest only strips generated by securitizations in which bear stearns is the lead manager 
at september   the company had borrowed million under this facility 
in december  the company entered into the million term line with painewebber real estate securities inc the painewebber term line and the million repurchase facility with painewebber real estate securities inc painewebber repurchase facility 
in june  the repurchase facility was increased to million 
at september   the company had million outstanding under the term line and million outstanding under the repurchase facility 
in april  the company entered into a million repurchase facility with merrill lynch mortgage capital  inc merrill lynch repurchase facility and a million term line with merrill lynch mortgage capital  inc in june  the company increased the repurchase facility to million 
at september   the company had borrowed million under the repurchase facility and none under the term line 
in april  the company entered into a million warehouse line facility with industrial bank of japan ibj warehouse facility 
at september   the company had million outstanding under this facility 
at september   the company had borrowed million from a nationally recognized finance company under a warehouse line facility and term line facility 
as a result of the company s increasing volume of loan originations and purchases  and its expanding securitization activities  the company operates  and expects to continue to operate  on a negative operating cash flow basis 
the company s operations used million during fiscal and billion during fiscal the increase in the use of cash in operations is primarily related to the costs of an enlarged infrastructure  an increasing employee base and the company s securitization strategy which increases the gain on sale of securitized loans but reduces the amount of cash received on the sale of loans as compared to whole loan sales 
cash from financing and investing activities increased primarily due to additional borrowings related to the repurchase facilities  the term lines and other borrowings  which have been used to fund loan originations  working capital and securitization costs 
the company has significantly improved its negative cash flow experience by improving certain negative cash flow features of its securitization program and by maintaining a larger balance of loans held for sale on its balance sheet  which produces a positive net interest cash flow  as well as  increasing the collection of origination fees related to direct to consumer loans 
in addition  the company has begun to implement a strategy of maintaining a significant quantity of loans on its balance sheet  thus increasing the length of time that loans are held for sale and materially increasing its interest rate risk 
because the company s present loan facilities bear interest at variable rates  the company has a need for medium to long term fixed rate financing 
if the company is unable to obtain such financing  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial conditions 
based on the company s anticipated rate of growth  the company believes that it will need to arrange additional warehouse lines of credit or other financing sources within the next days 
the company is currently negotiating for increased and or additional warehouse facilities 
the company s existing warehouse lines of credit restrict its ability to incur other indebtedness 
the company has no commitments for such increased and or additional financings  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in consummating any such financing transactions in the future or on terms the company would consider to be favorable 
in such event  the company s growth and operations could be curtailed  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
certain accounting considerations during fiscal and fiscal  the company sold a substantial amount of its high ltv loans to third party investors in securitization transactions 
in a securitization transaction  loans originated and purchased by the company are sold to an independent entity  generally a grantor or owner trust  that holds the loans as trustee for third party investors 
the company retains the right to service the securitized loans or appoint an approved subservicer 
the company retains an interest only strip i o strip  which is certificated  which represents the present value of the right to the excess cash flows generated by the securitized loans that represents the difference between a interest at the stated rate paid by borrowers and b the sum of i pass through interest paid to third party investors  ii trustee fees  iii fha insurance fees if applicable  iv third party credit enhancement fees if applicable  v stipulated servicing fees and vi estimated loan portfolio losses 
the company s right to receive this excess cash flow stream begins after certain reserve requirements have been met  which are specific to each securitization and are used as a means of credit enhancement 
the company determines the present value of this anticipated cash flow stream at the time each securitization transaction closes  utilizing valuation assumptions appropriate for each particular transaction 
the significant valuation assumptions are related to the anticipated average lives of the loans sold  the anticipated prepayment speeds and the anticipated credit losses related thereto 
in order to determine the present value of this excess cash flow  the company currently applies an estimated market discount rate of between and to the expected pro forma gross cash flows  which are calculated utilizing the weighted average lives of the securitized loans  and currently applies a risk free discount rate of to the anticipated losses attendant to this pro forma cash flow stream the allowance for possible credit losses on loans sold on its balance sheet 
accordingly  the overall effective discount rate utilized on the cash flows  net of expected credit losses is approximately 
as of september  and  the company s i o strips were million and million  respectively  and its allowance for possible credit losses on loans securitized were million and million  respectively 
the allowance represented approximately and of the i o strips at september  and  respectively 
the annual prepayment rate of the securitized loans is a function of full and partial prepayments and defaults 
in the i o strips fair value estimates  the company makes assumptions of the prepayment rates of the underlying loans  which the company believes are reasonable 
during fiscal  the company utilized proprietary prepayment curves generated by the company s structured finance group reaching an approximate maximum annual rate of between and with respect to the calculation of the gross charge off rate for a particular securitization pool  the company  in part  utilizes the fico scores of that securitization pool to measure the creditworthiness of the borrowers whose loans are included in the pool 
during fiscal  the company s securitization pool score distributions typically were between and  with a weighted average pool score of between and the company estimates default rates for fico scores based on historical loan performance and other data available to the company 
the company has developed historical default rates for its borrowers based on each ten point interval of the fico score range 
using the expected default rate for each fico score interval for each securitization  the company estimates the overall default rate for the borrowers in the securitized pool 
when estimating the fair value of the i o strips attributable to these securitizations  the company assumes that its securitization pools will produce annual default rates that correspond to the historical default rates for the fico score ranges associated with the individual pools  adjusted for accelerated levels of defaults for loan pools with fico scores lower than and for seasoned loans that have little or no increase in the frequency of defaults 
in its estimates of annual default rates and total delinquencies  the company utilizes assumptions that it believes are reasonable 
the company estimates annual default rates and total delinquencies based upon fico scores  the life of the loans and the mix of the title i loans to conventional loans in the securitization  as well as other factors 
to more accurately reflect the timing of the actual loan default rates and the impact of the defaults on the overall prepayment rates  the company utilizes proprietary default curves rather than assuming that defaults occur in a straight line manner over time 
the use of the default curves does not impact the estimated total amount of defaults in a securitization  only the timing of when such defaults will occur 
the company believes that the recourse portion of the net i o strips value should be adequate to cover anticipated losses 
the company assumes that there will be no recoveries on charged off conventional loans in its loss estimates 
the company also estimates that total delinquencies ie  loans more than days past due will average to over the life of each securitization 
the i o strips are accounted for under sfas accounting for investments in certain debt and equity marketable securities 
as an i o strip is subject to significant prepayment risk  and therefore has an undetermined maturity date  it cannot be classified as held to maturity 
the company has chosen to classify its i o strips as available for sale securities 
based on this classification  the company is required to mark these securities to fair value with the accompanying increases or decreases in fair value being recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
the determination of fair value is based on the previously mentioned valuation basis  and the company assesses fair value quarterly 
as the gain recognized in the year of sale is equal to the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the i o strips  the amount of cash actually received over the lives of the loans normally exceeds the gain previously recognized at the time of the loans were sold  and  therefore  residual interest income is recognized over the life of the loans securitized 
the i o strips are amortized based on an accelerated method that is not materially different from the interest method 
the company generally retains the right to service loans it originates or purchases and then subsequently securitizes 
fees for servicing loans are based on a stipulated percentage generally of the unpaid principal balance of the associated loans 
prior to fiscal  the company recognized servicing fee income  late charges and other ancillary income when collected and charged costs to service loans when incurred 
for loan portfolios securitized subsequent to december   the company began recognizing a servicing asset as part of its gain on securitized loan sales 
the servicing asset is calculated as the present value of the expected future net servicing revenue based on common industry assumptions and the company s historical experience 
these factors include default and prepayment speeds 
on a quarterly basis  the company assesses the carrying value of its i o strips and servicing assets for impairment 
there can be no assurance that the company s estimates used to determine the gain on securitized loan sales  i o strips and servicing assets valuations will remain appropriate for the life of each securitization 
if actual loan prepayments or defaults exceed the company s estimates  the carrying value of the company s i o strips and or servicing assets may be decreased or the company may increase its allowance for possible credit losses on loans sold through a charge against earnings during the period management recognizes the disparity 
other factors may also result in a writedown of the company s i o strips in subsequent periods 
as of september   the company determined that no such impairment existed 
the company records its loans at the lower of cost or market 
any originations below par are recorded as loan origination discounts  thereby reducing the company s cost basis in such loans 
any purchases above par are recorded as loan purchase premiums  thereby increasing the company s cost basis in its loans 
if the company s accounts reflect net discounts in excess of premiums at the time it securitizes such loans  the company recognizes such net discount as a reduction to its cost of loans sold 
conversely  if the company s accounts reflect net premiums in excess of discounts at the time it securitizes its loans  the company recognizes such net premium as an addition to its cost of loans sold 
hedging activities the company s profitability may be directly affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
while the company monitors interest rates and employs a strategy designed to hedge some of the risks associated with changes in interest rates  no assurance can be given that the company s results of operations and financial condition will not be adversely affected during periods of fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s interest rate hedging strategy currently includes purchasing put contracts on treasury securities  selling short treasury securities and maintaining a pre funding strategy with respect to its securitizations 
since the interest rates on the company s indebtedness used to fund and acquire loans are variable and the rates charged on loans the company originates are fixed  increases in the interest rates after loans are originated and prior to their sale could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  increases in interest rates prior to sale of the loans may reduce the gain on securitized loan sales earned by the company 
the ultimate sale of the company s loans will fix the spread between the interest rates paid by borrowers and the interest rates paid to investors in securitization transactions with respect to such loans  although increases in interest rates may narrow the potential spread that existed at the time the loans were originated by the company 
impact of inflation increases in the inflation rate generally result in increased interest rates 
since the company borrows funds at a variable rate  increased interest rates will increase the borrowing costs of the company 
inflation will also increase the operating costs of the company 
the company may not be able to pass on the effects of inflation and accompanying higher interest rates to its borrowers due to usury laws  other legal or regulatory restrictions or competitive pressures 
seasonality the company is affected by consumer demand for debt consolidation and home improvement loans  which is partially influenced by regional trends  economic conditions and personal preferences 
the company s business is generally subject to seasonal trends  with home improvements generally peaking during the spring and summer seasons and declining to lower levels in the fall and winter months 
delinquencies on loan payments typically increase in november and december of each calendar year 
year the company utilizes a number of software systems to originate  securitize and service its various loan products 
the company has and will continue to make certain investments in its software systems and applications to ensure the company is year compliant 
the financial impact of becoming year compliant has not been and is not expected to be material to the company to its financial position or results of operations in a given year
