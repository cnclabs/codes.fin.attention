item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements of the company and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
introduction the company derives its revenue primarily from fees charged for ambulance and fire protection services 
the company provides ambulance services in response to emergency medical calls emergency ambulance services and non emergency transport services general transport services to patients on both a fee for service basis and nonrefundable subscription fee basis 
per transport revenue depends on various factors  including the mix of rates between existing markets and new markets and the mix of activity between emergency ambulance services and general transport services as well as other competitive factors 
fire protection services are provided either under contracts with municipalities or fire districts or on a nonrefundable subscription fee basis to individual homeowners or commercial property owners 
ambulance service fees are recorded net of medicare  medicaid  and other reimbursement limitations and are recognized when services are provided 
payments received from third party payors represent a substantial portion of the company s ambulance service fee receipts 
provision for doubtful accounts is made for the expected difference between ambulance services fees charged and amounts actually collected 
the company s provision for doubtful accounts generally is higher with respect to collections to be derived directly from patients than for collections to be derived from third party payors and generally is higher for emergency ambulance services than for general ambulance transport services 
because of the nature of the company s ambulance services  it is necessary to respond to a number of calls  primarily emergency ambulance service calls  which may not result in transports 
results of operations are discussed below on the basis of actual transports since transports are more directly related to revenue 
expenses associated with calls that do not result in transports are included in operating expenses 
the percentage of calls not resulting in transports varies substantially depending upon the mix of general transport and emergency ambulance service calls in the company s markets and is generally higher in markets in which the calls are primarily emergency ambulance service calls 
rates in the company s markets take into account the anticipated number of calls that may not result in transports 
the company does not separately account for expenses associated with calls that do not result in transports 
revenue generated under fire protection services contracts is recognized over the life of the contract 
subscription fees received in advance are deferred and recognized over the term of the subscription agreement  which generally is one year 
other revenue primarily consists of fees associated with alternative transportation services and home health care services and are recognized when the services are provided 
other operating expenses primarily consist of rent and related occupancy expenses  maintenance and repairs  insurance  fuel and supplies  travel and professional fees 
the company s net income for the year ended june  was million or per share 
this compares to net income of million and million  or and per share for the years ended june  and  respectively 
included in net income is an extraordinary charge to earnings of million  net of a million tax benefit  or per share  to reflect the loss on early extinguishment of debt 
during fiscal  the company completed the acquisition of eighteen ambulance service providers operating in arizona  arkansas  georgia  indiana  kentucky  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and ontario  canada

this seasonality has resulted from a number of factors  including relatively higher second and third fiscal quarter demand for transport services in the company s arizona and florida regions resulting from the greater winter populations in those regions 
the effect of the acquisition of ambulance service providers in the northeastern and midwestern regions of the united states has reduced  and will continue to reduce  the overall seasonality in operating results

during the year ended june   the company used million in cash flow from operations compared with million provided by operations in the preceding year  due primarily to increases in accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses and decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities

the company funded the cash portion of the acquisitions through operating cash flow and from the company s revolving credit facility 
subsequent to june  the company purchased either all the issued and outstanding stock or certain assets of four ambulance service providers with operations in alabama  georgia  mississippi  new jersey  new york and tennessee

the company expects that existing working capital  together with cash flow from operations and additional borrowing capacity  will be sufficient to meet its operating and capital needs for existing operations for the twelve months subsequent to june  the company is engaged in an active acquisition program 
the company intends to fund any acquisitions that it consummates through the use of cash from operations  credit facilities  seller notes payable and the issuance of common stock 
in addition  the company may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings 
the availability of these capital sources will depend upon prevailing market conditions  interest rates and the financial condition of the company
