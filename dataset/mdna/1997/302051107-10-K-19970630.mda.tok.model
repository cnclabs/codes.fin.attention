seasonality and weather the automotive aftermarket is seasonal as retail sales of replacement batteries are generally higher in the fall and winter the company s second and third fiscal quarters 
accordingly  demand for the company s automotive batteries is generally highest in the fall and early winter as retailers build inventories in anticipation of the winter season 
european sales are concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter the company s third quarter  due to the shipment of batteries for the winter season and the practice of many industrial battery customers particularly governmental and quasi governmental entities of deferring purchasing decisions until the end of the calendar year 
demand for automotive batteries is significantly affected by weather conditions
