item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in recent years  accurate and comprehensive information regarding foreign affairs and developments has become increasingly important to the united states government 
the reduction of united states military tactical forces overseas  coupled with political instability in certain regions such as the middle east  eastern europe  africa and south america  has heightened the united states government s need to be able to monitor overseas activities 
in order to obtain information about activities within foreign countries  the united states government gathers and analyzes telecommunication signals emanating from those countries 
the company devotes significant resources toward understanding the united states government s signal reconnaissance goals  capabilities and perceived future needs 
the company obtains information about these signal reconnaissance needs through frequent marketing contact between its employees and technical and contracting officials of the united states government 
the company believes that it has much more marketing contact with customers and potential customers than is customary among its competitors 
in addition  the company invests in r d which it anticipates will enable it to develop signal reconnaissance equipment that meets these needs 
the company believes that it invests a greater percentage of its revenues in r d than is typical among its competitors 
see research and development 
budgetary constraints and critical time to deployment have caused many united states government agencies to search for more flexible and cost effective signal reconnaissance solutions that can be deployed promptly 
the company s signal reconnaissance products can be used  with or without further modification  to satisfy requirements of a variety of customers 
the company believes its products can be readily deployed in a wide variety of circumstances to meet current united states government signal reconnaissance requirements 
the company designs its products to use advanced circuitry and highly integrated components  including company designed application specific integrated circuits asics 
this enables the company to offer products that are smaller  consume less power  and cost customers less when multiple units are built than equipment of similar functionality that use fewer advanced designs and materials 
potential commercial applications of the company s technology and equipment include digital video processing for high definition tv hdtv or interactive tv  wireless local loop demodulators and test equipment for the new technologies in wireless communications 
in this new market area  the company intends to license its technology to a strategic partner and  to a lesser degree  the company may develop the entire commercial product 
the company believes its employees are its most valuable resource 
description of the business applied signal technology designs  develops  and manufactures equipment to collect and process telecommunication signals for signal reconnaissance and commercial applications 
the signal reconnaissance equipment is purchased by both the military as well as the intelligence organizations of the united states government and is used for foreign signal reconnaissance 
the commercial telecommunications processing equipment has been developed for use in digital video transmission  wireless local loop systems  and as test equipment for a variety of wireless communication technologies 
signal reconnaissance in recent years  accurate and comprehensive information regarding foreign affairs and developments has become increasingly important to the united states government 
the reduction in united states military tactical forces overseas has heightened the united states government s need to quickly assess military risks  particularly in areas of instability as they develop around the world 
the breakup of the soviet union and civil unrest in certain nations in eastern europe  africa  and south america indicate an increase in geographic areas that might require monitoring 
in addition  the united states government requires information regarding overseas activities to conduct drug interdiction operations 
as part of its efforts to obtain information  the united states government gathers and analyzes telecommunication signals emanating from foreign countries 
in recent years  the use of established telecommunication technologies has increased throughout the world and new telecommunication technologies  supplementing rather than replacing prior technologies  have been developed and commercialized 
these trends have led to a significant increase in the overall volume of information communicated and an increase in the density of signals transmitted throughout the radio frequency spectrum 
this increase can be seen in the proliferation of facsimile  cellular  and digital signal telecommunications equipment and the global information network world wide web in the last decade  resulting in a significant increase in the amount of information being communicated 
these trends have required the development of signal reconnaissance equipment capable of collecting and processing an increased volume of signals as well as new types of signals 
traditionally  organizations within the united states government have satisfied their signal reconnaissance needs by first identifying their specific requirements and then contracting with government contractors to provide equipment 
contractors typically designed and built custom signal processing systems optimized to satisfy the particular needs of various agencies 
development of custom systems usually required many years of effort and involved great expense 
the time required to develop these systems often meant that when a system was delivered  it did not address new telecommunications technologies that had evolved during the development process 
these factors  combined with growing budgetary constraints  have caused many agencies to search for more flexible and cost effective signal reconnaissance solutions that can be deployed promptly 
commercial telecommunications the concept of an information superhighway involves the use of digital forms of telecommunications for transmission techniques 
digital telecommunications are subject to a variety of impairments that must be overcome by sophisticated  automatic signal processing 
the company continues working to exploit its existing technology in these new areas of opportunity 
the processing techniques developed by the company for its signal reconnaissance products can be applied to commercial digital video processing 
the company s signal reconnaissance analysis products also serve as a basis for commercial test equipment that can be used by wireless communications providers for transmission quality assessments 
strategy signal reconnaissance applied signal technology s objective is to anticipate the signal reconnaissance needs of the united states government and to invest in research and development in an effort to provide solutions before the company s competitors 
in some cases  this involves the development of equipment to address new telecommunications technologies 
in other cases  it involves the development of equipment that offers smaller size  lower power consumption  and lower cost than potentially competitive products 
the company s strategy to accomplish its objective includes the following elements anticipate government needs 
the company devotes significant resources in order to understand the united states government s signal reconnaissance goals  capabilities  and perceived future needs 
the company monitors technological and commercial advances in telecommunications to identify advances it believes may have an impact on the united states government s signal reconnaissance programs 
the company obtains information about the united states government s signal reconnaissance needs through frequent contact with employees and technical and contracting officials of the united stated government 
in contrast  the company believes that its competitors often wait until the united states government requests competitive proposals for equipment to satisfy specific requirements and then respond to these requests 
sole source contracts are let by the united states government when a single contractor is deemed to have an expertise or technology that is superior to that of competing contractors 
since the company s inception  almost all of its revenues have been from sole source contracts 
the company believes that the large number of sole source contracts it obtains demonstrates that it often anticipates the signal reconnaissance needs of the united states government correctly 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will anticipate correctly the signal reconnaissance needs of the united states government in the future 
invest in research and development 
the company invests in research and development it believes will enable it to develop signal reconnaissance equipment that will satisfy the needs of the united states government 
the company believes that it invests a greater percentage of its revenues in r d than is typical among its competitors 
the company believes its r d investments often enable it to offer superior products before its competitors once the united states government identifies a need 
develop flexible products 
the company develops signal reconnaissance products that can be used  with or without further modification  to satisfy the needs of a variety of customers 
the company uses its prior product development efforts to offer customers cost effective solutions and to offer these solutions promptly 
the company believes that custom equipment developed by many of the company s competitors  generally  cannot be as readily deployed in as wide a variety of circumstances as the company s products 
develop highly integrated products 
the company designs its products to use advanced circuitry and highly integrated components 
this enables the company to offer products that are smaller  consume less power  and cost customers less when multiple units are built than equipment of similar functionality that use fewer advanced designs and materials 
the lower cost of many of the company s products appeals to customers with budget constraints  and the smaller size and low power consumption of many of the company s products appeal to customers with physical installation constraints 
focus on signal processing 
since inception  the company has focused much of its attention on developing signal processing equipment 
the company believes that there have been and will continue to be more opportunities to develop specialized signal processing equipment than collection equipment as new types of signals can often be collected with available collection equipment but cannot be processed by available processing equipment 
increase penetration and broaden customer base 
the company believes that its current customers offer significant additional opportunities for sales growth both in terms of additional units of developed products and the development of new products and  accordingly  directs much of its marketing efforts toward these customers 
the company attempts to broaden its customer base through marketing efforts directed at united states government agencies that are not now customers that is  certain military and law enforcement agencies as well as at offices within its customer agencies that have not contracted with the company previously 
commercial telecommunication products the company s strategy for commercial marketplace penetration is to take full advantage of the r d funded by government contracts in years past 
this r d is the result of government development contracts and the company s independent r d ir d 
as a result of these investments  the company believes it has developed technology that commercial companies require and the company attempts to seek strategic partnering relationships with certain of these commercial companies to exploit this technology 
products the company s products consist of signal collection and processing equipment that use software and hardware developed over many years by the company in the course of performing hundreds of development contracts to provide signal reconnaissance equipment to the united states government 
this software and hardware enables the company s processing equipment to evaluate large numbers of radio frequency signals and to select the relatively small proportion which contain information likely to be useful in the signal reconnaissance programs of the united states government 
further  the company has recently begun developing a line of products using existing technology for use in the commercial telecommunications market 
the company offers a variety of signal reconnaissance products  which can be categorized as follows voice grade channel processors 
these processors are designed to process voice grade channels vgcs which carry audio and other signals 
the standard telecommunication systems used throughout the world put a large number of vgcs on a single carrier channel to increase the number of signals that can be transmitted at a particular frequency 
vgc processors can scan thousands of signals in less than one second and use sophisticated processing technology to detect and record relevant data which is then analyzed by united states government personnel 
these processors evaluate the characteristics of collected signals and select signals that are likely to contain relevant information 
the company s vgc processors currently range in price from approximately  to approximately  wideband processors 
these processors clean telecommunication signals for further processing by vgc processors by adjusting for signal distortions that commonly occur during transmission 
the two primary types of distortion these processors correct are multipath interference caused by the reception of a signal and its reflections and cochannel interference caused by the reception of multiple interfering signals 
commercial telecommunications companies overcome these distortions with careful alignment and tuning which requires interruption of the telecommunication signals 
the company s wideband processors perform this alignment independently and automatically by adjusting processing parameters using proprietary adaptive algorithms that let the processors learn how to process the incoming signals 
one of the company s wideband processors processes signals that carry thousands of vgcs in a digital format which is rapidly being proliferated through the world and is particularly susceptible to distortions 
the company s wideband processors currently range in price from approximately  to approximately processing systems 
although the company has emphasized subsystem or product development since its inception  it has also developed and delivered signal processing systems in situations where the capabilities of its products have enabled it to obtain a system development contract on a sole source basis from the united states government 
the company s two largest system installations  for which the company developed custom systems software  integrated a number of the company s standard vgc processors and were developed to exacting united states government software and documentation standards 
collection products 
the company offers a limited number of signal collection products designed to complement certain of the company s processing products 
the company s collection products include a low cost  small size receiver that collects very complex signaling formats and a receiver that overcomes cochannel interference and certain forms of multipath interference by optimizing multiple antenna inputs 
the company s collection products currently range in price from approximately  to approximately  in addition to its line of signal reconnaissance products  the company has recently started development of commercial products 
the types of commercial products that the company is developing can be categorized as follows digital video processing equipment 
the company is developing a key processing function of digital demodulation in one asic to be marketed to television set top converter manufacturers 
the company has also developed the qamalyzer tm digital video analyzer test unit 
wireless local loop equipment 
the company is developing a qpsk demodulator in the form of an asic to integrate into the ericsson corporation freeset tm handset for their wireless local loop system 
customers  contracts  and marketing customers to date  purchases by the united states government have accounted for almost all of the company s revenues 
most of the company s revenues have come from contracts directly with the united states government 
the company also has subcontracts under which it supplies products or services to prime contractors that have contracts with the united states government 
subcontract revenues accounted for approximately   and of the company s total revenues for its fiscal years   and  respectively 
in addition  the company occasionally sells small quantities of equipment to foreign governments 
foreign revenues have accounted for approximately   and of the company s total revenues for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the company s united states government customers consist of approximately five military and intelligence agencies with signal reconnaissance needs 
within these five agencies  the company has contracts with approximately different offices  each with separate budgets and contracting authority 
although concentration of revenue sources is significant for the united states government  no single contract accounted for more than of the company s revenues in fiscal year  in fiscal year  or more than in fiscal year two intelligence agencies accounted for approximately and  respectively  of revenues in fiscal year  approximately and  respectively  of revenues in fiscal year  and approximately and  respectively  of revenues in fiscal year in recent years  the united states defense budget has been reduced  causing customers and potential customers of the company s products to reevaluate their needs 
the company believes that budget reductions have caused agencies increasingly to favor standard products similar to the company s products rather than custom products that generally are more expensive  take longer to deliver  and provide solutions to a narrower range of signal reconnaissance problems 
future reductions in united states government spending on signal reconnaissance equipment or future changes in the kinds of signal reconnaissance products or services required by united states government agencies  however  could limit demand for the company s products  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
contracts government contracts 
most of the company s business is conducted under contracts that include united states government security requirements 
the company s contracts with united states government agencies can be categorized in several ways 
sole source contracts are let by the united states government when a single contractor is deemed to have an expertise or technology that is superior to that of competing contractors 
potential suppliers compete informally for sole source contracts through r d investment and marketing efforts 
this competition requires a contractor to identify the united states government s requirements early and invest in developing potential solutions so that the contractor can demonstrate a distinguishing expertise or technology promptly after the united states government has identified a signal reconnaissance requirement 
competitive bid contracts are awarded after a formal bid and proposal competition among suppliers and sole source contracts are awarded without a formal competition 
during fiscal years   and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues were from sole source contracts  and approximately   and  respectively  were from competitive bid contracts 
during fiscal  the company experienced an increase in the percentage of contracts awarded on a competition basis and an increase in revenues generated from subcontracts 
this change is due to the award of one subcontract during fiscal management does not believe the shift in percentages will have a material impact on the operating results of the company 
as a government contractor  the company is subject to price redetermination on certain fixed price contracts if it is determined that the company did not price its products and services consistent with the requirements of the federal acquisition regulations 
as of october   the company has not had a material claim sustained against it for noncompliance 
in april the company was served with a subpoena by the department of defense office of inspector general oig in connection with pricing of products related to approximately six contracts 
shortly thereafter  a second agency issued a request for information related to nine additional contracts 
to date  the company has not received any allegation of wrongdoing from the oig or the other agency 
through its internal review of the contracts in question  the company has provided voluntary disclosure to the government which is expected to result in a downward price adjustment on certain contracts 
in anticipation of a settlement  the company recorded a charge of million to third quarter fiscal operating results 
in april  the company was served with a second subpoena by the oig in connection with all contracts entered into between and the present related to three products the model p voice channel demodulator  the model multichannel processor  and the model fax scanner 
while management believes this charge is adequate to cover all related risks  the government has not concluded its investigation or agreed to a settlement with the company 
see item legal proceedings 
competitive bid contracts are awarded based on objective proposal evaluation criteria established by the procuring agency 
interested contractors prepare a bid and proposal that responds to the agency s request for proposal 
a bid and proposal is usually prepared in a short period of time for example  days in response to a deadline and requires the extensive involvement of numerous technical and administrative personnel 
competitive bid or sole source contracts can be either fixed price contracts  pursuant to which the company agrees to deliver equipment for a fixed price and assumes the risk of cost overruns  or cost plus contracts  pursuant to which the company is reimbursed for its direct and indirect costs and paid a negotiated profit 
during fiscal years and  approximately of the company s revenues were from fixed price contracts and were from cost plus contracts 
during fiscal year  approximately of the company s revenues were from fixed price contracts and approximately were from cost plus contracts 
most of the company s fixed price contracts are for the manufacture of multiple units of its products  rather than the development of new products 
the company believes that the risk of cost overruns is much less in the case of fixed price manufacturing contracts  where the product already has been developed and at least a prototype made  than in the case of fixed price development contracts 
almost all of the company s contracts contain termination clauses that permit contract termination upon the company s default or for the convenience of the other contracting party 
in either case  termination could adversely affect the company s operating results 
although the company has not experienced any material cancellations in the past  there can be no assurance such cancellations will not occur in the future 
commercial contracts 
during fiscal years and  commercial contracts have accounted for approximately and of the company s revenue  respectively 
in fiscal  commercial contracts accounted for approximately of the company s revenue 
the commercial contracts are typically fixed price for development or manufacturing and often require r d investments by the company 
commercial contracting is a maturing business area for the company and due to the highly competitive nature of these commercial endeavors  there is risk that the company s investments may not produce income and that the fixed price contracts may experience cost overruns 
losses on any individual contracts are provided for at the time they become known 
marketing signal reconnaissance 
the company s primary signal reconnaissance marketing efforts consist of personal contact between government technical representatives and technical personnel of the company 
the company involves all technically qualified staff members in its marketing program 
the company believes it is extremely important to have technically knowledgeable staff make marketing contacts since an initial system concept is often developed during the first such contact 
the company believes that it has much more marketing contact with customers and potential customers than is customary among its competitors generally  and that this contact enables the company to anticipate the united states government s signal reconnaissance needs  thereby giving the company a potential advantage over its competitors 
the company s signal reconnaissance marketing occurs at three levels 
the top level of marketing involves contact between the company s senior management and officials of the united states government responsible for signal reconnaissance policy 
the purpose of these contacts is to understand national level requirements in future years five to ten years out  obtain guidance for direction of the company s r d  and keep the united states government community informed about the company  its technology  and its products 
the intermediate level of marketing is performed by the company s systems engineers contacting government officials responsible for allocating budgets 
these engineers seek to identify new requirements that will result in projects within the next six to months and work with government technical representatives to develop system concepts 
the company invests in r d to address these requirements and to obtain potential projects 
to assist with this level of marketing  the company s technical staff often constructs a theoretical model of the problem and tests processing solutions so that the company and the customer can determine whether a product can be developed or modified to meet the customer s requirements 
at this stage of marketing  the customer often awards a sole source contract to the company 
the final level of marketing involves establishing precise cost estimates and detailed specifications 
this level of marketing is performed by development engineers who are involved in the actual development or modification of the product 
in addition to its primary technical marketing  the company also conducts marketing activities designed to increase its visibility with existing and potential customers 
each year the company conducts two equipment shows in the washington  dc area demonstrating the operation of many of its products 
the company uses direct mail and magazine advertising from time to time to inform potential customers of available products 
the company also produces a product summary catalog that is updated every six months and included with the quarterly newsletter mailing 
the company s mailing list includes contacts at private sector companies that may purchase the company s products for their own use or for inclusion in systems they are developing for united states government customers  as well as contacts at united states government agencies that buy products but do not contract for development efforts 
commercial marketing 
the company s approach to marketing of commercial products is to form strategic alliances with other companies that have had experience in a particular commercial marketplace 
the company will rely on the marketing techniques of these strategic partners to attempt penetration of the new commercial marketplaces 
further  the company intends to license its technology  which the company believes should minimize the risk of lost investment in these new marketplaces 
backlog the company s backlog  which consists of anticipated revenues from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts  was million  million  and million at october    and  respectively 
anticipated revenues included in backlog may be realized over a multi year period 
the company includes a contract in backlog when the contract is executed 
the company believes the backlog figures are firm  subject only to the cancellation and modification provisions contained in its government contracts 
research and development the company conducts r d pursuant to united states government r d contracts and as part of its own r d program 
united states government r d contracts generated approximately million  of revenues in fiscal years and  and approximately million in the company s own r d program is funded both by the united states government  through reimbursement of certain of the company s r d expenditures  and by the company s own investment  which is not reimbursed 
the company s r d expenditures as a percentage of revenues in fiscal years   and were   and  respectively 
research and development conducted by the company and sponsored by the united states government excluding united states government r d contracts was million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively  while research and development conducted and sponsored by the company was million  million  and million in those same periods  respectively 
the company believes that its investment in r d provides it with a significant competitive advantage 
the company seeks to develop technology capable of addressing new signal reconnaissance requirements before its competitors 
in addition  the company focuses its r d on developing products that can be used  with or without further modification  to satisfy various needs of a variety of customers  thereby permitting the company to offer a solution promptly 
the company attempts to allocate its r d funds among projects intended to yield revenues within one to two years  projects intended to yield revenues in two to five years  and projects intended to yield revenues in more than five years 
most of the company s r d expenditures are for projects intended to yield revenues within one to two years 
an important aspect of the company s r d efforts is understanding telecommunication trends to anticipate the future signal reconnaissance needs of its customers 
not only does this allow the company to direct its r d engineering efforts to produce solutions promptly once a customer expresses a need  but it often allows the company to educate the customer about its potential needs and simultaneously present a conceptual solution to those needs 
another important aspect of the company s r d is the development of components or products utilizing advanced technology 
this enables the company to develop products superior to competing products in size  power consumption  delivery time  and cost 
the company has developed an in house capability to design very large scale integration vlsi circuits 
using its vlsi capabilities  the company has designed proprietary application specific integrated circuits that enhance the processing power of many of its signal processing products 
the company s commercial endeavors attempt to apply technology developed for signal reconnaissance to commercial areas of telecommunications 
the company intends to identify opportunities where it believes it has technology that commercial companies have not developed and can form strategic alliances with other commercial companies in an attempt to exploit these opportunities 
company divisions the company is organized into four technical divisions and a finance division 
three of the four technical divisions military reconnaissance  commercial telecommunications  and strategic systems are engineering divisions which perform all of the company s development 
the engineering divisions are primarily responsible for conducting r d and the initial development of products  while the operations division is primarily responsible for manufacturing multiple units of products 
all divisions work together to ensure that production related issues  such as manufacturability  reliability  and maintainability  are addressed from initial product definition through final product shipment 
the company s technical staff includes personnel with system development expertise  which the company applies not only to system development but also to its product development in order to ensure the compatibility of its products with a variety of system requirements 
as of january   there were employees in the engineering divisions and employees in the operations division 
see employees 
engineering 
the engineering divisions are responsible for the company s r d 
the company s r d activities include both united states government r d contracts and the company s r d projects 
the engineering division activities are directed toward developing products that will ultimately be produced by the operations division 
the engineering divisions work in conjunction with the operations division to assure that the development efforts will culminate in a product able to be manufactured efficiently in quantity 
the company has offices which also support the company s marketing activities in herndon  virginia and jessup  maryland 
as of january   there were employees in the virginia office and employees in the maryland office 
most of the personnel staffing these offices are technical personnel and  in addition to marketing activities  are involved in research and development and customer support for example  installation  training  and troubleshooting 
operations 
the operations division is responsible for completing final product development and manufacturing multiple units of products 
by combining engineering and production expertise within the operations division  the company believes it is able to maximize manufacturing efficiency and  therefore  reduce overall production costs 
operations manufactures products using batch production methods 
the division achieves labor efficiency by extensive cross training of its personnel  which permits these personnel to participate in the production of all of the company s products 
the division is also responsible for managing the company s purchases of goods and services  including third party manufacturing and assembly services 
see suppliers 
suppliers the company uses suppliers in order to obtain quality goods and services without incurring the costs of providing those goods and services in house 
the company purchases from suppliers nearly all circuit boards  integrated circuits  and other components used in its products 
in addition  the company contracts with suppliers to assemble some of its products 
the company s reliance on suppliers involves several risks  including the possibility of a shortage of certain key components and assemblies and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality  and costs 
if the company experiences significant availability or quality control problems in the future  its revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
although the company procures most of its parts and components from multiple sources or believes that these components are readily available from numerous other sources  certain components are available only from sole sources or from a limited number of sources 
a number of the company s products contain critical components like single board computers available solely from motorola  inc and force computers  inc 
and digital signal processing integrated circuits available solely from texas instruments  inc while the company believes that substitute components or assemblies could be obtained  use of substitutes would require development of new suppliers or would require the company to re engineer its products  or both  which could delay the company s shipment of its products and could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
many of the company s products currently use application specific integrated circuits asics designed by the company but manufactured by third parties 
the company purchases these asics on a purchase order basis and is required to pay for all asics produced  whether or not they perform correctly 
the company has experienced unanticipated low yields of working asics from time to time  causing the cost of products using these asics to be higher than expected 
in addition  as chip manufacturing technology evolves  the company may be forced to redesign certain cards as cards produced with older technology may no longer be manufactured 
the company may be required to bear the cost of redesign 
to date  these have not had a material adverse impact on the company s results 
the company is likely to design and use asics in new products in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will not continue to experience unanticipated low yields of working asics and therefore higher product costs  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
competition signal reconnaissance the signal reconnaissance equipment market is highly competitive and the company expects that competition will increase in the future 
some of the company s current and potential competitors have significantly greater technical  manufacturing  financial  and marketing resources than the company 
the company s current competitors include adams russell  inc a subsidiary of m a com  inc  argosystems  inc 
a subsidiary of the boeing company  e systems  inc a subsidiary of raytheon corporation  gte government systems corporation  harris corporation  lockheed martin corporation  motorola government electronics group a subsidiary of motorola  inc  and trw  inc 
substantial competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the competition for competitive bid contracts differs from the competition for sole source contracts 
companies competing for competitive bid contracts prepare bids and proposals in response to government request for proposals 
potential suppliers compete informally for sole source contracts through r d investment and marketing efforts 
companies competing for sole source contracts attempt to identify the united states government s requirements early and invest in solutions so that they can demonstrate a distinguishing expertise or technology promptly after the united states government has identified a signal reconnaissance requirement 
the company competes primarily for sole source contracts and conducts its operations accordingly 
the principal factors of competition for sole source contracts include investments in r d  the ability to respond to government needs promptly  product price relative to performance  quality  and customer support 
the company believes that it competes favorably on each of these factors 
commercial the commercial marketplace is relatively new for the company and highly competitive 
the company feels that competition can be the highest risk of commercial ventures 
the company believes that this risk may be minimized by striving to secure strategic alliances for the majority of commercial activities  including co funding of product development and marketing 
the company continues to employ a cautious  measured approach to commercial investments which should help minimize the risk and  at the same time  the company continues to nurture business relationships which are expected to result in maturing this segment of the company s business 
proprietary rights the united states government has rights to most of the technology developed by the company under government contracts  including rights to permit other companies  including the company s competitors  to use this technology to develop products for the united states government 
the company is not aware that the united states government has exercised these rights 
the company has filed limited patent applications for its technology 
as of october   one patent has been granted to the company for efficient qam equalizer demodulator with non integer sampling  and one patent is pending for the digital cable test system 
the company believes that given the rapidly changing nature of signal collection and processing technology  its future success will depend primarily upon the technical competence and creative skills of its personnel 
the company attempts to protect its trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with customers  employees  and consultants and other security measures 
there can be no assurance that the measures adopted by the company for the protection of its intellectual property will be adequate 
although the company does not believe and has not received notice that it is infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that such a claim will not be asserted against the company 
in the event any third party made a valid claim against the company and a license was not made available to the company on commercially reasonable terms  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
government regulations many of the company s operations are subject to compliance with regulatory requirements of federal  state and municipal authorities  including regulations concerning employment obligations and affirmative action  workplace safety and protection of the environment 
while compliance with applicable regulations has not adversely affected the company s operations in the past  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be in compliance in the future or that these regulations will not change 
in particular  the company must comply with detailed government procurement and contracting regulations and with united states government security regulations  certain of which carry substantial penalty provisions for nonperformance or misrepresentation in the course of negotiations 
failure of the company to comply with its government procurement or contracting obligations or security obligations could result in penalties or suspension of the company from government contracting  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
see item business customers  contracts  and marketing and item legal proceedings 
employees as of january   the company had approximately full time employees  of whom hold advanced technical degrees master and or doctoral degrees  including with doctoral degrees 
the company s business requires that a large number of its technical employees obtain security clearances from the united states government which limits the available pool of eligible candidates for such positions to those who can satisfy the prerequisites to obtaining these clearances 
in particular  the personnel involved in marketing require the appropriate clearances to meet with government technical representatives and discuss the government s signal reconnaissance needs 
the company has a united states government sanctioned security program that allows staff members to obtain appropriate clearances 
approximately of the company s current technical staff have security clearances 
the success of the company is dependent on attracting  retaining  and motivating qualified key management and technical personnel  the loss of whom  by one or more  could adversely affect the company s business 
such personnel are in great demand and limited supply 
the company believes its employees are its most valuable resource and that its workforce possesses a strong feeling of dedication to and pride in the company 
this dedication is reinforced through incentive compensation arrangements based on company performance 
the company s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements  and the company has never experienced a work stoppage 
during fiscal and into early fiscal  the company experienced increased turnover among its staff 
the company believes that this is primarily due to a much more favorable economic environment in silicon valley and to the explosive growth of the telecommunications industry creating a preponderance of new opportunities for the staff 
in response to the increased turnover  management initiated certain steps aimed at stabilizing the turnover rate and attracting new talent during fiscal the continuing challenge confronting the company in fiscal will be to attract and retain qualified staff to support the company s growth objectives 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in this area 
summary of business considerations and certain factors that may affect future results of operations and or stock price defense and intelligence agencies have accounted for almost all of the company s revenues 
future reductions in united states government spending on signal reconnaissance equipment or future changes in the kind of signal reconnaissance products or services required by united states government agencies could limit demand for the company s products which would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
the signal reconnaissance equipment market is highly competitive and the company expects that competition will increase in the future 
some of the company s current and potential competitors have significantly greater technical  manufacturing  financial and marketing resources than the company 
substantial competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company believes its employees are its most valuable resource and  accordingly  focuses much of its attention on attracting and retaining staff members 
over the last year  the company has experienced an increase in its attrition rate as well as a difficulty in attracting new talent into the company due to increased competition for qualified personnel 
management believes these effects are attributable to the expanding us economy and  in particular  the local california economy where the company must compete for new talent in the rapidly expanding telecommunications sector 
the company has implemented a more aggressive recruiting program and an employee referral program aimed at countering this new environment 
the company s ability to execute its business plan is contingent upon attracting and retaining qualified employees 
while the company believes progress has been made during the most recent quarters  there can be no assurances that the company will be successful at attracting and retaining sufficient personnel 
failure to do so will have a material adverse effect on the company s future operating results 
almost all of the company s contracts contain termination clauses which permit contract termination upon the company s default or for the convenience of the other contracting party 
in either case  termination could adversely affect the company s operating results 
although the company has not experienced any material cancellations to date  there can be no assurances that such cancellations will not occur in the future 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are derived from fixed price contracts 
under fixed price contracts  unexpected increases in the cost to develop or manufacture a product  whether due to inaccurate estimates in the bidding process  unanticipated increases in materials costs  inefficiencies or other factors  are borne by the company 
the company has experienced cost overruns in the past that have caused the company to realize losses on contracts 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience cost overruns in the future or that such overruns will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company has experienced some constraint in earnings resulting from lower average profitability on its production jobs 
this is due  in part  to the unfavorable adjustments in estimated costs to complete on production jobs recorded during the fiscal year and due  in part  to absorbing unrecoverable indirect costs at a rate higher than was provided for in the contract prices of these contracts 
the company has taken several steps aimed at improving its contract margins 
this includes revising prices of its products and services  review of operational processes for efficiency  and examining its cost structures 
although the company believes some improvements were apparent in the operating results for the third quarter of fiscal year  there can be no assurances that these steps will result in improved margins on future results of operations 
the company has experienced significant fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter and expects that it will continue to experience such fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations are caused by  among other factors  factors inherent in government contracting and the company s business such as the timing of cost and expense recognition for contracts and the united states government contracting and budget cycles 
fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology 
the company believes that it has been successful to date in identifying united states government signal reconnaissance needs early  investing in research and development to meet these needs and delivering products before the company s competitors 
the company believes that its future success will depend upon continuing to develop and introduce  in a timely manner  products capable of collecting or processing new types of telecommunications signals 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop and market new products successfully in the future or respond effectively to technological changes or that new products introduced by others will not render the company s products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
the company has had numerous discussions with companies in the commercial cable tv video compression and telecommunications marketplaces 
the company s primary business strategy in this area is to capitalize on its experience as a technology company and to explore areas where current or newly developed technology can be licensed or products can be manufactured and sold into the commercial marketplace 
to date  revenues from the commercial marketplace have been less than of the company s revenues and have consisted primarily of product development fees 
there can be no assurance that the company s commercial marketplace strategy will be successful or that the company will maintain or increase revenues from the commercial marketplace 
there can be no assurance that an active trading market will be sustained for the company s common stock 
further  the market price of the common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  united states government spending patterns and other factors 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many technology companies and that have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic and market conditions  may adversely affect the future market price of the company s common stock

item legal proceedings in april  the company was served with a subpoena by the department of defense office of inspector general oig in connection with approximately six contracts  several of which had been audited by the defense contract audit agency dcaa the previous year 
as is routine in such matters involving government contracts  the oig referred the matter to another government agency which also had contracts with the company 
shortly thereafter  this second agency issued a request for information related to nine additional contracts 
to date  the company has not received any allegations of wrong doing from the oig or the other agency 
at the request of the board of directors  the company initiated its own review of the contracts in conjunction with its legal counsel 
further review of the contracts in question and related contracts through april indicated the company was not compliant with public law  truth in negotiations act  which requires disclosure of all actual costs available on the date of cost certification on certain contracts performed during the and timeframe 
these findings have resulted in a voluntary disclosure to the government which is expected to result in a downward price adjustment on certain contracts

the charge resulted in a reduction of the fiscal third quarter s operating income of million

the company is presently in discussions with the oig to determine the scope of the subpoena and intends to fully comply with the request 
while management believes the fiscal year third quarter charge is adequate to cover all related risks  the government has not concluded its investigation or agreed to a settlement with the company 
there can be no assurances the company will not be required to take additional charges in connection with this matter in future periods 
however  management believes that any such charges would not have a material effect on the operating results and financial condition of the company
