the company recently commenced operations in ukraine and southern poland and has operations under development in other areas of poland and hungary which  in the aggregate  potentially could reach an additional million people 
the company s strategy is to continue capitalizing on the substantial market opportunities created by the emergence of private commercial television and the corresponding significant growth of television advertising expenditures in these markets 
the company s revenues are derived principally from the sale of television advertising to local  national and international advertisers 
to a limited extent  the company also engages in certain barter transactions in which its broadcast operations exchange unsold commercial advertising time for goods and services 
the company experiences seasonality  with advertising sales tending to be lowest during the third quarter of each calendar year  which includes the summer holiday schedule typically july and august  and highest during the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
the primary expenses incurred in operating broadcast stations are programming costs  employee salaries  broadcast transmission expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
certain of the company s operations do not require the direct incurrence of broadcast transmission expenses 
license fees payable to governmental entities in connection with securing television licenses from government authorities  if any  are usually minimal 
however  the company incurs significant development expenses  including funding and negotiating with local partners  researching and preparing license applications  preparing business plans and conducting pre operating activities as well as restructuring existing affiliate entities which hold the licenses 
the company conducts all of its operations through subsidiaries 
accordingly  the primary internal sources of the company s cash are dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries 
the company s ability to obtain dividends or other distributions is subject to  among other things  restrictions on dividends under applicable local laws and foreign currency exchange regulations of the jurisdictions in which its subsidiaries operate 
the subsidiaries ability to make distributions to the company is also subject to the legal availability of sufficient operating funds which are not needed for operations  obligations or other business plans and  in some cases  the approval of the other partners  stockholders or creditors of these entities 
the laws under which the company s currently operating subsidiaries are organized provide generally that dividends may be declared by the partners or shareholders out of yearly profits subject to the maintenance of registered capital and required reserves and after the recovery of accumulated losses

prior to the ipo  the company relied on certain affiliates for capital in the form of both debt and equity financing 
the company was paid a dividend of approximately  in by nova tv

primarily as a result of the offering and the results of operations of nova tv in and  the company had cash of  at december   at december  and marketable securities of  at december   at december  available to finance its future activities 
the company has made and will continue to make investments to develop broadcast operations in central and eastern europe 
the company currently is developing broadcast operations in ukraine and poland and intends to bid for a national broadcast license in hungary 
the company s cash needs for those investment activities may exceed cash generated from operations  resulting in external financing requirements 
on august   the company entered into the additional nova tv purchase for the purchase of cs s economic interest and virtually all of cs s voting rights in nova tv for a purchase price of kc billion 
the company also entered into a loan agreement with cs to finance of the purchase price 
the remainder of the purchase price kc  million  was paid by the company on november  out of the company s cash balances 
the loan from cs was drawn in august and is expected to be drawn in april in the amounts of kc   and kc   respectively to fund purchase payments due at those times  and the loan bears an interest rate of annually 
quarterly repayments on the loan are required in the amount of kc   during the period from november through november  kc   during the period from february through august  and kc   during the period from november through november the company expects that nova tv s future cash requirements will continue to be satisfied through operating cash flows and available borrowing facilities 
nova tv currently has two loan facilities with cs 
the first facility consists of a long term loan due on december  in the principal amount of kc   and bears interest at a rate of over the bank s prime rate  currently 
principal payments of kc   are due each year on this facility 
in january nova tv paid the kc   due on this facility for the second facility is a line of credit  obtained in november  for an amount up to kc   bearing interest at a rate over prague interbank offer rate pribor 
this facility was unutilized at december  these loans are secured by nova tv s equipment  vehicles and receivables 
pro tv has two borrowing facilities with tiriac bank in romania which were obtained in july the first facility consists of  line of credit substantially payable by july  the line of credit bears interest at a rate of over libor at december  
at december   was borrowed under this facility 
the second facility is a long term loan for  due july  the long term loan bears interest at over libor at december  and is repaid in installments starting july  at december   was borrowed under this facility 
these facilities are secured by pro tv s equipment and vehicles 
notwithstanding these borrowing facilities  the company believes that it will be required to provide additional funding to pro tv in puls  in which the company has a substantial equity investment  continues to require additional cash funding to meet ongoing operating deficits 
the company estimates total cash funding required for puls to be approximately  through june none of the investors in puls  including the company  have further contractual obligations to invest additional capital in this station 
the partners of puls have retained a financial advisor and are currently in discussions with potential investors in puls 
such an investment would be expected to acquire a significant equity interest in puls and assume responsibility for puls operations 
such an investor would be anticipated to significantly dilute the company s equity interest in puls and to decrease the company s future funding obligations to puls 
furthermore  such investment also could result in a material reduction of the carrying value of the company s equity investment in puls which was million at december  and a corresponding charge against the company s earnings 
regardless of whether a transaction with an investor is consummated  there is no assurance that the company may not have to take a reduction of all or a portion of the carrying value of puls 
in addition  a reduction of the carrying value of puls  or other factors  might cause the company to reduce all or part of the carrying value of the company s investments in fff the parent company of the nuremberg station and sff through which the company owns its interests in the leipzig station and the dresden station  which were million and million  respectively  as of december  the laws under which the company s currently operating subsidiaries and affiliates are organized provide generally that dividends may be declared by the partners or shareholders out of yearly profits subject to the maintenance of registered capital  required reserves and after the recovery of accumulated losses 
in the case of the company s dutch and netherlands antilles subsidiaries  the company s voting power is sufficient to compel the making of distributions 
the company s voting power is sufficient to compel nova tv to make distributions 
in the case of pro tv  distributions may be paid from the profits of pro tv subject to a reserve of of annual profits until the aggregate reserves equal of pro tv s registered capital 
a majority vote can compel pro tv to make distributions 
in the case of pop tv  the company s voting power is not sufficient to compel the payment of dividends 
there are no legal reserve requirements in slovenia 
in the case of markiza tv  distributions may be paid from net profits subject to an initial reserve requirement of of net profits until the reserve fund equals of registered capital 
subsequently  the reserve requirement is equal to of net profits until the reserve fund equals of registered capital 
the company s voting power in markiza tv is not sufficient to compel the distribution of dividends 
in the case of puls  the puls partnership agreement provides that if profits are available for distribution  of the partnership interest may require that of such profits be placed in reserves until dm   are reserved 
all profits in excess thereof must be distributed 
the agreement relating to fff does not contain restrictions on distributions out of available profits 
the laws of countries where the company is developing operations contain restrictions on the payment of dividends 
except for the company s working capital requirements and completing the funding of existing television broadcast operations and the mobile telecommunications venture in romania mobilrom  the company s future cash needs will depend on management s acquisition and development decisions 
the company is actively engaged in the development of additional broadcast operations and investing in existing broadcasting companies throughout central and eastern europe 
the company incurs limited expenses in identifying and pursuing broadcast opportunities before any investment decision is made 
the company anticipates making additional investments in other broadcast operations  supplemented by capital raised from local financial strategic partners as well as local debt and lease financing  to the extent that it is available and appropriate for each project 
the company s aggregate funding commitment with respect to mobilrom is up to million  of which approximately million has been funded to date 
the company believes that its current cash balances  cash generated from nova tv and local financing of broadcast operations and broadcast operations under development should be adequate to satisfy the company s operating and capital requirements for its current operations through in order to fund the development and build out of new broadcast opportunities in central and eastern europe  the company currently is actively exploring significant additional financing at the cme level 
if the company is unsuccessful in raising such additional funds  the company may not be able to acquire additional broadcast rights or complete the development of additional broadcast opportunities
