item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the section entitled business risk factors 
general the company derives revenue principally from the sale of integrated circuits for use in communications  video and imaging  silicon microstructures and other selected areas 
the company s gross margins from sales of integrated circuits vary depending on competition from other manufacturers  the volume of products manufactured and sold  the company s ability to achieve certain manufacturing efficiencies and the cost of material procured from the company s suppliers 
the company s newer analog and mixed signal products tend to have higher gross margins than many of the company s more mature products and margins of any particular product may erode over time 
the company has wholly owned subsidiaries in japan and the united kingdom to support its sales operations in each of those areas 
the company s business in japan includes the sale of integrated circuits which are primarily for use in consumer electronics 
the company has made a number of changes in its underlying business over the past three years in an effort to reduce its low margin businesses and focus its product strategy 
at the same time  to increase its share of revenues from the sale of proprietary products and to acquire additional technology  the company made significant investments through direct acquisition of companies with related product lines 
in fiscal  the company acquired origin technology  inc  micro power and startech and in june  the company acquired smi 
the acquisitions provided the company with product offerings that include data acquisition subsystems and other sophisticated electronic components for the document imaging  communications and silicon microstructures markets 
all of the acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases and the results of operations for fiscal and include the operations of the acquired companies subsequent to the dates of acquisition 
accordingly  the operations of these companies  prior to acquisition  are not reflected in the company s historical operating results 
as a result of the acquisitions completed in fiscal and  the company recorded approximately million of goodwill  which is being amortized over a period of five years 
the remaining portion of the excess purchase price approximately million in fiscal and 
million in fiscal was allocated to acquired research and development and was expensed at the time of acquisition 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and other charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company announced and began to implement a restructuring plan to i reduce manufacturing expenses by transferring its test and shipping operations to offshore sub contractors  ii focus the company s product strategy to provide analog and mixed signal products for the video  imaging  communications and silicon sensor markets and iii narrow the company s distribution channels to create more leverage 
the company s restructuring actions consisted primarily of a write down of certain equipment  severance costs  write down of inventory  cancellation of certain facility leases  cancellation of contracts  and write down of goodwill 
these actions resulted in a charge of million to operating expenses and million to cost of goods sold in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  approximately million was utilized 
a remaining outlay of approximately  is expected to occur during fiscal in october  the company entered into a wafer production agreement with ic works  inc ic works 
under the terms of the agreement  exar invested approximately million for the purchase and installation of equipment at ic works  in exchange for a predetermined supply of wafers over the next five years 
under separate but related agreements  exar has made a minority equity investment in ic works of approximately million 
the dramatically changed market conditions for wafer pricing and availability  as well as the recent business redirection of exar  have led to a reassessment of exar s foundry relationships and process requirements 
these factors combined with delays in the commencement of anticipated production by the foundry  resulted in the termination of the wafer production agreement 
the company incurred a fourth quarter fiscal charge to operating expenses of million as a result of negotiations to terminate the company s wafer production agreement with ic works 
the reserve is being taken to reflect the anticipated realizable value of equipment supplied to the foundry by exar as part of the agreement 
the estimated realizable value of equipment supplied to the foundry is based on management s best estimate of the amount to be realized upon the ultimate disposition of its investment in the foundry and the related equipment which is anticipated to occur during fiscal the amounts the company will ultimately realize could differ materially from the estimated amounts

results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage relationship to net sales of certain cost  expense and income items 
the table and subsequent discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

operating income loss other income  net income loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net income loss fiscal vs fiscal net sales during fiscal were approximately million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately 
the company experienced decreases in net sales in essentially all of its continuing product lines 
in addition  the decrease in net sales reflects the discontinuance of hard disk drive products which represented million in sales in fiscal such decreases were offset  in part  by increased sales of pressure sensor products as a result of the june smi acquisition 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  sales to domestic customers decreased by to million 
international sales  excluding second source consumer products  decreased by to approximately million 
the significant decrease in international sales is due primarily to reduced demand for the company s consumer products in japan 
the company s international sales consist of sales from the united states to overseas customers and sales by the company s wholly owned subsidiaries in japan and the united kingdom 
sales by the company s foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the currency of the local country  while all other international sales are denominated in us dollars 
the fact that the company operates internationally gives rise to exposures from changes in currency exchange rates 
the company has adopted a set of practices to strictly minimize its foreign currency risk which includes the use  from time to time  of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge amounts receivable from its foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  foreign sales may be subject to tariffs in certain countries or with regard to certain products  however  the company s profit margin on international sales of integrated circuits  adjusted for differences in product mix  is not significantly different from that realized on its sales to domestic customers 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal excluding the inventory write off 
the corresponding decrease in gross margins is due primarily to changes in product mix and manufacturing inefficiencies due to decreased production volumes  which lead in part to the company s decision to restructure its operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company incurred additional cost of sales of approximately due to the discontinuation of certain products and related inventory write off as part of its restructuring plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
expenditures for research and development decreased approximately million compared to fiscal due primarily to reduced headcount 
expenditures for research and development  as a percentage of net sales  increased from approximately in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to the decrease in net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased by million or compared to fiscal due primarily to reduced headcount 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from approximately of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal the increase as a percentage of sales is due primarily to the decrease in net sales 
the company incurred million in compensation expenses related to the acquisition of startech during fiscal see liquidity and capital resources and note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
net interest income during fiscal decreased to from the million reported in fiscal due to lower average investment rates as well as lower levels of cash and short term investments in fiscal the company reported a loss for fiscal and recorded an effective income tax benefit of compared to the federal statutory rate of  due primarily to expenses without tax benefit and state income taxes 
the tax rate was offset  in part  by tax advantaged investment income and tax savings generated by use of the company s foreign sales corporation 
net income loss was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
excluding the effects of restructuring and other acquisition related expenses  the company s net income would have been million per share compared to million per share in fiscal excluding the effects of the write off of in process research and development and other acquisition related expenses 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operating results 
fiscal vs fiscal net sales during fiscal were approximately million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease reflects the elimination of sales of second source consumer product revenues and discontinued hard disk drive products totaling approximately million 
such decrease was offset  in part by increased sales of integrated circuits for use in data acquisition products 
in addition  the company benefited from the sale of personal computer and pressure sensor products as a result of the startech and smi acquisitions 
overall  sales of continuing proprietary products increased by approximately 
in fiscal  sales to domestic customers decreased by to million 
international sales  excluding second source consumer products  increased by to approximately million 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the corresponding increase in gross margins is due primarily to changes in product mix  including i the elimination of sales of second source consumer products in japan  ii discontinued sales of hard disk drive products  and iii the addition of higher margin product lines as a result of the acquisitions discussed above 
expenditures for research and development during fiscal increased by million or compared to fiscal as a percentage of net sales  expenditures for research and development increased from approximately in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to the decrease in net sales discussed above as well as additional headcount and additional research and development expenditures of acquired companies 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling general and administrative expenses increased from approximately of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal the increases are due primarily to the decrease in net sales 
as a result of the discontinuation of the mass storage product line  the company incurred a one time charge to operations of approximately million 
net interest income during fiscal increased to from the million reported in fiscal as higher average investment rates in fiscal more than offset lower levels of cash and short term investments 
the company s provision for income taxes is based on income from operations  excluding the write off of in process research and development  as there was no tax benefit associated with such write off 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal  before the write off of in process research and development  was compared to the federal statutory rate of  due primarily to state income taxes and foreign income which is taxed at rates different from us income tax rates offset  in part  by tax advantaged investment income and tax savings generated by use of the company s foreign sales corporation 
excluding the effects of the write off of in process research and development and other acquisition related expenses  the company reported net income of million per share compared to million per share in fiscal quarterly results the following table contains selected unaudited quarterly financial data for the fiscal years ended march  and in the opinion of management  this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth therein

shares used in computation         factors that may affect future results the company is currently transferring its test and shipping operations to offshore sub contractors to reduce manufacturing expenses 
in addition  the company has refocused its product strategy to provide analog and mixed signal products for the video imaging  communications and silicon sensor markets and  therefore  has eliminated certain product offerings 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by economic downturns resulting in diminished product demand  erosion of average selling prices  intense competition  rapid technological change  occasional shortages of materials  dependence upon highly skilled engineering and other personnel and significant expenditures for product development 
in addition  the cyclical market patterns of the semiconductor industry periodically results in shortages of wafer fabrication capacity 
the company s ability to meet customer future demand is dependent upon obtaining sufficient supply of products 
the company s operations have reflected  and may in the future reflect  substantial fluctuation from period to period as a result of the above factors  as well as general economic conditions  the timing of orders from major customers  variations in manufacturing efficiencies  exchange rate fluctuations  the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  management decisions to commence or discontinue certain product lines  and the company s ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a cost effective and timely basis 
exar s future operating results could be adversely affected by a downturn in this market or by the failure of one or more of its customers to compete successfully in such market 
the markets for components used in personal computer and consumer electronics products are extremely price competitive
