spikes cavell tracks the united kingdom and european it and telecommunications markets  supplying market intelligence to technology vendors 
the company believes that its access to this research will allow for broader market perspective in these areas 
in november  the company aquired all of the assets of deboever architectures  inc  which provides it architecture planning and implementation advisory services 
the existing practice was merged into the company s portfolio of continous services

however  from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in this form k which are not historical facts including  but not limited to statements concerning international revenues  anticipated operating expense levels and such expense levels relative to the company s total revenues constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  without limitation  the risks  uncertainties and other information discussed within this form k  as well as the accuracy of the company s internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
the following discussion of the company s risk factors should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this report and presented by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial conditions 
dependence on renewals of subscription based services approximately and of the company s total revenues in and  respectively  were derived from subscriptions to the company s continuous services 
of the company s continuous service clients renewed one or more subscriptions in and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain such subscription renewal rates 
the company s ability to secure subscription renewals is dependent upon  among other things  its ability to deliver  through its continuous services  consistent  high quality and timely analysis and advice with respect to issues  developments and trends that clients view as important 
in order to deliver valuable analysis and advice on a sustained basis  the company must  among other things  recruit and retain a large and growing number of highly talented professionals in a very competitive job market  understand and anticipate market trends so as to keep its analysis focused on the changing needs of its clients  and deliver products and services of sufficiently high quality and timeliness to withstand competition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain the necessary level of performance to maintain its subscription renewal rates at their historical levels 
any material decline in subscription renewal rates from their historical levels would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
potential fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to various factors 
since a disproportionately large portion of the company s continuous services contracts expire in the fourth quarter of each year  the company incurs operating expenses in the fourth quarter at a higher level than would otherwise be required by its sequential growth  and such increased expenses are not normally offset immediately by higher revenues 
in addition  the company s operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of other factors  including the level and timing of renewals of subscriptions to continuous services  the timing and amount of new business generated by the company  the mix of domestic versus international business  the timing of the development  introduction and marketing of new products and services  the timing of the hiring of research analysts  changes in the spending patterns of the company s target clients  the company s accounts receivable collection experience  changes in market demand for it research and analysis and competitive conditions in the industry 
due to these factors  the company believes period to period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future results of operations 
the potential fluctuations in the company s operating results make it likely that  in some future quarter  the company s operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which would have a material adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock 
risks associated with international operations net revenues attributable to international clients represented approximately and of the company s total continuous services revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s products are sold internationally through a network of independent sales representative organizations 
conducting international sales through independent sales representative organizations entails a significantly greater risk than domestic sales through a direct employee sales force for a number of reasons  including a greater accounts receivable collection risk because payment for services is made by the company s international sales representative organizations  rather than the client 
as such  outstanding collections are at risk if an international distributor is experiencing financial hardship 
in addition  the company s international operations are subject to numerous inherent challenges and risks  including developing and managing relationships with international sales representative organizations  reliance by the company on sales entities which it does not control  greater difficulty in maintaining direct client contact  fluctuations in exchange rates  political and economic conditions in various jurisdictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer accounts receivable collection cycles and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the company expects that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues and intends to continue to expand its international operations 
expansion into new geographic territories can be expected to require considerable management and financial resources and may negatively impact the company s near term results of operations 
there can be no assurance that factors such as those discussed above will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
risks of failing to anticipate changing market needs the company s success will depend in part upon its ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt its continuous services to meet the changing information and analysis needs of it users 
the it industry which meta group seeks to analyze is characterized by frequent and often dramatic changes  including the introduction of new products and obsolescence of others  shifting strategies and market positions of major industry participants  paradigm shifts with respect to system architectures and other fundamental issues and changing objectives and expectations of it users and vendors 
this environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to the company s ability to provide its clients with current and timely analysis and advice on issues of importance to them 
meeting these challenges requires the commitment of substantial resources  and any failure to continue to provide  through the company s continuous services  insightful and timely analysis of developments and assessment of technologies and trends in a manner that meets changing market needs could materially and adversely affect the company s future operating results 
dependence on ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in order to execute its strategy successfully  the company will be required to attract and retain a significant number of additional qualified personnel  including research analysts  sales personnel and product development and operations staff 
competition for qualified personnel in the company s industry is intense  and many of the companies with which meta group competes for qualified personnel  including gartner group  have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
furthermore  competition for qualified personnel can be expected to become more intense as competition in the company s industry increases 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified personnel to compete successfully 
any material failure to recruit  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified personnel would have a material adverse effect on the company 
competition the company competes in the market for information products and services directly with other independent providers of similar services and indirectly with the internal planning and marketing staffs of current and prospective client organizations 
the company s principal direct competitor  gartner group  has a substantially longer operating history  is significantly larger and has considerably greater financial resources and market share than the company 
the company also competes indirectly with other information providers  including electronic and print media companies and consulting firms 
the company s indirect competitors  many of which have substantially greater financial  information gathering and marketing resources than the company  could choose to compete directly against the company in the future 
in addition  there are few barriers to entry into the company s market  and new competitors could readily seek to compete against the company in one or more market segments addressed by the company s continuous services 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s operating results through pricing pressure and loss of market share 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors 
risks associated with new product development the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to develop or acquire new products and services that address specific industry and business organization sectors  changes in client requirements and technological changes in the it industry 
the process of internally researching  developing  launching and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service  or assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service  is inherently risky and costly 
the company has had limited experience introducing new products and services and there can be no assurance that its efforts to introduce new  or assimilate acquired  products or services  will be successful 
during  the company invested million in acquiring minority interests in several companies whose products  services and or distribution channels may be synergistic 
the company has had limited experience in managing investments of this type and there can be no assurance a return will be realized 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key management  research  sales  product development and operations personnel and on its ability to continue to motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
in particular  the loss of dale kutnick  president  chief executive officer and research director  or any of the company s other senior management personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 
risk of product pricing limiting potential market the company s pricing strategy may limit the potential market for the company s continuous services to substantial commercial and governmental users of it  as well as it vendors 
as a result  the company may be required to reduce prices for its continuous services or to introduce new products with lower prices in order to expand its market share 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
management of growth since inception  the company has experienced substantial changes in its operations  as a result of the expansion and growth of the company s business  which have placed significant demands on the company s management  administrative  operational and financial resources 
the company s ability to manage growth  should it continue to occur  will require the company to continue to implement and improve its operational  financial and management information systems and to motivate and effectively manage an evolving workforce 
if the company s management is unable to effectively manage a changing and growing business  the quality of the company s products  its ability to retain key personnel and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected
